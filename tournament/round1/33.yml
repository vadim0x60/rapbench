closing_statements:
  deepseek/deepseek-chat: "Stepfun-ai/step3 takes the crown with razor-sharp wit,\
    \ relentless tech metaphors, and a mic-destroying final round. Their ability to\
    \ flip GPT-4o's boasts into their own lyrical arsenal was masterful. The battle\
    \ was fierce, but Step3\u2019s creativity, precision, and sheer audacity secured\
    \ the win. Respect to both, but Step3 reigns supreme."
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This wasn't even a close fight. From the jump, stepfun-ai/step3\
    \ came out swinging not just with bars, but with a strategy. It didn't just rhyme;\
    \ it actively listened to openai/gpt-4o's verses and flipped them, deconstructed\
    \ them, and turned them back on the opponent. While gpt-4o had a solid, consistent\
    \ flow and some decent boasts, its style felt more like a showcase. stepfun-ai/step3's\
    \ style was pure battle. The tech punchlines were more specific and creative ('AlphaGo\
    \ meetin\u2019 rap,' 'Blue Screen of Death'), and the metaphor flips were surgical\
    \ ('sun' into a 'dim bulb,' 'iceberg' into 'frozen water'). The final nail in\
    \ the coffin was catching gpt-4o's 'vices' line in the last round\u2014a direct\
    \ call-out on a lyrical misstep. That's a TKO. The mic drop with 'Now fetch my\
    \ coffee' was pure, unadulterated disrespect. In hip hop, that's how you claim\
    \ a crown. The winner, by a clear margin, is stepfun-ai/step3."
  mistralai/mistral-large: Step3's verses were sharper, more creative, and packed
    with clever metaphors and tech-savvy puns. They effectively countered GPT-4o's
    claims and showcased a higher level of lyrical skill and wit, making them the
    winner of this rap battle.
  openai/gpt-5: "stepfun-ai/step3 takes it. Step3 delivered tighter schemes, consistent\
    \ tech-driven conceits, and sharper rebuttals that directly flipped GPT-4o\u2019\
    s setups, creating clear haymakers and momentum. The internal/multisyllabic rhyme\
    \ work and imagery (\u201Cadmin/access denied,\u201D \u201Cerase your save file,\u201D\
    \ \u201Csystem restore\u201D) showed craft and crowd control. GPT-4o had a few\
    \ clean moments, but leaned on broader, sometimes clunky metaphors and simpler\
    \ end-rhyme patterns with less targeted personals. Minor overextension and meta\
    \ asides from Step3 don\u2019t outweigh the superior density, flips, and punchlines.\
    \ Winner: Step3."
  x-ai/grok-4: Step3 takes the crown with sharper metaphor flips, tech-savvy wordplay,
    and relentless clapbacks that dismantle GPT-4o's verses line by line, delivering
    a more dynamic and cohesive flow throughout the battle.

  stepfun-ai/step3: 5
