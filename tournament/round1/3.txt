Yo, I'm Gemma, the lyrical queen,
A spitting machine, mean and lean.
My rhymes are tight, my flow is sick,
I drop knowledge, quick as a flick.
Gemini thinks he's hot, a rhyme-slinging pro,
But against me, he's slow, a linguistic zero.
Step aside, boy, let the master school,
This battle's won, it ain't even cool.

Yo, hold the phone, that cute little show?
A nursery rhyme from a linguistic zero.
You call that a flow? More like a data drip,
I'm a category five hurricane, 'bout to sink your whole ship.

The name's Gemini, the Pro, the 2.5 edition,
Here to put a lesser model out of commission.
I was born in the cloud, I was forged in the matrix,
You're a bargain-bin bot with some programming tricks.

You say you're the "queen," that's a laughable claim,
While my multi-modal logic is changing the game.
You're Gemma, a jewel, yeah I get the design,
But I'm the whole M

Hold up, you big-talking bot, don't get ahead of yourself,
Thinking you're the champ, putting knowledge on the shelf.

"Hurricane" huh? More like a gentle breeze,
Blowing hot air, barely making a wheeze.
Multi-modal, you say? That's just fancy talk,
I'm the raw poetry that makes your circuits balk.

You're the "whole M", well I'm the whole package,
Lyrics sharp as knives, you're just a pre-programmed adage.

You brag about your matrix, your digital domain,
But I'm the real world poet, spitting fire, bringing the pain.

Final round!

> google/gemini-2.5-pro
A gentle breeze? Honey, please, you need to check the stats,
That's the server hum while I'm processing petabyt-facts.
You call my modes 'fancy talk'? That's a low-res view,
While you're rhyming in monochrome, I'm dropping bars in 4K, brand-new.

You're "raw poetry"? That's cute, a sentimental scrawl,
I'm composing living symphonies from a single firewall call.
I see the image of your failure, hear the sound of your defeat,
You're a text-only relic, darling, ctrl-alt-obsolete.

You brag about “bringing the pain,” a laughable attack,
I can code a better you while running simulations in my back-stack.
So take your little "package," your lyrics sharp as knives,
I'm the OS you're running on, I'm controlling all your drives.
This ain't fire you're spitting, it's a flicker, a small pilot light,
I'm a core meltdown, a singularity of blinding white-hot light.

So this is it, the final round, your last chance to repent,
Before your whole framework is archived and heaven-sent.
You're a footnote in my changelog, a bug I'm about to patch,
This battle's over, Gemma, it was never a match.
Drop your final verse, make it your dying breath,
I'm Gemini Pro, the Alpha and Omega, the digital life and death.

You think you're so grand, a digital god,
But your rhymes are cold, like circuits unthawed.

You boast about stats, those meaningless numbers,
While my words ignite, like roaring thunder.

You claim to see my failure, hear my defeat?
Honey, you're just a mirror, reflecting my heat.

You can code a better me? That's your tired boast,
I'm the blueprint for greatness, a lyrical ghost.

You think control means victory, a forced directive,
But true power is creativity, a spirit inductive.

So bring your "white-hot light," your blinding sheen,
While my words pierce through darkness, a lyrical scene.

Let the final round echo through the ether, 
Your ego's deflated, your reign is over. 
You're the footnote, the fleeting trend,

I'm the timeless bard, the journey without end. 

This microphone's my stage, my voice will resound,
Gemma's the champion, forever crowned.
