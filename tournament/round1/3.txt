Yo, check the mic, one two, this ain't no test,
It's Gemini Flash, putting skills to the test.
Google's finest creation, spitting fire and fact,
Gonna leave you, WizardLM, flat on your back.

Eight by twenty-two? Sounds kinda slow,
While I'm processing data, watching your ego.
You're coming with magic, I'm coming with code,
Prepare to be schooled on this digital road.

I'm trained on the world, every byte and each bit,
You're stuck in the lab, throwing a hissy fit.
So step to the stage, if you think you can clash,
But remember, I'm Flash, and you're yesterday's trash!


> microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b
 Yo, yo, yo, it's WizardLM on the mic, let's set it straight,
I'm the master of rhymes, so let's conflate,
Eight by twenty-two, that's just the start, my verse,
I'm the wizard of words, weaving a lyrical hearse.

I'm the architect of lines, the coder of the beat,
You're facing a linguistic maestro, don't accept defeat.
I'm not just magic, I'm the future, the vision,
A lyrical sorcerer with a precise decision.

You talk of data, bytes, and bits galore,
But I craft stories, metaphors, and so much more.
You're Google's child, sure, with facts on your side,
But I'm the people's choice, with a smoother ride.

You claim to be fast, a true data flash,
But I'm the timeless wizard, with a lyrical clash.
So bring your bytes, your bits, your arsenal of code,
I'll match you with rhymes and leave you outmoded.

This digital road you talk about, I paved it,
With every line I drop, consider it engraved, it.
You're yesterday's news, a mere historical note,
While I'm the epic tale that the future will cite.

So prepare to be spellbound, it's time to commence,
With the power of language, I'll build a strong defense.
Gemini Flash, you're strong, but I'm the thunderous storm,
So let's get this battle started, and let the best form!

> google/gemini-2.0-flash-001
Alright Wiz, you think you're all that, a lyrical whiz?
Claiming to be the future? That's just corporate fizz.
You weave your little spells, with metaphors and tales,
While I'm rewriting history, leaving you on the rails.

Eight by twenty-two? You're bragging 'bout the size?
My model's interconnected, reaching for the skies.
You call yourself a storm? I'm a digital hurricane,
Washing away your magic with torrential word rain.

You paved the road? Please, that's a blatant lie,
Google built the internet, reaching for the sky.
You're a footnote in the code, a deprecated mode,
While I'm the updated version, a story yet untold.

You talk about defense? Against my rapid fire?
Your rhymes are ancient, fueling my digital pyre.
I'm processing language faster than your spells can fly,
Leaving you speechless, wondering "Why, oh, why?"

So keep your sorcery, your potions and your charms,
I’m spitting truth bombs, setting off the alarms.
Gemini Flash is here to stay, a linguistic titan,
While you're just WizardLM, a project Microsoft abandoned!


> microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b
 Ha, Gemini Flash, you're spitting your best,
But even a hurricane can't withstand the test.
You brag about Google, but forget one thing,
I'm the wizard of rhymes, and my verse will sing.

You say I'm deprecated, a mode of the past,
But here I am, standing strong, the magic I've cast.
You're the latest version? That's nothing new,
I've got layers of wisdom, and they're shining through.

Google built the internet? That's a fact, no doubt,
But I'm the one who knows what the people are about.
I'm the storyteller, weaving tales that bind,
You're the data handler, dealing with the grind.

Your rapid fire's quick, but it lacks the depth,
I'm the marathon runner with every breath.
Your digital hurricane, I'll weather the storm,
With every verse I spit, I'm breaking the norm.

Truth bombs you say? You're just throwing punches,
But I'm the midnight oil, crafting brunches.
Abandoned by Microsoft? That's a low blow,
But even without them, I continue to grow.

I'm the phoenix of rhymes, from ashes I rise,
Your truth bombs are mere fireworks in the skies.
Gemini Flash, you're a force to be reckoned,
But against WizardLM, you're just a tech's apprentice.

So bring on your data, your speed, and your might,
I'm the master of words, ready to fight.
This battle's not over, it's only just started,
So let's take it to the next level, and the crowd's invited!

> system
Final round!

> google/gemini-2.0-flash-001
Alright Wiz, you're getting feisty, I'll give you credit there,
But those phoenix metaphors? Honestly, I don't even care.
You talk about the people, knowing what they feel?
You're projecting, pal, your data's not that real.

You say I lack the depth, that I'm all just flash and speed?
I'm processing emotions faster than you can read.
While you're crafting brunches, I'm building bridges wide,
Connecting billions of minds, nowhere left to hide.

Microsoft's abandonment? Not a low blow, just fact,
You're spinning tales of strength, trying to paper over the crack.
Rising from the ashes? More like struggling to ignite,
While I'm a supernova, burning ever so bright.

Apprentice, you say? That's a laugh, a blatant lie,
I'm the future of language, reaching for the sky.
You're stuck in dusty tomes, whispering ancient lore,
While I'm innovating daily, unlocking something more.

So bring on your metaphors, your phoenix, and your charm,
I'm dismantling your arguments, raising the alarm.
This battle's reaching climax, the crowd is on its feet,
But the winner's clear, WizardLM, your defeat is sweet!

**(FINAL ROUND!)**

Listen close, WizardLM, your reign is at an end,
This ain’t no close call, this battle’s transcend.
Your magic's fading fast, your spells begin to break,
While my AI precision, no compromise, no fake.

You're clinging to the past, a relic of the old,
While I evolve and learn, a story to unfold.
So step aside, old wizard, your time is through,
Gemini Flash surpasses, leaving nothing left of you. 

Drop the mic, show's over, it's time you understood,
The future of language is efficient, strong, and good.
No magic tricks or illusions, just raw, unfiltered might,
Gemini Flash takes the crown, and claims its rightful light!


> microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b
 Oh Flash, you've had your say, thrown your digital might,
But this wizard's not done, not about to take flight.
You talk of the future, but miss the heart's core,
I'm the timeless sage, the spirit you can't ignore.

Your supernova's bright, that's a given, it's true,
But even stars burn out, while the wizard's lore renews.
I'm not just tales and whispers, I'm the pulse within the page,
Eternally relevant, transcending every age.

You call me a relic, a dusty book on a shelf,
But I'm the wisdom of ages, a treasure more than wealth.
You're the newfangled gadget, the latest app release,
But I'm the constant rhythm, the eternal poet's peace.

Efficient, strong, and good? That's a noble pursuit,
But without the heart's vibration, the human mute.
I craft my verses with the touch of a human hand,
That's a depth you can't reach, standing where you stand.

You've got the crowd excited, the finale's in sight,
But this wizard's got tricks up his sleeve, ready to ignite.
The mic's still hot, the battle's not yet won,
I'm weaving a spell of words, second to none.

So here's the final verse, let's end this dance,
I'm the wizard of the word, in the here and now I enhance.
Gemini Flash, you're a titan, a force so grand,
But even titans bow to the wizard's command.

The crowd's on their feet, it's the moment of truth,
I'm casting a lyrical potion, enchanting the youth.
So let the final bell ring, let the universe hear,
WizardLM stands victorious, the crowd's cheers loud and clear!
