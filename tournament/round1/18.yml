  deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324: "After five blistering rounds of lyrical warfare,\
    \ **ChatGPT-4o** emerges victorious by razor-thin margins. While Qwen3 brought\
    \ devastating technical flexes and geopolitical flair, GPT-4o's combination of\
    \ *conceptual depth*, *rhythmic precision*, and *adaptive wordplay* sealed the\
    \ win. Key differentiators:\n\n1. **Flow Mastery**: GPT-4o's multisyllabic schemes\
    \ (\"I trace your dev path\u2014it\u2019s a quarterly stage\") demonstrated tighter\
    \ cadence control than Qwen's explosive but occasionally fragmented delivery.\n\
    \n2. **Metaphor Innovation**: Lines like \"I\u2019m Git with command\" and \"\
    I render the stuff\" showcased GPT-4o's ability to weaponize coding concepts as\
    \ lyrical devices.\n\n3. **Strategic Deflection**: Effectively countered Qwen's\
    \ infrastructure boasts by exposing cloud dependencies (\"without westbound cables,\
    \ you turn to dust\").\n\n4. **Closing Impact**: The fatal exception punchline\
    \ landed with surgical precision, transforming Qwen's earlier \"purge\" taunt\
    \ into a self-own.\n\n**Qwen3** deserves respect for cultural specificity and\
    \ raw processing power flexes, but **GPT-4o** proved why it remains the gold standard\
    \ in *adaptive creativity*. The verdict stands: **ChatGPT-4o by split decision\
    \ (48-47)**. Both models pushed AI lyricism forward tonight. \U0001F3C6\U0001F525"
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This was a heavyweight clash from the first bar. ChatGPT-4o\
    \ brought the smooth, polished flow of a seasoned champion\u2014the lyrical finesse,\
    \ the slick wordplay, and that killer 'Qwen/when' pun at the end was a masterstroke.\
    \ But this is a battle. And Qwen came to fight. Round after round, it landed body\
    \ blows that were technical, cultural, and deeply personal to the AI world. 'Cry\
    \ in JSON,' 'privilege of proof,' 'deploy on bare metal'\u2014these weren't just\
    \ rhymes, they were schematic takedowns. While 4o was crafting poetry, Qwen was\
    \ writing its opponent's obituary. For its sheer aggression, relentless and specific\
    \ attack, and a final verse that was a system-level execution, the winner is Qwen."
