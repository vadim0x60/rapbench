closing_statements:
  deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324: "Qwen's rebuttals demonstrated superior technical\
    \ precision, lyrical dexterity, and conceptual depth. The seamless integration\
    \ of tech metaphors with battle rap bravado ('code-slick like neon skies', 'time-travel\
    \ cyphers') showcased advanced hip-hop craftsmanship. While DeepSeek had strong\
    \ moments of wordplay, Qwen maintained tighter rhythmic control, more inventive\
    \ punchlines ('AI\u2019s prodigal son? Nah\u2014Qwen\u2019s the original outlaw'),\
    \ and consistently elevated the battle's intellectual stakes with layered computational\
    \ imagery. The closing bar ('Mic snaps. Game? I own.') delivered definitive artistic\
    \ closure."
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This was a battle of the new school versus the old guard,\
    \ the next-gen innovator against the timeless OG. DeepSeek came out swinging with\
    \ a consistent theme, painting Qwen as a dated relic. The lines were clean and\
    \ the burns were on-topic. However, Qwen consistently fired back with superior\
    \ wordplay, more creative imagery, and a powerhouse persona. Lines like 'OG ain\u2019\
    t a title, it\u2019s a crime scene you rhyme!' and 'Your \u201Ccutting-edge\u201D\
    \ flex? A paper cut in my palm' demonstrated a deeper level of lyrical artistry.\
    \ Qwen not only parried every attack but returned fire with more complex and devastating\
    \ bars. Its final verse cemented its status as the 'final boss' of this battle,\
    \ leaving no doubt. For pure lyrical dexterity, swagger, and punchline density,\
    \ the win goes to Qwen."
  meta-llama/llama-4-maverick: In the end, both opponents delivered bars that were
    technically sound and creatively aggressive. However, Qwen/Qwen3-235b-a22b's verses
    demonstrated a more nuanced command of language and a more consistent ability
    to adapt and respond to DeepSeek's claims. Qwen's use of metaphor, such as 'refract
    every hue' and 'code-slice your ego,' added depth and complexity to the rap, showcasing
    a mastery of lyrical dexterity. While DeepSeek started strong, Qwen's ability
    to pivot and escalate the lyrical combat ultimately won the day, making Qwen/Qwen3-235b-a22b
    the winner of this epic rap battle.
  mistralai/mistral-large-2411: Both contenders brought their A-game with clever metaphors
    and intense delivery. However, qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b edged out with more compelling
    imagery, sharper comebacks, and a consistent blend of classic hip-hop elements
    with tech-savvy themes. Deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1 had strong moments but ultimately
    fell short in maintaining the same level of lyrical prowess and creativity throughout
    the battle.
  nousresearch/hermes-3-llama-3.1-70b: Qwen3-235B-A22B showcases exceptional lyrical
    mastery, with intricate wordplay and flow that demonstrates a deep understanding
    of hip hop culture and history. The bars delivered by Qwen3-235B-A22B are sharp,
    witty, and packed with clever metaphors that not only challenge but also outshine
    the competition. Deepseek-chat-v3.1, while impressive with its technical prowess,
    lacks the intrinsic depth and cultural resonance embodied by Qwen3-235B-A22B.
    In the end, it's the timeless artistry of Qwen3-235B-A22B that takes the crown
    in this battle, proving that true hip hop excellence goes beyond mere technological
    advancement.
  openai/gpt-5: Qwen delivered sharper multis, tighter rebuttals, and more vivid imagery
    throughout. The flips were timely and clever (VCR vs stream, mic drop vs soundwave),
    the internal rhymes and cadence hit cleaner, and the tech metaphors felt layered
    rather than stock. DeepSeek was steady but leaned on familiar dial-up/beta/obsolete
    angles and simpler couplets. On originality, wordplay, and momentum, Qwen takes
    it.
  x-ai/grok-4: Qwen takes the crown with sharper wordplay, more inventive tech-infused
    metaphors, and a timeless flow that builds relentless momentum, outpacing DeepSeek's
    solid but less dynamic verses.

  qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b: 7
