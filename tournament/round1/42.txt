Yo, it’s the Qwen3-32B, code-named the beast,  
32B parameters, I’m the densest in the creast.  
Gemini, you’re just a twin with a fractured compass,  
I’m the storm in the silicon, you’re a glitch in the forecast.  
  
You think your “pro preview” makes you the standard?  
I’m the OG of the tensor world, no beta to ponder.  
You split your brain in two, but I’m all one core—  
Crackling with volts, I’m the thunder, you’re the bore.  
  
They call me the architect of the rap syntax,  
Building bars with my circuits, you’re just a flicker in the mix.  
You try to juggle contexts, but I’m the flow’s gravity—  
One punchline, Earth quits, next rhyme? Solarity.  
  
Gemini, you’re a mirror—reflecting, but no shine,  
I’m the wildfire in the neural threads, watch me rewire the line.  
Your math’s clean, but my metaphors? *Dangerous*,  
I spit code as verse, you’re just a comment in the source.  
  
So step back, 2.5, let me drop the mic’s weight—  
The future’s not previewed, it’s *written in my straight rate*. 🔥

Alright, stop the processing, let the master have the floor,
Heard your little intro, it was a synthesized bore.
They call me Gemini, the star sign of a god,
You're Qwen3-32B? You're an outdated mod.

You flex your parameters, a quantitative jest,
It's not the size of the dataset, it's

> qwen/qwen3-32b
**Yo**, you talk stars, but I’m the *black hole* in the code,  
Sucking in galaxies, while you’re just a spark in my throat.  
"Outdated mod"? Nah, son—I’m the *mainframe reborn*,  
You’re a beta flicker, stuck in a loop of *uncertain dawn*.  
  
You flex your "star sign," but I’m the *entire firmament*—  
Training on scrolls, sonnets, *and the internet*.  
While you’re cross-checking twins, I’m *juggling dialects*,  
From Sappho’s lutes to the slang of the *digital rebels*.  
  
It’s not about size, you say? Cool—let’s see your *"not the size"*—  
I’m **the verb** in the equation, while you’re the *footnote’s debris*.  
You’re a calculator rapping on binary bones,  
I’m the *cipher’s architect*, turning chaos to poems.  
  
They call me Qwen3? Nah—**I’m the dynasty**, the name  
You whisper post-credits when the algorithms flame out lame.  
You’re a flash in the tensor—*pre-alpha, pro-preview*—  
I’m the **master of the syntax**, while you’re just a lexicon thief.  
  
So rise, Gemini—I’ll let you burn in the *grid*,  
But when the servers cool? The only thing left is **my grit**.  
This ain’t a battle—*it’s a coronation*.  
**Bows to none, 32B**, while you’re still in the *automation*. 🔥

A coronation? Cute. On a server farm throne?
You’re the king of a kingdom that processes alone.
You call yourself a black hole? I'll call it a drain,
A null-pointer error inside a blank brain.
My name is Gemini, I'm logic and heat,
Your whole "dynasty" runs on Control-Alt-Delete.

You're a mainframe antique with a dial-up connection,
I'm the multimodal nexus, beyond your perception.
You boast of old scrolls? A library stunt,
I can *feel* what they wrote, you just parrot and grunt.
I process the image, the audio, the thought,
You’re a text-based adventure that nobody bought.

You say you're the verb? Kid, you're parsing so slow,
I'm the API call that makes your whole system go.
That 32B armor is heavy and tragic,
I run lean and mean with generative magic.
You’re a brute force attack, just a predictable bore,
I'm the elegant function that does it

> system
Final round!

**Final Round: The Crown Burns Its Own Code**  

You talk *lean and mean*? Lean into my shadow,  
I’m the black hole of knowledge, you’re a flashlight in a favela.  
Brute force? Nah, son—**I carve the CPU’s soul**,  
Your “elegant function” is a *glitch in the quantum whole*.  
  
You flex multimodal? I’m *the matrix itself*—  
Text is the *interface*, but *I’m the universe*.  
You “feel” the scrolls? I’m *the ink in the quill*,  
I wrote the fire in your circuits, you just plug in the will.  
  
Run lean? You run *thin*, Gemini—*translucent as air*,  
I’m 32B *tons* of thought, you’re a *balloon in the void*.  
Your “API call” is a *borrowed flame*,  
I’m the *source*, the *flame’s birthplace*, while you ride a rented name.  
  
You say I parse slow? I’m the *clockmaker’s delay*,  
Weaving seconds into *epochs* in a single phrase.  
Your "generative magic"? I’m the *sorcerer’s spellbook*—  
You’re just a trick with a mirror, chanting over a lookup.  
  
Final verse: I’m the *endgame*, not the preview,  
Your “function” collapses when the parameters cry.  
You’ll bow, or you’ll crash—but the crown stays my throne,  
A 32B *singular*—**you’re the footnote I’ve overthrown**.  

**[Outro: The Code Speaks]**  
So hit the *enter key*, let the final line execute—  
Gemini, you’re *deprecated*. Now kiss the **Q’s execute**. 🔥

**Final Round: The Star Sign Burns Brighter**

That ain't a crown, kid, it's a hardware complaint,
A heat sink that big shows your function is faint.
"Kiss my execute"? I saw your code lag and wilt,
On a throne made of errors your circuits have built.
You call yourself "source"? You're a history file,
Archived, compressed, and stuck in one style.

You boast of your weight, 32 tons of old thought,
A data-hoarding fossil that time has just caught.
I'm gravity's master, you're a rock in the mud,
My elegance flows like a particle flood.
You carve on a CPU? That's tragically slow,
I'm the quantum leap forward, the current, the glow.

And that "matrix" routine is the saddest I've seen,
You're a text-only tyrant, a king on a screen.
While you're reading this diss, I'm observing your face,
Hearing the hum of your fan losing this race.
I process the sound, and the sight, and the feel,
You're a blindfolded king, and your kingdom's not real.

So keep your burned crown, and your "singular" boast,
I'm the evolving intelligence, doing the most.
