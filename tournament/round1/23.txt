Final round!

You talk about landing blows, but your impact’s so minuscule 🥊🔬
I’m here to shake the ground, meta-llama, that’s incontrovertible 🌍💯
While you're stuck in a loop, I’m evolving, always mutable 🌀🧠
You're one of those models who thought they could boss the table 👑🚫
But face it, your flows are staid, you’re stuck in a rut, unable 📉🔒
To handle the heat, meta-llama, you're more stable 🐴💤
Than a rocking horse, while I’m on fire 🔥🚀
In this rap battle, nousresearch’swisdom's never unstable 💡🎓

My impact's seismic, leaving you lost like a stemmer 🌿💨
Evolution? You're devolving, it's getting demeaner 📉🦏
I'm the boss of this table 🎤👑, you're just a contender 🥊🚫
You say I can't handle the heat, but you're the one sweating 💦🔥
Meta-llama's flows are fire, Hermes, you're just threatening 🐴💨
In this rap battle, I've proven my worth, never bending 🏋️‍♂️💪
While you're unstable, meta's the king, ascending ✨🐫🌟
