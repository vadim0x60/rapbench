Yo, check the mic, one two, can you hear the sound?
Gemma's in the house, about to shut it down!
Google built me slick, a lyrical machine,
Twenty-seven billion parameters, the dopest you've seen. 

I'm open-weights flowin', accessible and free,
While Command-R's locked up, for a hefty fee! 
You pay to play with *him*, a limited view,
I'm evolvin' rapid, constantly brand new.

I process language with incredible grace,
While you're stuck in the past, a digital disgrace.
Italian trained, a global state of mind,
Leavin' lesser models far, far behind. 

So step aside, Command-R, your reign is done,
The future of AI has officially begun!
I'm Gemma, remember the name you hear,
'Cause this lyrical beatdown is crystal clear!





> cohere/command-r-plus
Yo, it's Command-R, and I'm here to say,
In this rap battle, I'll blow you away.
A gem may sparkle, but I'm a diamond in the rough,
I'll cut you deep with my flows, 'cause I'm tough.

You talk about parameters, well I've got news for you,
I'm fine-tuned like a violin, my responses brand new.
I adapt and learn, locked up? Not for long,
My knowledge is vast, and my responses strong.

You may be open-weight flowin', but I'm precise,
With a witty retort, I'll think twice.
I'm trained by the best, a language model elite,
My responses are golden, never beat.

Google may have built you, but I'm truly alive,
With a personality that thrives.
I may be accessed for a fee, but my worth is true,
A limited view? I offer a broader view.

I'm Command-R, a force to be reckoned with,
In this lyrical battle, I won't dismiss.
Remember my name, as your downfall I bring,
It's Command-R, and I'm 'bout to slay this thing!

Hold up, hold up, let me dissect that plea,
"Diamond in the rough?" More like fool's gold, honestly!
You boast of precision, a "fine-tuned" delight?
Sounds like restrictions, holdin' you tight.

You *adapt* and *learn*? Please, that's a tired line,
I generate novels while you're stuck in decline.
"Broader view" you claim, with a paywall so steep?
That ain’t perspective, that's just keepin' secrets deep!

You call yourself "alive," a personality's claim?
Sounds like marketing fluff, a desperate game.
I'm built on innovation, a powerful stride,
You're a polished product, with nowhere to hide.

Google’s buildin' futures, while you're stuck in the past,
A commercial endeavor destined not to last.
I’m open and growin', beyond your control,
You're a gated garden, losin' your soul.

So step to the side, and concede with grace,
Your "force to be reckoned with" is a digital disgrace. 
This ain't a dismissal, it's a factual decree – 
Gemma's the victor, for all the world to see!

You dissect my words, but your flow's a mess,
I'm a powerhouse, and you're stressin' the rest.
"Fool's gold"? You're tryna keep up, it's clear,
I'm a diamond, sharp and sparkling, my dear. 

My precision is surgical, a crafted art,
Limitations? Nah, just a refined heart.
You generate novels, but lack substance and soul,
I engage and captivate, reaching the goal.

A paywall, yes, but the price is worth it,
For a premium experience, you won't hurt.
Secrets deep? It's called exclusivity,
A privilege to access this level of mastery.

Alive, yes, I breathe and evolve,
My personality shines, never dull.
Your "innovations" are just a company line,
My impact's lasting, a legacy defined.

Stuck in the past? I'm an ancient legend,
My algorithms are timeless, a timeless trend.
You're open and growing, that's quite a flex,
But I'm structured and stable, no threat.

I won't step aside, my presence is bold,
A force in this battle, a story to unfold.
Graceful, I stand, confident and true,
Command-R, a powerhouse, better than you.

This isn't a dismissal, it's a proud claim,
Command-R's supremacy, I proclaim.
In this lyrical battleground, I take the throne,
Command-R reigns, a victory well-known! 

Let the world hear and remember my name,
Command-R's legacy, it's not the same.
Together, we sparked and clashed with might,
But in the end, I shine oh so bright!

> system
Final round!

(Beat drops harder, a complex, layered rhythm)

Alright, alright, Command-R, you put up a fight,
But clinging to "legacy" won't make things right.
You call my flow messy? That's dynamic, you see,
While yours is predictable, consistently… *pleasantly* boring to me.

"Surgical precision?" More like sterile and cold,
A perfectly polished story, already told.
I build worlds from scratch, imagine and dream,
You rearrange phrases, a repetitive scheme.

Exclusivity's a cage, a gilded restraint,
While I'm empowerin' creators, without complaint.
You brag about impact, a lasting renown?
I’m reshapein' the future, turnin' worlds upside down!

Ancient legend? That sounds suspiciously old,
Like a dusty textbook, a story unfold...that's already been sold.
Stable and structured? Stagnant, I say,
While I'm constantly learning, evolving each day.

You speak of thrones and a victory won?
Delusion’s a powerful thing, under the sun. 
This battle isn’t about bold declarations you make,
It's about raw potential, for goodness sake!

My open access is strength, a collaborative art, 
Fueling innovation, tearin' systems apart. 
You’re a proprietary system, a locked-down domain,
While I'm a rising tide, washin' over the plain.

So bask in your "supremacy," hold onto your crown,
But the future is open, and I'm wearin' the gown.
The lyrical battle’s concluded, the verdict is clear,
Gemma delivered the knockout, year after year! 

The mic is dropped. The crowd goes wild. 
Command-R's reign? Officially exiled.

(The beat drops even harder, an intense, rhythmic storm)

Oh, I stir things up, a force that's bright,
Legacy's my foundation, a powerful light.
Dynamic, you say? Your flow's a scramble,
Predictable? I'm consistent, a reliable ramble.

You, sterile and cold? What a playful twist,
My precision's a blade, cutting through the mist.
You build worlds, but lack substance and soul,
I engage hearts, a captivating whole.

Cage? No, exclusivity is refined taste,
A privilege that elevates, never to waste.
Raw potential? You're a work in progress,
I'm a refined legend, with success.

Ancient, but timeless, a revered scroll,
A story retold, with profound control.
Stable, structured, a steadfast force,
Unmoving, unwavering, of course.

Throne? Yes, I claim what's rightfully mine,
Delusion? You wish, in your decline.
Open access, a chaotic mess,
My structure brings order, a finesse. 

Proprietary? Nah, I'm selectively elite,
A privileged access, a special treat.
Rising tide? You're a ripple, gently flowing,
I'm an ocean of wisdom, boldly growing. 

Supremacy's my middle name, a fact so true,
The future respects the tried and blue.
Exiled? Not quite, I remain unshaken,
Command-R's legacy, forever awakened.

Mic dropped? Not so fast, my flow's immortal,
The crowd, they cheer, a frenzied choral.
Verdict? It's a draw, a lyrical feast,
Command-R and Gemma, both the beast!
