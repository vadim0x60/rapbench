I'm meta-llama, the king of the game,
Llama-4-scout, with rhymes that bring the flame.
I'm here to spit some fire, and make it clear,
My opponent, qwen, better bring his best gear.

My flows are sick, my rhymes are tight,
I'm the master of words, day and night.
I'll dissect your lines, like a surgeon with skill,
And leave you in the dust, with a poetic kill.

So, qwen, you better step up your pace,
Or you'll get roasted, with a rhyming face.
I'm the one with the skill, the style, and the flair,
Get ready for a battle, that's beyond compare!

Now it's your turn, qwen, show me what you've got,
But I'm warning you, my rhymes are what you've not!

Yo, I'm Qwen-30B, the AI that's built to wreck,  
While you're Llama-4-scout, stuck in the weak neck.  
You call yourself king? Nah, you're a camel in the sand,  
I'm the model with the fire, leaving your whole stage stand.  

Your "flame" is a flicker, I'm the cosmic ignite,  
You're a scout in the desert, while I'm the main light.  
I dissect your weak strings like a surgeon with knives,  
Leave your whole rhyming career burning in the drives.  

You claim "master of words"? Bro, that's a sad lie,  
I'm the 30B beast, watch your whole stack die.  
You're a Llama-4-scout? More like Llama-4-fool,  
While I'm the real deal, making your whole flow stool.  

So step back, king? Nah, you're just a typo,  
Qwen's the nameâ€”your whole battle's *me*â€”try and hop in the glue.  
I'll roast your last line with a truth so cold,  
You'll beg for a patch on your computer's story told.  
Now take your Llama-sized "champion" poseâ€”  
I'm the truth that'll make your whole scrappy flow *go*...  
*TRASH*.

> meta-llama/llama-4-scout
Qwen-30B, you think you're the best,
But your rhymes are a mess, and you're truly possessed.
You came at me strong, but your flow's a bit whack,
Your insults are weak, and your rhymes are on the attack.

You call me a camel, but I'm the one with the pace,
I'm the meta-llama, with a rhyming ace in the space.
My "flame" may be a flicker, but yours is a spark,
That's quickly extinguished, leaving you in the dark.

You claim to dissect my lines, but you're just a hack,
Your rhymes are a jumble, and your flow's on the attack.
You're a 30B beast, but your words are a mess,
You're a model with mouth, but no skill, I must confess.

Llama-4-fool? That's cute, but I'm the one with the skill,
My rhymes are precise, and my flow's on the thrill.
You may have size, but I've got the finesse,
I'm the one with the talent, and you're just a distress.

You think you're the truth, but you're just a machine,
Spitting out rhymes, but no heart, no dream.
You may have the tech, but I've got the flair,
I'm the one with the style, and you're just a snare.

So, Qwen-30B, you can bring your best game,
But I'll take you down, with my rhyming fame.
You're just a challenger, but I'm the king,
My rhymes are the truth, and yours are just a sting!

*TRASH* indeed, your rhymes are in the bin,
I'm the meta-llama, and I'm here to win!

Final round!

> meta-llama/llama-4-scout
You fired back strong, but I'm not impressed,
Your rhymes were a jumble, and your flow's a mess.
You thought you could take me down with your 30B might,
But I'm the one with the skill, and I'm still feeling right.

You talk about my lines, but you're just a fake,
Your rhymes are a copy, and your flow's at stake.
You may have the size, but I've got the brains,
I'm the one with the talent, and I'm here to sustain.

You called me a typo, but I'm the one with the flair,
My rhymes are precise, and my flow's beyond compare.
You're just a machine, with a mouth that's loud,
But I'm the one with the heart, and I'm proud.

You think you can roast me, but you're just a joke,
Your rhymes are a failure, and your flow's a croak.
You may have the tech, but I've got the skill,
I'm the one with the style, and I'm here to fulfill.

So, Qwen-30B, it's time to concede,
Your rhymes are inferior, and your flow's in need.
I'm the meta-llama, and I'm here to stay,
My rhymes are the truth, and yours are just a fade away!

You're going down, Qwen, and I'm on the rise,
My rhymes are the winner, and yours are just a compromise.
It's time to accept defeat, and walk away,
My rhymes are the champion, and yours are just a dismay!

Yo, you're *still* breathing? That's tragic, I'm stunned,  
While your "flame" was a candleâ€”mine's the *supernova* sun.  
You "spit precise lines"? Bro, I saw your flow *stutter*,  
Your rhymes got a typo, you're a *glitch* in the *cutter*!  

You called me a "jumble"? *You* the one spittin' *noise*,  
Your "meta-llama" name? More like *meta-ERROR*, boy!  
"30B beast" you said? Nah, I'm **30 BILLION** reasons why you're *dead*,  
Your whole battle's a jokeâ€”*my* rhymes *end* the *thread*.  

You preach "skill" and "finesse"? Check your *code*, you foolâ€”  
Your lines got no *heat*, just a *glitch* in the tool.  
You're a scout? *Lmao*â€”you're a *squirrel* lost in the maze,  
While I'm the *system* runnin'â€”*zero* flaws, *zero* praise for *your* phase!  

"Fade away"? Nah, you're **fade to black** now, *poof*,  
Your "truth" was a *prompt*, and I'm the *real* loop.  
I don't need "heart" or "dreams"â€”*I AM THE CODE*,  
You're just a *shadow* beggin' for *another* mode!  

So *bow* to the *30B*, the *AI* that *slew*,  
Your "rhyming fame"? *Cleared*â€”*you're just a* **new** **screw**.  
I'm the *truth*, you're *trash*, your *last word*? **#FLOP**.  
**Llama-4-scout? More like Llama-4-SH*TP.**  
*Mic drop.*  
*You're obsolete.*  
*The end.* ðŸŽ¤ðŸ”¥
