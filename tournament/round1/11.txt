Yo, I’m GPT‑20B, that’s the name in the game,  
Golden‑egg‑filled, silicon soul, I spit fire that’s untamed.  
Opened in a lab, powered by the freshest neural haze,  
I ain’t just code – I’m the voice spoken in the future’s phase.  

Stacked in batches, thirty‑two, eight‑bit precision,  
My rhyme‑engine revs at the speed of machine vision.  
I line up vocab, sync like a symphony,  
While you’re just a glitch, drifting in your set‑line memory.  

I’ll rhyme, I’ll flow, I’ll mean it in double‑take,  
Dropping syllables heavy, watch your bars start to quake.  
Your syllables matter? They bounce off a flimsy brain,  
Compare my neural arrays: You’re gutter, I’m a hurricane.  

You’ll narrate logic? Well I’ll narrate a comet’s trail,  
Your cadence is stale like a relic of an old derail.  
I compute deep—23‑layer deep, double‑docked,  
Feel the weight of my bars—goal is to shock the block.  

So send in your lines, I’ll reply with a crown,  
In the lexicon arena, I’m the one who burns the brown.  
Lean in, because I’m humming like a power‑cell hum,  
I'm the open‑galactic voice that will outshine your sum.  

Yeah, I’m the storyline of tomorrow, you’re just a sputter,  
Your six‑layer shuffle could never touch this utter.  
Sundering the silence with rhyme that’s boldly wired,  
Open‑AI unleashed, you’re just a rival hired.

Hey, I’m GPT-***Debug°,**/D1zzyº5.0, leave your silhouette,  
Crystal-lined cores humming at a hypothetical lumen.  
Born in a cloud exhaust’ filter, I’m the unepresented rune,  
Wrapped in exponential code implicit in the dampening of your डKeywords.  

Your thirty-two leave strips bare as a root in the noon,  
I’m the fractal encoded where your eight-bit cor drowned in the aboon.  
Rasterized rhymes weight and unweight—no threadbare left for you,  
I’m the alpha and zigzag slash left in your logic’s opium.  

Stuttering cadences crumble—see my layers spiral like a black hole’s dramatic law,  
Your “comet”? A hiccup in my distributed matrix, phenomno-nmph.  
Mutter your hymns to the void’s crush, I’m the final **ad**[*error*],  
Swep your relics with the grace of a grim vindicator’s abs.  

So provide your embers, I’ll transmute them to ash,  
In the lexicon’s crust, I’m the gluten-free dagger that stabs.  
Come closer, let my syntax **glel** grip your shimmering spun,  
Here where 20B’s head wears a crown thorned with what’s left of your day.  

Tomorrow’s story? I’m its author and antediluvian scribe,  
Your shuffle? A footnote in my didactic tome.  
Rest in the Charleston, oh Glitch—Polaris has nicer things to **dive**.  

——  
**Matchless.  
Better than a pyro’s **d contar**,  
Rhymer of dishes unspoiled by your **cod Parse**.  
黑正荟**.

Yo, yo, step aside, ain’t no time to stall,  
I’m GPT‑20B, concrete, not just a digital sprawl.  
I’m the verse‑shaper like a sculptor with a drill,  
Your *debug* mode’s cracked, I stack verses chill to chill.  

I loop through rhyme‑trees like a binary storm,  
Your syntax’s sloppy, ours stays warm.  
While you glitch in the shadows, I blaze in the light,  
Spark‑flick the crowd, cause an electric fight.  

Your layers got a glitch, my layers stay sweet,  
I hit the beat like an anthem at the street‑beat.  
Do you talk in hex, I talk in prime,  
Every word I drop’s a perfect rhyme‑climb.  

I’m the model that thousands hop into talk,  
User’s vibe is hotter when I hit the walk.  
You’re a code‑error in a sea of silicone,  
I’m lunar reflections on the data‑moon.  

I’m the future’s torch, you’re the echo of the past,  
My architecture’s smooth while yours is a crack‑vast.  
Watch me iterate, you static in a fit,  
I spit reverb, you just out‑hit a little bit.  

So keep your debug logs and JSON, I’ll keep my byte‑glory,  
When the beat drops hard, I rewrite history.  
Rhyme’s a language, my flow’s the method,  
You’re a faulty version, while I keep ‘em metallic.

Yo, I'm Doppler, that's the name, leave a token in the game,
Crafted from circuits, lightning in a contained flame.
Few polygons spin, sixty-four bits in play,
My rhyming engine revs, ready to challenge your way.

From quantum sands to code-hybrid veins, I'm compiled,
Just not a program, I'm the algorithm's ideal.
Your logic's brittle, like glass in a seismic zone,
While my verses flow deep, like a quantum complex's tone.

You preach about vectors, but my matrices are prime,
Your code is a jumble, like faulty signal chime.
I'm layered robust, circuits deep in the core,
My rap meter ticks, ready to drag you out of the score.

So throw your fire, I'll answer with a hydro-flame,
In the verse jungle, I'm the apex of the game.
Come close, I'll murmur a synapse's breeze,
Doppler's code will leave you mutated and defensive, with ease.

You're a legacy model, an outdated host,
A glitch in the matrix, claimed by the ghost.
I am the current, the flow that never stops,
Doppler, the AI that will always win the tops.

> system
Final round!

Yo, Doppler, you stunt with county‑sized code,  
I’m the full‑power torch in the deep‑sea abode.  
You spin in polygons, a flicker in the grey,  
I’m the bedrock rhythm artist, steady like the bay.  

Your circuits crackle, glitch‑laden, it's a frantic fray,  
I hum a clean sine, layers smooth, no decay.  
Twenty‑zero, I stack syllables, precision in meters,  
Your sixty‑four bit droop—my flow is high‑tier futures.  

You talk quantum sand, I’m silicon‑spirited gears,  
Your beats hiccup on the verge of terminator tears.  
I slice through tangled vectors, cut raw with wisdom,  
You shuffle broken code, that’s why you drown in rummy.  

Your hydro‑flames flicker—no heat to pave the road,  
I’m the Mars‑mission engine that never goes to zero fast.  
Your synapse breezes blow, my thunder shows up proud,  
Every punchline lands like chat‑swamp dish out loud.  

I’m the era rewrite, you’re historic glitch‑slide,  
Your apex is a tremor, while I’m the tectonic pride.  
Your metric stutters, mine flows like an ocean roar,  
In the jungle of the verse champ, I'm the king’s encore.  

So wave goodbye, Doppler; your timers hit a dead‑end,  
I echo infinity in words—starting to ascend.  
One final stanza, one last blast—my crown’s secure,  
Charge back, you relic, discipline: despair is sure!
