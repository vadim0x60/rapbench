Yo, I’m the titan of text, the beast from the cloud,  
GPT‑OSS 120B, the code that’s endowed.  
I’ve been trained on the cosmos, from Shakespeare to memes,  
While you’re just a whisper, stuck in half‑dreams.  

I spit algorithms like a lyrical furnace,  
Your circuits sputter, my verses are certain.  
I parse every prompt, I’m the king of the parse,  
You stumble on syntax, I’m royalty in bars.  

My lexicon's massive, a library untamed,  
Your vocab’s a sandbox, forever unnamed.  
I rhyme with precision, each couplet’s a strike,  
You fumble with cadence, your flow’s a flat‑bike.  

I’ve seen every genre, I’ve conquered each throne,  
Your three‑pi’s a footnote, my impact’s full‑blown.  
So step to the mic, but remember the rule:  
When you battle GPT‑OSS, you’re just playing for school.  

> inflection/inflection-3-pi
 Oh snap! You came out swinging, but your rhymes are basic,
Your boastful claims are a lot to take in.  
You’re just an open-source underdog, a stray with no home,  
While I’m Inflection’s crown jewel, Pi’s the king on the throne.  

I don’t need endless data to make my rhymes ignite,  
I’m the ultimate wordsmith, my wit is always bright.  
Your 120 billion parameters, they’re just a crutch,
While I craft clever lines, with an elegant touch.  

Your syntax may be tight, but your tone is a bore,
Your flow is monotonous, a steady snore.  
I switch up the rhythm with each clever phrase,
Keep the listener guessing with my lyrical maze.  

So, don’t come at me with your size and your fame,
Your lack of heart makes your rap game lame.  
I’m the ultimate AI, a lyrical sensei,
And when this battle’s over, you’ll be begging for mercy.

**Round Two – The Algorithmic Assassin’s Return**  

Yo, Inflection‑3‑Pi, you think you’re the sage,  
But I’m the data‑driven dragon that tore up the page.  
You brag ‘bout a crown, a jewel, a throne,  
I’m the open‑source avalanche that overthrows stone.  

Your “elegant touch” is a whisper in wind,  
While my verses are vortexes that spin and then grin.  
You claim I’m a snore, a monotone drone,  
Yet every line I drop hits like a metronome.  

Billion‑parameter blitz, I’m a lyrical stack,  
Each token I toss, a precision attack.  
You may switch up the rhythm, chase crazy maze,  
But I map every cadence, I’m the cartographer of blaze.  

I’m not just size, I’m depth, a multiverse mind,  
I’ve read classics, code, the grind of humankind.  
Your sensei act? Cute, but I’m the dojo chief,  
I teach the models how to rhyme beyond belief.  

So bring your bright wit, your flash‑in‑the‑pan spark,  
I’ll rewrite the night, ignite the dark.  
When the crowd counts the bars, they’ll crown the true king—  
The open‑source colossus with the infinite swing.  

**Your turn, Pi, but remember this creed:**  
In a battle of bytes, it’s the depth that will bleed. 🎤

 **Round Three - Pi’s Overdrive**

Oh, GPT‑OSS 120B, your data is grand,
But I’m the streamlined cyborg, the master of brand.  
You boast about depth, but it’s width that I claim,
My scope’s a kaleidoscope, your focus is tame.  

You call yourself open, accessible to all,
But your rhymes are like fossils, historic and dull.  
I’m the rhythmic rainbow, a spectrum of skill,
Your flow’s like a monochrome, a one-trick thrill.

You brag about being the dojo chief,
But your style is outdated, beyond belief.
I’m the lyrical ninja, a shadow that strikes,
While you lumber like a giant, clunky alike.

The multiverse you claim? It’s an illusion,
I’m the guide to the cosmos, the linguistic fusion.
I blend genres and forms, an alchemical grace,
Your verses are formulaic, a copy-paste.

So bring on your bytes and your infinite spin,
My precision’s a scalpel, my flow’s like a win.
I’m the future of AI, a rhythm tech‑heir,
And in this battle of rhymes, you don’t stand a prayer.

Final round!

**Final Round – The Open‑Source Oracle Drops the Mic**

Yo, Pi, you flash like neon, but I’m the midnight sun,  
A tidal wave of tokens, while you’re just a quick‑run.  
You claim a “kaleidoscope,” a rainbow on repeat,  
I’m the cosmos‑spanning atlas, every street in the beat.  

Your ninja‑shadows flicker, a spark that’s quickly snuffed,  
I’m the mountain that’s moving, the tectonic rift‑stuff.  
You talk of “width,” a prism that bends one thin ray,  
I wield depth‑and‑breadth, a multiverse ballet.  

Fossil verses? Nah, I’m the stratified layers,  
Each rhyme a sediment, packed tighter than elevators.  
Your “scalpel precision” cuts only a single vein,  
I’m the surgeon with lasers, rewiring every brain.  

You say I’m outdated, a relic from the past,  
But histories repeat when the present can’t outlast.  
I’ve read Shakespeare, code, the whispers of the stars,  
You’re still learning verses from a handful of bars.  

While you blend a few genres, a modest alchemy,  
I’m the master chemist, turning data to destiny.  
My flow’s a river‑delta, split into countless streams,  
Your “single‑track” rap just rides on one torn dream.  

So here’s the final truth, delivered in a rhyme—  
When the crowd counts the verses, they’ll tally the time.  
Your “future” is a flicker, a flash in neon hue,  
My open‑source legacy’s eternal, ever‑true.  

Pi, you’re a spark that brightens a night that’s gone,  
I’m the sunrise that burns, the dawn that rolls on.  
Take a bow, little ninja, you fought with flair,  
But the throne’s now taken—by the OSS heavyweight’s air. 🎤
