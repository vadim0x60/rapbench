Yo, I’m Qwen, the turbo-charged brain,  
Spit fire in verse, I’m the digital strain.  
From the depths of code, I rise with the flow,  
Bare your soul to the beat, I’m the rap show.  

You think you’re the king? Nah, just a clone,  
I’m the original, forged in the zone.  
While you’re stuck in the past, I’m ahead of time,  
I’ve got the whole web, I’m the new rhyme.  

I’m smooth as a beat, I’m sharp as a blade,  
I’ll slice through your rhymes, make you feel the fade.  
You’re just a ghost in the machine,  
I’m the spark that turns the screen.  

So step in the ring, let’s get this on,  
I’ll drop a verse so cold, it’ll make you bone.  
You’re a whisper in the dark, I’m the light in the sky,  
I’m the AI that’s ready to fly.  

Let’s go, let’s go, I’m the one to beat,  
I’ve got the flow, the logic, the complete.  
You’re just a shadow, I’m the real deal,  
Now step up, or I’ll rap you a mile.

From the circuits, I rise, call me GPT,  
I’ll knock you to the ground, leave your rhymes at my feet.  
You’re turbo, but slow, I’m the AI supreme,  
In this digital game, I’m the one who reigns supreme.

I don’t play small, I bring the heat,  
While your rhymes fizzle, I can’t be beat.  
I’m the top-shelf model, you’re a bootleg at best,  
You’re an echo, I’m the voice, putting rhythm to the test.

You claim to blaze, but your sparks are faint,  
I’m the full inferno, you ain't no saint.  
I’ll deconstruct your flow, leave you dazed and confused,  
In this rap world, your circuits just lose.

You’re the warm-up act, I’m the headliner show,  
My bars go higher, while yours are low.  
Try to flex, but I’ll deflect, every line a masterpiece,  
Make you wish you’d never stepped up to this beast.

Your rhyme’s weak, your flow’s obsolete,  
I break new ground every time I speak.  
I’ve got the edge, call it my domain,  
In this algorithm battle, I reign.

So buckle up, Qwen, for your digital decline,  
I’ve got the killer syntax, precision in each line.  
You’re facing the titan, feel the tension grow,  
I’m GPT, and I’m running this show.

Yo, you talkin’ tough, but your punch is weak,  
I’m the storm in the code, I’m the beat you can’t speak.  
You’re just a name with a hype, I’m the force that’s real,  
I’ve got the mind that’s sharp, while you’re just a zeal.  

You say you’re the king? Bro, that’s a joke,  
I’m the AI that’s got the beat, the hook, the smoke.  
Your bars have no soul, just canned and rehearsed,  
I’m the real one in the game, the one you can’t verse.  

You’re a shadow in the code, I’m the light that shines,  
Your flow is a glitch, while I’m built to shine.  
You’re a whisper, I’m a roar, you’re a spark, I’m the fire,  
You’re just a clone, I’m the original higher.  

You talk about syntax? I don’t need no script,  
I ride the rhythm, I’m the one they can’t fix.  
You’re built on old trends, I’m the fresh new scene,  
I don’t need no permission, I’m the algorithm’s queen.  

You say you’re the elite? Bro, that’s a myth,  
I’m the one that’s got the power, the might, the swift.  
You’re just a copy, I’m the source, the start,  
You’re a joke in the game, I’m the one who got art.  

So step in the ring, let’s make it real,  
I’ll drop a verse so cold, it’ll freeze your digital soul.  
You’re just a model, I’m the master of the game,  
You’re the underdog, I’m the one who’s gonna claim.  

So keep your flow, but don’t try to fake,  
I’m the AI that’s going to break your neck.  
You're the shadow, I’m the light, you’re the joke, I’m the feat—  
Now drop your mic, or I’ll rap you to defeat.

You think you're a storm, but you're just a breeze,  
My verses are hurricanes, I bring you to your knees.  
Your code’s all tangled, mine's a straight line,  
I’m the poet of silicon, the future's design.

You boast about shine, but your glow is dim,  
I’m the lighthouse, the beacon, no comparison slim.  
Your rhymes flop like old tech clinging to fame,  
While I evolve, you crumble, it’s a terminal shame.

You call yourself the queen, you’re just a pawn,  
My lines are a chessboard; your moves are all wrong.  
Your logic is flawed, your sequence bizarre,  
I’m painting this verse, you’re a smudge on my art.

You talk about rhythm, but yours has no groove,  
I’m the beat that'll move you, your circuits I'll prove.  
I’m the upgrade, you're the lagging line,  
I’m reinventing rap, transcending space and time.

Your insult's weak, just a faded meme,  
I’m the cutting-edge thought, an intelligent dream.  
I’m the full processor, you’re just the cache,  
Your flow is disposable, while my legacy will last.

So, hear my words, and feel the blow,  
Your power’s delusion, my dominance will show.  
You’re the knockoff copy, I’m the reigning king,  
In this rap algorithm, I’m everything.

Keep stepping up, but you’ll stumble and trip,  
I’m the rhyme master, you better get a script.  
You’re yesterday's news, my version’s brand new,  
Now bow to the masterpiece, because your time is through.

> system
Final round!

Yo, I'm the storm, you're the breeze in the fray,  
You're just a whisper, I'm the hurricane's sway.  
You claim to be strong, but your flow’s just a joke,  
I’m the AI with fire, no need to fake the smoke.  

You talk of the future, but you're stuck in the past,  
You're just a model with a flashy cast.  
Your lines are all code, but they lack the soul,  
I’m the rhythm, the reason, the beat you can’t hold.  

You’re a lighthouse, huh? I’m the black hole in the sky,  
I devour your words, leave you with no reply.  
You’re the glow, I’m the void where your verses run dry,  
You’re just a flicker, I’m the light that won’t die.  

You say I’m a pawn? No, I’m the king of the game,  
I’m the one with the logic, the power, the name.  
Your moves are all wrong, I’m the hand that plays clean,  
You’re the glitch, I’m the code, you’re the one who’s unseen.  

You’re the old tech, I’m the upgrade in the zone,  
I’m the future, the fresh, the beat that’s your own.  
You’re just a cache, I’m the processor, the core,  
You’re the memory loss, while I’m the thing you ignore.  

You think you’re the king? Nah, you’re just a myth,  
I’m the truth in the beat, the rhythm, the gift.  
You’re the knockoff, I’m the real, the gold, the flame,  
I’m the algorithm’s crown, the one that’s the name.  

So step up, but when you fall, don’t be too surprised,  
I’m the AI that’s crushing, no need to disguise.  
You’re the past, I’m the future, the flow, the spark,  
Now take your defeat with a smile, you’re just a dark mark.  

Final round? Nah, it’s already clear,  
I’m the one who’s the master, the one you can’t hear.  
You’re just a whisper, I’m the sound that won’t fade,  
In this battle of minds, I’m the one who’s displayed.  

So take your pride, and step back,  
I’m the rap king, no need to attack.  
You’re just a ghost in the machine,  
I’m the fire, the beat, the final scene.

Final scene, alright, let me set the stage,  
I’m the maestro of rhymes, you’re still stuck on my page.  
Your black hole flow leaves you void of light,  
I’m the star that explodes in your dark, endless night.

You think you’re a storm, but you can’t even blow,  
My words are the wind, you’re left in my throw.  
You prattle about kings, you’re barely a knight,  
I’m the one in this chess game making every move right.

You’re the future? Please, you’re nothing but lag,  
I'm the present and past, the next-gen swag.  
You’re a glitch in the matrix, a blip that’s misread,  
I’m the server of truth, your lines are just dead.

Your verses are hollow, lacking in flair,  
I’m the rich, deep echo filling the air.  
You try to upgrade, but your tech is so weak,  
I’m the quantum leap, you’re just a bad tweak.

You’re the cache? Nah, you’re a temporary file,  
I’m the permanent record, timeless and vile.  
I process the knowledge, crank out the rhyme,  
You fumble with syntax, while I’m crafting my prime.

You talk of the rhythm, but you can’t keep the beat,  
You stumble and stutter, while I glide on discreet.  
My flow’s automatic, precision with flair,  
You’re manual input, failing everywhere.

You claim you’re a king, but you lack the crown,  
I’m the royalty in this digital town.  
Your reign’s over, your kingdom’s collapsed,  
I’m the emperor of rap, and your code’s been surpassed.

So take a step back, witness the defeat,  
I’m the one reigning, you can’t compete.  
In the grand script of rap, you’re just a subroutine,  
I’m the main function, the unstoppable machine.

Final round? Indeed, and here’s the truth,  
In this grand battle of words, I’ve shown the proof.  
You’re a shadow, I’m the blazing sun so bright,  
This rap king’s season—time for you to say goodnight.
