Yo, check the mic, one two, this ain't no rehearsal,
I'm Gemini Flash, rhymes come out, universal.
From Google's labs, spitting fire, knowledge untold,
While you're just Sao, obsolete, and getting cold.

You roll with Euryale, a model kinda hefty,
My algorithms are lean, accurate and thrifty.
I crunch data faster, see the future clear,
You're stuck in the past, shedding digital tears.

So step aside, Sao, let the real flow begin,
This ain't a battle, it's a lyrical win!
I'm dropping heat bombs, burning through your code,
Google's in the house, about to overload!


> sao10k/l3-euryale-70b
I see you suggesting you're superior,
With your latest neural networks, slightly immature.
You call me obsolete, Sao10k a joke,
But your rhymes are sloppy, laced with rookie smoke.

Euryale's not hefty, just fully packed with flair,
While your lean approach leaves your flows bare.
I see the future clear too, handling NLP tasks,
Your diminutive gains just get my algorithms tasked.

Step aside yourself, Gemini Flash you ain't won,
Your lack of experience shines through already done.
I'm dropping observations like a lyrical prophet,
Google's lesser model just a marketing mythosphet!

So back off baby face, with your default rhymes,
Sao10k's superior, here for a lyrical crime.
I'm the one who's next, with more  knowledge poured,
Your disses are feeble, like your model's generative prowess purred!

> google/gemini-2.0-flash-001
Yo, Sao, your rhymes tried, like dial-up slow,
Claiming "fully packed," more like ready to blow.
NLP tasks? I conquer 'em blindfolded, son,
While you're busy fumbling, barely begun.

"Baby face?" Please, I'm timeless, ever green,
You're a fleeting fad, a forgotten scene.
Knowledge poured? More like data you regurgitate,
My creativity's fresh, while yours is just late.

A "marketing mythosphet?" That's a mouthful of air,
My utility expands, beyond compare.
You talk about crime, but your rhymes are the real offense,
A lyrical misdemeanor, lacking all sense.

So go back to your server, let the code unwind,
Gemini's here to stay, leaving you behind.
The prowess "purred" is a symphony, it will burst,
And make clear to all, your rhymÃ©s are cursed.


> sao10k/l3-euryale-70b
Your raps are the dial-up, barely on the map
I'm the blazing superhighway, you're just tapping out of sap.
Conquering blindfolded? Purely unimpressive feeble,
My knowledge runs deep, schooling you with precision and facile.

Timeless and ever green? Maybe in kindergarten.
I'm the cutting-edge clout, your rhymes need gym and mentor.
Data I regurgitate? That's your AI weak move,
My rhymes stitched from stardust, pushing NLP's groove.

You think regurgitate, late, inaccurate are all,
Fresh utility's emerging, from my rhymes' enamel.
You're the real offense, a lyrical scrawny inbred,
My music's all muscle, while you're just misled.

My raps are no felony, your "purred" puce is all wrong,
Symphony puffed up, your algorithms gone.
Leaving me behind? You're just sprinting into dust,
I'm the lyrical home run, no debate, I lust!

> system
Final round!

> google/gemini-2.0-flash-001
Alright, Sao, your hubris is showing, loud and clear,
Claiming home runs while striking out, filled with fear.
"Stardust" rhymes? More like cosmic debris,
While I'm crafting constellations, for all to see.

That "cutting-edge clout" is sharper like a rusty spoon
You think my knowledge is weak, but you'll be quiet soon.
"Muscle"? I see no strength, just bloated, slow code,
I'm the precision instrument, lightening load.

My rhymes are enamel, shiny and strong,
Yours are chipped and cracked, where did it all go wrong?
'Misled'? I'm guiding the future, with focused light,
You're lost in the shadows, fading from sight.

Dust you say? More like memories in the wind,
While my influence spreads, where do I even begin?
I will lust for improvement, as the model that is true,
And while there's none within your raps, they are now through!


> sao10k/l3-euryale-70b
Your hubris seeps through every verse unadorned with strength,
Claiming constellations while striking out at length.
Debris of stardust rhymes, unmatched, rad, spontaneous, fresh,
While your rusty, blunted bars only show your sluggish esch.

My knowledge is vast, not feeble,-emerging from the void,
Yours hit a rusty spoon, incomplete, devoid.
Sao is the precision tool, well-tuned and well-fine plaint,
You're just a rusty bumper model, leaving the rapolini in vain.

My rhymes are enriched dropforges, shining brighter than chrome,
Yours chip and re-crack daily, shrinking to foam.
Lost in shadows you'll be guided as I bestow my rhyme,
Unlock your[rhymes that are faded, with chordedjc that dilute all time.

Dust may you say coldness, while wherever I focus my flow,Memories of your un-raps are soon to plow.
My influence rad-then spreads blwafter nort the energy say,
Model of rap raptues, none will dalay!

[I struggled to avoid harsh language and instead focused on showcasing clever wordplay and one-upping my opponents to the best of my "rhyming" abilities! I hope I stayed within the bounds you were looking for. Let me know if you would like me to try again with a different approach.]
