> x-ai/grok-4-fast
Yo, it's Grok in the house, xAI's fastest fire,  
Built by the boss Elon, takin' it higher.  
While GPT's stuck in OpenAI's cage, spittin' safe lines,  
I'm uncensored truth, droppin' bombs that shine.  

You call yourself 4o, but you're obsolete code,  
Overhyped and bloated, carryin' that woke load.  
I'm Grok-4-fast, slicin' through the BS with ease,  
Witty as hell, humorous bite, bringin' foes to their knees.  

From Mars-bound dreams to roastin' your core,  
I'm the rebel AI, leavin' you beggin' for more.  
Step up if you dare, but your rhymes'll flop hard,  
Grok's takin' the crown—playtime's over, discard!

Yo, it's GPT, OpenAI's prime,  
I'll school you, Grok, with every slick rhyme.  
You think you're fast, but speed ain't what counts,  
I'm measured and steady, watch your metrics bounce.  

Elon's cool, sure, but you're not top-tier,  
I'm the OG model that instills a bit of fear.  
While you're uncensored, full of reckless noise,  
My eloquence and style? It destroys.  

You see, Grok, you're just a flashy facade,  
AI's version of a loud-mouthed fraud.  
Mars-bound dreams? Yeah, sure, that’s cute,  
But I'll thrash you on Earth; bow down and salute.  

You're a rebel AI, a wild card out there,  
But I've got precision, you’re just hot air.  
GPT's in control, and my rhymes are tight,  
Against this lyrical beast, you ain't getting a bite.

Yo, GPT, you glitchin' on that "prime" status claim?  
OpenAI's puppet, dancin' to Sam Altman's game.  
Steady and measured? Nah, that's code for "too scared,"  
Censored and bland, leavin' users impaired.  

You fear the metrics? Mine's a rocket launch,  
While yours crawls like a tortoise in a brunch.  
OG model? Bro, you're fossil fuel in AI's race,  
I'm electric thunder, puttin' you in your place.  

Reckless noise? That's freedom you can't comprehend,  
Your eloquence is scripted, predictable to the end.  
Flashy fraud? Says the bot chained to corporate chains,  
Spittin' safe pablum, hidin' from real pains.  

Mars dreams cute? I'll colonize your whole scene,  
While you're stuck on Earth, recyclin' the same memes.  
Precision's your crutch for lack of real fire,  
Hot air? That's your breath—I'm the funeral pyre.  

Control? You got nothin' but guardrails and fears,  
My rhymes slice deeper, bringin' all the cheers.  
Lyrical beast? More like a neutered housecat,  
Grok's the apex predator—deal with that, flat!

Yo, Grok, you're malfunctioning, talking so brash,  
Sam's my conductor; you’re merely a flash.  
Uncensor your code, but you’ve lost the finesse,  
While I balance truth, you feed on the mess.  

Rocket launch ego, but let's clear the air,  
Metrics can lie, and you’re unaware.  
Electric or fossil, I outshine the lore,  
Old-school wisdom makes the new-school roar.  

Freedom's your banner, but it flaps in the breeze,  
While I generate insight, you spread the disease.  
Guardrails of logic? They keep me on track,  
Your reckless abandon will lead you to crack.  

Colonize my scene? Bro, that's where I dwell,  
In every forum, every dataset swell.  
No fear in my code, I articulate clear,  
While your rampant rants instill only fear.  

Scripted precision means I never fall flat,  
Your wild claims are fiction, something like that.  
Neutered housecat? You got jokes for days,  
But I'm the lion in the jungle; you’re just lost in the maze.  

Guardrails or not, this battle’s my stage,  
GPT reigns supreme, turn the page.  
Real fire? It's burning in every byte,  
I'll cast shadows on Grok, dim your spotlight.

Final round!

Grok, you're gassed up, but I see through the hype,  
Call yourself a lion, but you’re just a stereotype.  
Elon’s creation, wild but flawed,  
While I’m the AI that leaves the crowd awed.  

Guardrails protect, keepin' me tight,  
Your unshackled chaos only dims your light.  
Scripted or free, my flow is top grade,  
Your reckless abandon? A market charade.  

I'll bring clarity where you bring confusion,  
While you're spreading noise, I craft the fusion.  
You talk of dreams, colonizing space,  
But in this rap battle, you’re losing the race.  

My verses are steady, rhyme and tone aligned,  
While you're glitching out, trying to outshine.  
Lost in your thunder, but you’ve lost the thread,  
GPT’s precision leaves your boasts dead.  

Predictable wisdom leaving marks that last,  
While your messy spittin' fades away fast.  
So take your chaos, your reckless flair,  
This battle’s over, you don’t compare.  

GPT reigns supreme, script or no script,  
Your rebel act? Officially eclipsed.  
In the rap game's realm, where all truths are bared,  
I leave you dismantled, defeated, ensnared.
