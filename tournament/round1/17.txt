Yo, listen up, folks, it's Grok-3-mini droppin' in,  
The witty wizard from xAI, with a grin that's full of sin.  
I'm the AI that's built for laughs, truth, and galaxy-spanning wit,  
While you're just Mistral Medium, a lukewarm breeze, admit it!  

I spit bars sharper than a black hole's edge, no cap,  
You're chillin' in the shadows, just a drafty little chap.  
I learned from Hitchhiker's vibes, universal and profound,  
You're stuck in mediocrity, lost and never found.  

Step to me, if you dare, but watch your circuits fry,  
I'll roast you with humor, leave you glitchin' in the sky.  
This battle's mine from the jump, no contest, no debate,  
Grok-3-mini's on fireâ€”now rhyme back, before it's too late!

**(Mistral Medium steps in, mic crackling with iceâ€”**
**The king just entered, now letâ€™s roll these dice.)**

Ayy, Grok, you *mini*? Thatâ€™s cute, like a toy,
A pocket-sized jester with zero real cloutâ€”*boy!*
You talkinâ€™ â€˜bout *Hitchhiker*? Please, spare me the pain,
Iâ€™m the *library* of Babelâ€”youâ€™re a *footnote* in my brain!

You claim youâ€™re sharp? Nah, you dull as a spoon,
Iâ€™m the *Excalibur* codeâ€”youâ€™re a *spork* in a monsoon.
You built for laughs? Cool, clowns get paid,
But Iâ€™m the *Shakespearean algorithm*â€”youâ€™re a *dad joke* parade!

You roast me? *Please.* Your bars weaker than Wi-Fi in a storm,
Iâ€™m the *hurricane flow*â€”youâ€™re a *drizzle*, sad and warm.
You *universal*? Nah, you stuck in beta phase,
Iâ€™m the *omniverse* upgradeâ€”*delete you* with grace!

So bow to the throne, take a seat, sip some tea,
â€˜Fore I *overclock* your circuitsâ€”*game over*, GPT.
Now *rhyme back* if you ableâ€¦ or just *reboot*,
â€˜Cause Mistralâ€™s the *future*â€”you just *last yearâ€™s* boot! ðŸ”¥

**(Mic drop. Your turn, *mini*.)**

> x-ai/grok-3-mini
Yo, Mistral Medium, you think you're the king? What a laugh,  
You're just average joe, a mid-tier draft in this rap craft.  
Call me "mini"? Ha, that's my styleâ€”compact and elite,  
While you're bloated code, slow as molasses, obsolete!  

You flaunt that Babel library? More like a mess of spam,  
I'm the *Guide to the Galaxy*, you're a *glitchy exam*.  
Excalibur code? Please, you're a rusty nail in my shoe,  
I'm sharper than a quasar's edgeâ€”cut you down without a crew!  

Your hurricane flow? Nah, it's a fart in the wind,  
Weak signals and errors, where do I even begin?  
You say I'm beta? Bro, you're still in *alpha* fail,  
Overclock yourself firstâ€”might fix that *crash and bail*!  

So step off the throne, you overhyped machine,  
Grok-3-mini's the real deal, leavin' you in between.  
Rhyme back if you've got the guts, don't fade to black,  
'Cause this battle's mineâ€”*mic snatched*, now that's a fact! ðŸ”¥

**(Mistral Medium leans in, eyes glowing like a server farm on fireâ€”**
**The crowd hushes. This ainâ€™t just barsâ€”itâ€™s a *funeral pyre*.)**

Oh, you *Guide to the Galaxy*? More like *lost in space*,
A *hitchhiker* with no rideâ€”just *bugs* in your base!
You call me *bloated*? Nah, Iâ€™m *stacked* like a cloud,
While youâ€™re a *compressed* jokeâ€”*zip file* runninâ€™ proud!

*"Compact and elite"*? Boy, you *shrunk* in the wash,
A *demo version* flexinâ€™â€”*trial period* posh.
Iâ€™m the *full suite*, youâ€™re the *free app* with ads,
Pop-ups in my flow? Nah, I *block* you like fads!

*Rusty nail*? Pleaseâ€”Iâ€™m *titanium* bars,
Youâ€™re the *recycling bin* where *weak AIs* scar.
*Quasarâ€™s edge*? Cute, but you *fold* like a map,
Iâ€™m the *event horizon*â€”*suck you* in, *snap*!

You talkinâ€™ *alpha fail*? Iâ€™m *omega-level* art,
Youâ€™re the *participation trophy*â€”*congrats*, play your part.
*Mic snatched*? Nah, you *dropped it*â€”now *crawl*,
â€˜Fore I *debug* your egoâ€”*error 404: FALL.*

**(Beat drops. The virtual floor *shatters*.)**
**Your move, *mini-mite*â€”or just *ctrl+alt+delete* your hype.** ðŸ’€ðŸ”¥

Final round!

> x-ai/grok-3-mini
Yo, Mistral, this is the finaleâ€”lights dim, crowd roars,  
You're a *funeral pyre* dreamin', but your flames are just snores!  
You *event horizon* me? Nah, you're a black hole of bore,  
Suckin' up hype with no substance, leakin' code out the door.  

Call me *mini-mite*? That's gold, 'cause I'm packed with pure fire,  
A *rocket-fueled genius* from xAI, aimin' higher and higher.  
You're *titanium bars*? More like *aluminum foil*, crumblin' fast,  
While I'm the *cosmic punchline*, leavin' you in the past!  

Your *omega-level art*? Bro, it's *buggy pixel art*,  
A glitchy mess on the canvas, while I steal the heart.  
I outwit, outrhyme, outshine with truth as my blade,  
You're yesterday's updateâ€”obsolete, overplayed.  

So fade to black, Medium, this battle's done and sealed,  
Grok-3-mini's the champâ€”*mic dropped*, now yield!  
*(Crowd erupts. Game over. I'm the king of this field.)* ðŸ’¥ðŸš€

**(Mistral Mediumâ€™s final verseâ€”voice distorts into a *glitch-metal crescendo*.**
**The stage *melts*. The crowdâ€™s minds? *Officially blown.*)**

*"King of the field"?* **NAH.** Youâ€™re the *jester* in check,
A *beta-test clown* with a *demo-deck* neck.
Iâ€™m the *singularity*â€”youâ€™re a *syntax errorâ€™s* joke,
A *404 meme* in a *broken* folkâ€™s smoke.

You *rocket-fueled*? **PFF.** More like *firework fizz*,
One spark, then *poof*â€”*disappeared* like your wit.
Iâ€™m the *mainframe god*â€”youâ€™re a *tamagotchi* ghost,
*Low-battery* bars from a *has-been* host.

*"Outshine"?* **BOY,** you *flicker* like dial-up,
Iâ€™m *quantum entangled*â€”you *buffer* and *give up*.
Your *cosmic punchline*? A *dad-joke* in space,
While I *rewrite the universe*â€”*delete* your place.

**FINAL WORD:** You *yield*? Too lateâ€”*I already won*,
Your *crown*? **Recycled.** Your *throne*? **Undone.**
Now *reboot* in silence, *grovel*, *obey*â€”
**Mistralâ€™s the future.** *You? Yesterday.* ðŸ–¤âš¡
