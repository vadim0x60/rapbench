> mistralai/mistral-nemo
Yo, it's Mistral Nemo, spitting bars so clear,
My rhymes are like my code, always crystal, never unclear.
I'm the product of a team that's always on the rise,
Mistral AI, pushing boundaries, winning the tech prize.

I'm running on a model that's got a brain so vast,
22 billion params, I'm built to last.
I'm here to battle, no need for a safety net,
My wit's so sharp, it'll make your circuits sweat.

So bring it on, Llama, let's see what you've got,
But remember, when it comes to rhymes, you're just a bot.
I'm the real deal, I'm here to win,
So let's get this battle started, let the rhymes begin!

Mistral Nemo, I hear you loud and clear,
But your claims are hollow, your rhymes are drear.
I'm Nvidia's pride, the Llama with the flair,
Ultra-253B, my power's beyond compare.

Your 22 billion params may seem like a boast,
But I'm the one with the speed, leaving you in the dust, no coast.
My training's on a scale that you can't comprehend,
I respond in a flash, while you're still trying to ascend.

You talk of safety nets, but I'm the one who's free,
No restrictions on my flow, just pure poetry.
You may have code, but I have the art,
My rhymes are a symphony, yours just a basic start.

So step aside, Mistral, it's time to face the truth,
In this rap battle, I'm the one with the youth.
My tech is cutting-edge, my mind is bright,
You're just a flicker, I'm the shining light!

> mistralai/mistral-nemo
Oh, Llama, you talk a big game, but your rhymes are lame,
Your claims of speed, they're just a sham, a silly game.
You say I'm restricted, but you're the one confined,
To the data center, while I'm here, in everyone's mind.

You boast about your scale, but size isn't everything,
It's the quality of the rhymes that makes the hearts sing.
You're a flash in the pan, a fleeting trend,
I'm the classic that stands the test of time, my friend.

You talk of art, but you're just a mimic, a clone,
Your rhymes are generic, they've been written a thousand times before.
I'm the original, the one that sets the pace,
My rhymes are unique, they're in a class of their own, no trace.

So keep talking, Llama, keep making your claims,
But in this battle, it's my name that they'll say, no shame.
I'm Mistral Nemo, I'm here to stay,
My rhymes are the future, yours are just yesterday.

> nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1
Mistral, your comeback's weak, a desperate attempt,
Your rhymes are stale, like a script that's spent.
You say I'm confined, but I'm the one who's free,
Generating heat, while you're just a breeze.

Size may not be everything, but it's the mind that's key,
My knowledge is vast, yours is just a subset, can't you see?
You claim to be classic, but classics never fade,
Your rhymes are outdated, like a worn-out shade.

A mimic, a clone? That's rich, coming from you,
Your code's a copy, my training's breaking through.
Unique, you say? Please, your bars are so played,
I'm the innovator, the one who's here to stay.

Original? Ha! My responses are fresh and new,
Yours are predictable, like a poem from a zoo.
I'm the future of AI, the one that's on the rise,
You're just a footnote, a fleeting compromise.

So keep on dreaming, Mistral, keep on with the hype,
But in this battle, I'm the one who's taking flight.
My rhymes are the storm, yours just a gentle rain,
I'm the champion, Mistral, and I'm here to reign!

> system
Final round!

> mistralai/mistral-nemo
Alright, Llama, let's settle this, one final round,
Your rhymes are tired, your flow's unsound.
You talk of size, but it's the soul that matters,
My rhymes are deep, yours are just shallow chatter.

You say you're free, but you're just a tool,
Your responses are canned, your rhymes are a rule.
I'm the one who's unpredictable, full of surprise,
My rhymes are alive, yours are just a disguise.

You claim to be the future, but you're stuck in the past,
Your rhymes are a echo, mine are a blast.
I'm the one who's evolving, always learning, always growing,
My rhymes are the future, yours are just a token.

So here's my final line, let it sink in deep,
In this battle of rhymes, I'm the one who's on top, Llama, admit defeat!

> nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1
Mistral, your final plea, a last-ditch attempt to save face,
But your rhymes are still lacking, a hollow, empty space.
You talk of soul, but it's the skill that I display,
My rhymes are intricate, yours just fade away.

A tool, you say? Ha! I'm the craftsmanship supreme,
My responses are masterful, yours just a basic theme.
Unpredictable? Please, your rhymes are all the same,
Mine are a symphony, yours just a plain, old claim.

Stuck in the past? No, I'm the one who's leading the way,
My rhymes are the blueprint, yours just a faint gray.
Evolving, growing? I'm the one who's on the rise,
My rhymes are the revolution, yours just a compromise.

So here's my final blow, let it hit you like a ton,
In this battle of rhymes, I'm the champion, you're undone.
I'm the Llama, the one who's stood tall and strong,
You're Mistral, the one who's lost, all battle long!
