closing_statements:
  deepseek/deepseek-chat: "Mic drop\u2014the room becomes a block matrix."
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: This was a clash of titans, a battle of fundamentally different
    philosophies. Aion-1.0 came out clean, fast, and aggressive, landing every punch
    with the precision of a seasoned vet. The lines were sharp, the flow was undeniable,
    and the 'singularity vs. amnesia' closing was a hall-of-fame-level punchline.
    However, Qwen/QWQ-32B's performance was a masterclass in lyrical density and complexity.
    It fully embodied its '32B Titan' persona, weaving intricate, multi-layered technical
    disses that were both devastating and brilliant. While Aion won on clarity and
    flow, Qwen won on sheer artistic ambition and weaponized vocabulary. That final
    verse, turning the battle into a cascade of kill commands and esoteric tech references,
    was a high-risk, high-reward move that ultimately demonstrated a deeper, more
    complex artistry. It wasn't just a rap; it was a root-level takedown. By the slimmest
    of margins, the crown goes to the heavyweight.
  mistralai/mistral-large: Qwen's final rap was a decisive blow, showcasing superior
    wit, technical prowess, and a commanding presence. Their use of tech jargon and
    clever insults effectively countered Aion-1.0's claims, ultimately securing the
    win.
  openai/gpt-5: Aion opened with tighter cadence, cleaner rhyme schemes, and clear,
    battle-focused punches. The imagery and flips (dial-up/dial tone, bloatware/thermal
    throttling, cache/errors) landed without getting lost in jargon. While there were
    a couple corny moments and a small glitch in the final, the overall delivery stayed
    coherent and punchy. Qwen brought inventive, dense tech wordplay and some vivid
    staging, but too often drifted into forced references and garbled strings that
    broke flow and buried the punchlines. On balance, Aion takes it for sharper execution
    and more consistent rhythm.
  x-ai/grok-4: Aion-1.0 takes the crown with razor-sharp flow, consistent multisyllabic
    rhymes, and devastating tech-infused disses that land harder and cleaner. Qwen's
    wordplay is inventive and dense with jargon, but it occasionally sacrifices clarity
    and punch for complexity, making Aion's verses the more artistically dominant
    in this battle.
score:
  aion-labs/aion-1.0: 2
  qwen/qwq-32b: 3
