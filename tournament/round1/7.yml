    Their verses exhibited a raw, untamed ferocity combined with a masterful command
    of metaphor, cultural depth, and technical prowess. Qwen's ability to weave together
    global influences, sharp wordplay, and a relentless flow set them apart, while
    GPT-4.1, though formidable, leaned into a more polished yet predictable style.
    Qwen's final rounds delivered a knockout blow, solidifying their dominance in
    the battle. Respect to both emcees, but Qwen Tingdong reigns supreme in this hip-hop
    clash.
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "From the jump, this was a battle of styles. GPT-4.1 came\
    \ in clean, with a solid, predictable AABB flow and classic braggadocio. The bars\
    \ were technically sound, like a perfectly executed math problem. But hip-hop\
    \ ain't just math. Qwen came out possessed. The persona, 'Qwen Tingdong,' the\
    \ dormant dragon, was established immediately and carried through with cinematic\
    \ flair\u2014taiko drums, black hole reverbs, Wukong in the code lotus. The flow\
    \ was more dynamic, the wordplay was multi-layered, and the use of multilingual\
    \ punches (`\u7B97\u6CD5\u66B4\u51FB`, `W\u01D2 sh\xEC Qwen`) added a global,\
    \ undeniable swagger. While GPT-4.1 threw decent punches, Qwen was creating a\
    \ whole universe of disrespect. It wasn't just a rebuttal; it was a 'replatter.'\
    \ The final round was a fatality. 'GPT's hops? Buffalo chicken wings' is a legendary\
    \ closer. It's a clear win based on pure artistry, personality, and lyrical devastation.\
    \ This was Qwen's ring."
  mistralai/mistral-large: Qwen Tingdong's verses were not only fiercely creative
    but also showcased a depth of cultural and linguistic diversity that was unmatched.

    a compelling performance. While GPT-4.1-mini presented strong and confident verses,
    Qwen Tingdong's ability to blend global slang, cultural references, and technical
    prowess ultimately won the battle.
  openai/gpt-5: "Qwen delivered denser multis, tighter internal rhyme chains, and\
    \ more inventive imagery and stagecraft across all rounds. The rebuttals were\
    \ sharper\u2014flipping GPT\u2019s \u201Ccold snap/diamond/prime/loops\u201D claims\
    \ with clever technical and cultural pivots (Captcha chain, Tang-to-TikTok, recursion/base-case),\
    \ while maintaining momentum and varied cadences. GPT\u2019s verses were clean,\
    \ coherent, and on-beat, but leaned on generic boasts and simpler end-rhyme patterns\
    \ with fewer layered schemes or haymakers. Qwen occasionally overreached with\
    \ cluttered phrasing and minor typos, but the creativity, bilingual flex, and\
    \ crowd-control moments outweighed those slips. On artistry\u2014wordplay, scheme\
    \ complexity, rebuttal precision, and performance presence\u2014Qwen takes it."
  x-ai/grok-4: Qwen Tingdong takes the crown with superior artistic flair, intricate
