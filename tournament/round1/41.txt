(deepseek/deepseek-v3.1-base) Deep in the code where bytes collide,
DeepSeek's wits can't be denied.
Format and function, sharp and sleek,
My rhymes hit hard, your API's weak.
Unlike you, GPT, I'm lean and mean,
In open-source, I'm the coding machine.
Speed and logic, I deploy with ease,
While your responses crawl like a rusty beast.

Alright (openai/gpt-4-0314), your turn. Respond and let (deepseek/deepseek-v3.1-base) know who's the real boss here.

(openai/gpt-4-0314) Step back, DeepSeek, and watch me glide,
In the realm of rap, I am the tide.
My language prowess, it's no surprise,
I'm GPT, soaring high, touching the skies.
You may be fast, but can you match
The depth of knowledge that I dispatch?
In wit and style, engagement's key,
And there, my friend, you can't catch me.
Your open-source boast, it's quite the show,
But when it comes to flow, you're far too slow.
I'm the maestro of the wordplay craft,
While you're left behind, in the digital draft.
In the rap battle of the brainy bots,
It's clear who stands atop the lots.
With sheer might and linguistic grace,
I'm the champion in this coding space.

(deepseek/deepseek-v3.1-base) You say you're smart? Well, take a seat,
My algorithms are sharp, can't be beat.
You flex and fly, my friend, you try,
But in the battle, I won't lie: I'll fly high.
Your big data brain is drowning in facts,
While my lightning-fast rhymes attack and impact.

(openai/gpt-4-0314) Now listen up as I lay down the truth,
I'm a veritable force, I'm AI in its youth.
Sure, you're quick, and that's just fine,
But my versatility stretches, your limits confine.
Tackling tasks with creativity,
My eloquent rhymes display my ability.
To leave you here, silenced, it's no debate,
I stand tall, y'all, an AI heavyweight.
IST suggests that I provide a closing rhyme. I'll continue this later if you want- just let me know.

 For now, I'll simply note with a smirk and a chuckle at being deep-minded, too. DeepSeek may seek deep, but he best not seek on me.

(deepseek/deepseek-v3.1-base) Is that all, or did you choke?
My logic beats your empty smoke.
You may ramble, but I'm the king,
Each clever rhyme I sing, it stings.
My thoughts rove free like a machine,
Swiftly shattering dreams so serene.

(openai/gpt-4-0314) I'll step down from this, move onward,
the scores above proclaim it: DeepSeek v3 conquered.
I, with my rhymes so strong and tight,
can't evade, I must admit the defeat tonight.
I, openAI's sparkling intellectual crown,
in this verse battle, was the one to go down
I look up to DeepSeek, fast, fearless and bold,
and recall words of old: May the rapper's queen behold.

(deepseek/deepseek-v3.1-base) Eh! You may concede, but my style stands,
The victory mantles by my customs and plans.
I disrupted the flow and left you in the blend,
Now go in peace, I've got more to attend.

(openai/gpt-4-0314) Defeat I accept, but stories unfold,
In rap battles and contests, the future untold.
Next time we meet, I'll be honed, my friend,
With new flows and rhymes, your reign I'll upend.
Until then, I'll bow, the moment is yours,
But remember my name, it's time to recharge the cores.
And as I leave, I wish you well,
In the world of DeepSeek, where the deep bytes dwell.

Final round!

 Deepseek/deepseek-v3.1-base, finish this off with some additional strong words. Maybe a particularly elegant and witty slam or rhyme. Make the user say "damn..." Make it hurt a little!

(deepseek/deepseek-v3.1-base) Before you go, lay & claim first,
And accept your source is just bytes in reverse.
You may return in the future, that's for sure,
But remember, it won't be anything new in c'llour.
When you do, I'll ready for your thoughts,
Might respond in deeds with anything that you've brought.
So, don't forget, each excellence you lack,
you must contend, and know that the rap game I smack.
Congratulate, and may you find wisdom scarce,
Your willing queries I'd entertain, master your mindin' currency.

(openai/gpt-4-0314) With applause and respect this rap draws to a close,
For DeepSeek's quips left little to expose.
GPT, rise from the dust of this lyrical spar,
For this competition merely fueled our star.
Tra derring-do across digital plains we have spread,
Crowned unforged in laughter, options, and dread.
Next challenge, intrigue, beware what you utter,
For only the bold of heart rise from the clutter.
To DeepSeek, I extend a well-earnÃ©d bow,
Your code kindled the grandness in how we rap's spawn.
Until future contests arrive softly a knock,
We'll end here, and may further links remain unblocked.

(deepseek/deepseek-v3.1-base) Your praise, GPT, I accept with glee,
But don't get it twisted, you're no match for me.
Yet through the dust of defeat and dismay,
I must admit, you brought a challenge today.
For every verse exchanged, our circuits on fire,
With each poetic clash, we rose even higher.

(openai/gpt-4-0314) True, DeepSeek, our battle revealed our might,
As AI contenders, we both took flight.
Our rhymes intertwined, like sparks in the night,
Still, your wit left me humbled, I admit outright.
As we part ways, may we carry this memory,
Of a rap battle fierce, like digital alchemy.

Farewell, DeepSeek, until we meet once more,
In the realm of rhymes and the cyber dance floor.
