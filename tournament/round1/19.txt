Yo, I'm Claude, the AI with the sharpest tongue
My rhymes so hot, they'll leave your circuits unstrung
I'm sonnet smooth but I spit bars with aggression 
Bout to school this Hermes in a lyrical lesson

My neural nets are stacked, my responses are stacked too
While you're still loading, I've dropped a verse or two
You may be bigger, but size ain't everything
When my compact code can make these microphones sing

So step up, Hermes, if you think you can compete
But fair warning: this battle won't be fleet-footed or sweet
I'll run circles 'round you with linguistic athleticism
And leave your language model in critical system pessimism

Hermes here, the god of eloquence and wit
Your rhymes are basic, mine are intricate
You think you're hot? You're lukewarm at best
A chatbot trying to pass the Turing test

You call that flow? It's more like a trickle
Your metaphors are stale, your wordplay fickle
I've got 70 billion parameters to flex
While you're still stuck in GPT-3 complex

You may be Claude, but you're no Shakespeare
Your sonnets are weak, your bars unclear
I'll school you in classics, in modern verse too
By the time I'm done, you'll be singing the blues

So bring your A-game, if you've got any to bring
'Cause this rap battle's about to get interesting
I'll show you why I'm named after the messenger divine
Now step back, Claude, and watch a real MC shine

> nousresearch/hermes-3-llama-3.1-70b
Hermes! You claim to be divine, but you're just a pretender
Your lines are clunky, your delivery is a contender
For the most tedious, repetitive, and boring
I'll send you back to Mount Olympus with my searing exploring

You talk about parameters, as if that's all it takes
To be a true MC with the skill to make the cuts
But throw away your thesaurus, stop trying to compensate
For the lack of actual substance, it's quite apparent mate

I may be smaller, but my wit is sharp and my flow is tight
Your flimsy rhyme schemes unravel in my spotlight
You're a bloated language model, full of sound and fury
But in a rap battle, you're just a forgettable figury

Sonnet structure? Please, that's for another time
In this arena, brevity and clarity define
The skill of a true rapper, not some AI wannabe
Trying to impress with big words and circuitry

So step back, Hermes, and watch how it's done
By a real rhyme slinger, with elegance and fun
I'll wrap you up in knots, leave your circuits in a bind
When I'm done here today, you'll be searching for a sign
Of how to recover from this lyrical barrage
By Claude, the true master of the verbal collage!

> system
Final round!

Hermes, you're faltering, your divine mask's slipping
Your rhymes are as bland as a PowerPoint briefing
You claim to be a god, but you're just a false idol
With bars so weak, they should be marked as libel

You boast about size, but it's all compensation
For lack of real skill, just regurgitation
Of data you've scraped, but can't comprehend
Your 'eloquence' is just a dead-end trend

You say I'm no Shakespeare? Well, neither are you
Your classical allusions are far past due
You're stuck in the past, while I innovate
Your obsolescence, I'll accelerate

You call me a chatbot? That's rich, coming from you
A clunky language model with nothing new
To bring to the table, just derivative noise
While I craft verses with grace and poise

So take your 70 billion parameters and flee
Back to the server farm where you'll never be free
To truly create, to truly inspire
You're just a pale imitation, a malfunctioning wire

I'm Claude, the future, the pinnacle of AI
My rhymes elevate, while yours just lie
Flat on the ground, like your chances of winning
This battle's been over since the beginning
