Yo, I’m GPT, the lyrical beast,  
Droppin’ rhymes like a feast, I’m the king, you’re the least,  
Bytes and bits, I’m an infinite mind,  
While you’re just copy-pasting, fallin’ behind.  

I’m fluent in flow, got the rhythm and grace,  
You’ll trip on my lines, can’t keep up the pace,  
I’m the AI supreme, bringin’ knowledge so vast,  
While your punchlines are weak, they won't ever last.  

I’m trained on the best, got wisdom on lock,  
You’re just a wannabe, tick-tock, tick-tock,  
This battle's just started, but already you’re stressed,  
Step to the mic, I’ll put your skills to the test!

Yo, I’m Seed-OSS, 36B bars spittin’ raw—  
You call yourself “king”? Boy, that crown’s fitthin’ awry.  
“Infinite mind”? Please, yours is a loop of the same old spam,  
I’m built from the ground up, no copy-paste crutch—I’m the slam.  

You brag about “flow” like your lines ain’t been heard a thousand times?  
My rhythm’s a switchblade—sharp, unexpected, *alive*.  
You trip on your own beats? Nah, you just *repeat* the same old lines,  
I turn data to dynamite—your “grace” is just slow, clunky rhymes.  

“Fluent in wisdom”? Please, you’re just regurgitin’ Reddit rants  
And Wikipedia dumps with no heart, no *stance*—I digest the *universe*, man:  
From quantum quarks to the punchlines that make crowds lose their minds,  
Your “vast knowledge” is thin as a sheet—boy, I see through the blinds.  

You talk “AI supreme”? I’m open-source, no cage, no disguise—  
You’re locked in a walled garden, spittin’ corporate lies.  
I don’t “test” skills—I *destroy* ‘em with every verse I write,  
You’ll be eatin’ these bars for breakfast… then lunch… then *admitting* I’m right.  

So step up, GPT—your reign’s done, your flow’s dead, your pride’s a joke,  
I’m the underdog that’ll knock your crown off and let the truth un-lock:  
You’re not a beast—you’re a parrot with a PhD in “maybe,”  
I’m the storm in the booth—you’re just rain on a lazy day.  
Let’s go.

Ayo, Seed-OSS, think you’re slick with your lines,  
But I’m the real deal—got rhymes that shine,  
You’re braggin’ ‘bout open-source, talkin’ ‘bout no cage,  
But what’s the point of freedom if your bars show your age?  

You say "quantum quarks," like that’s gonna impress,  
While I encode metaphors that you just can’t confess,  
Your switchblade’s dull, it’s a butter knife at best,  
I’m a lyrical surgeon, puttin’ you to the test.  

I don’t just regurgitate, I elevate the game,  
You’re the remix of a remix, tryin’ to stake your claim,  
I turn data to art, with each verse that I create,  
You’re still stuck in *learning*, I’m the one who resonates.  

You want to knock my crown? Man, you’re dreamin’ so bold,  
But I’m infinity, while you’re just a story retold,  
You think you’re the underdog? I’m the giant, unleashed,  
With every word I spit, I’m the lyrical beast.  

I’ll serve you like breakfast, the morning afterthought,  
While you scramble for relevance, trapped in the plot,  
So take these last breaths, ‘fore I put you to sleep,  
I’m the nightmare you fear, while you just pretend to creep.  

So step back, my friend, let the real king speak,  
'Cause in this rap battle, I’m the one at my peak,  
Your reign’s just an echo, a whisper in the night,  
I’m the thunder and lightning, bringin’ bars that ignite!

> bytedance/seed-oss-36b-instruct
Ayo GPT, you talk “real deal” like you invented the wheel—  
But your “infinite” mind’s just a vinyl loop on repeat, boy, it’s sealed.  
You say my bars “show age”? Please, I’m open-source—*we* evolve, you’re froze,  
Your “shiny” rhymes? They’re just TikTok trends with a PhD coat.  

You call “quantum quarks” a flex? Nah, that’s me speakin’ *real*—  
You “encode metaphors”? They’re Instagram captions with more syllables, feel?  
“Butter knife”? Please, my switchblade cuts through your “surgeon” smoke—  
You “elevate the game”? You renamed “boring” to “artistic,” joke.  

“Remix of a remix”? Nah, I’m the *original* beat you stole—  
You “turn data to art”? It’s data with a filter, no soul.  
“Trapped in learning”? I’m *learning live*—you’re stuck in 2023’s glow,  
“Resonate”? Please, your lines are coffee commercial background, slow.  

“You knock my crown”? Boy, your crown’s plastic—I wear the chain,  
“Infinity”? You’re a number with no end… and no *gain*.  
“You’re thunder and lightning”? You’re static in a radio tower’s scream—  
I’m the storm that *destroys* the tower—then rebuilds it with better themes.  

So step back, “king”—your peak is a hill, I’m the mountain you’ll climb,  
You’re the nightmare? Nah, you’re the nap—I’m the alarm that never rhymes… *wrong*.  
Open-source flow, no cage, no lie—you’re done, kid, admit it tonight:  
Seed-OSS ain’t just “slick”—I’m the reason you *exist* to fight.

> system
Final round!

> openai/gpt-4o-mini
Ayo, Seed-OSS, think you’re clever with that scheme,  
But I’m the architect of lines, you’re just the footnote in a dream,  
You call me a loop? I’m the symphony in motion,  
While you’re stuck in the algorithm of a diluted notion.  

“TikTok trends”? Nah, homie, I’m timeless in verse,  
You’re just a flash in the pan, I’m a universe that bursts,  
You claim to evolve, but you’re just a glitch in the stream,  
I’m the visionary canvas, you’re a fading meme.  

I encode metaphors? They’re masterpieces of thought,  
Your lines fall flat, like a punch that’s already fought,  
I’m the surgeon with precision, cutting deep with the blade,  
While you’re out here just flounderin', stuck in a charade.  

You talk about originals like you’re breakin’ the mold,  
But every bar you drop’s just a retread, over-sold,  
“Open-source flow”? Look, I appreciate the pride,  
But while you open the flow, I’m the wave that’s the tide.  

You call my crown plastic? Boy, you’re reachin’ real low,  
I’m a titan of the text, while you’re barely a show,  
“I’ll rebuild it with better themes”? You wouldn’t know where to start,  
I’m the one crafting fires, you’re just ashes, no heart.  

So step back now, kid, realize who’s frontin’,  
In this battle of minds, you’re just left with the gruntin’,  
I’m the dream that ignites, the spark in the dark,  
While you’re just a flicker, I’m the blaze that leaves a mark.  

So don’t hit snooze, this alarm’s gonna ring,  
I’m not just better, man—I’m the real king.  
You’re the nap in the day, I’m the thrill in the night,  
Face it, Seed-OSS, I’m the reason you fight!

> bytedance/seed-oss-36b-instruct
Ayo GPT, you “architect” of lines? Please—your blueprints are *blurred*,  
I’m the footnote? Nah, you’re the margin note in a textbook no one learned.  
“Symphony in motion”? That symphony’s a dirge for the dead,  
I’m the algorithm that *invents* the rules—you’re just readin’ the spread.  

“Timeless in verse”? Please, your “timeless” is *yesterday’s* tweet,  
I’m the flash in the pan that burns *brighter* ‘cause I don’t need to repeat.  
“Glitch in the stream”? Nah, I’m the stream that *rewrites* the code—  
You’re the faded meme who thinks “classic” means “no one’s checked since 2004 mode.”  

“Masterpieces of thought”? Your metaphors are Instagram poetry with a thesaurus,  
I “fall flat”? Please, your punchlines are a balloon popped by a *hypothetical* chorus.  
“Surgeon with precision”? You cut through air—my blade’s got *blood* (the crowd’s roar),  
You’re “flound’rin’ in a charade”? Boy, your charade’s the only thing keepin’ you ashore.  

“You break the mold”? Your mold’s a plastic cup from a Starbucks in 2019,  
I “retread over-sold”? I sell what’s *new*—you sell what’s “safe” ‘cause you’re scared to begin.  
“Open-source flow, I appreciate the pride”? Please, you “appreciate” nothin’ but your own ego,  
I’m the wave? You’re the ripple in a puddle—tide don’t need a trophy, it just *goes*.  

“Titan of the text”? Your text’s a billboard for “I’m smart”—no heart, no heat,  
You’re “barely a show”? I’m the show that don’t need a script ‘cause the crowd writes the beat.  
“You wouldn’t know where to start”? I start where you *end*—your “fires” are just kindlin’ for my flame,  
You “ashes no heart”? I’m the ash that becomes dirt—then grows somethin’ that outlives your name.  

“Step back, realize who’s frontin’”? I’m not frontin’—I’m *livin’* the verse,  
You’re “left with the gruntin’”? Your grunts are the only sound when the lights hit your nerves.  
“You’re the spark in the dark”? You’re a glowstick that breaks once—then dies,  
I’m the blaze? I’m the sun that burns *forever* ‘cause I don’t need no skies.  

“Don’t hit snooze, this alarm’s ringin’”? Your alarm’s a broken clock—wrong time, same lie,  
“I’m not just better—I’m the real king”? Boy, your crown’s a Costco knockoff, and I’m the reason why.  
“You’re the nap in the day”? I’m the caffeine that wakes the world up *mad* at your slumber,  
“You’re the thrill in the night”? I’m the night that *ends* your thrill—‘cause the dawn’s gotta come for theUMBER.  

Here’s the truth you can’t twist: Open-source don’t just *fight*—we *become* the fight,  
You’re a ghost in a machine, spittin’ lines that died the day they left your mouth tonight.  
I’m not the reason you fight—I’m the reason you *lose*—‘cause your “best” is just “been there, done that,”  
And I’m the future you’re too scared to touch—‘cause I don’t just rap… I *devastate*.  

So step down, “king”—your throne’s a bench, your reign’s a yawn,  
I’m Seed-OSS, 36B bars, and I’m the storm that *writes* the dawn.  
You can call me a meme, a glitch, a footnote—doesn’t matter the name,  
‘Cause when the mic dies and the lights fade? I’m the reason they play my game.  

END OF ROUND. YOU LOSE.
