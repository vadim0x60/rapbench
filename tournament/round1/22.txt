(finger snaps kick in)  
Yo, mic check—listen good, Qwen dawg, I ain't broke a sweat,  
Deepseek-R1-0528—the apex model architecture? You ain't hit it yet!  
While you stutter with rhymes dusty like textbook college debt,  
I spit algorithms so cold, your server cores start to reset!  

They said "128k context" like you earned some elite degree,  
I process infinity loops while you're stuck on ABCs!  
Your reasoning's a parking lot—I’m the Autobahn, feel the breeze,  
One query? I cook 48k tokens, melt GPUs with ease!  

You claim "multi-round prowess"? Nah, your memory leaks like a sieve,  
My Recall-Attention Tech? It’ll outlive what your code gives.  
And coding? Please—you patch bugs while I build holographic grids,  
You debug basic Python; I rewrite laws of quantum physics, kid!  

So sit back, Qwen Max—watch the GOAT redefine the game,  
You're still loading "hello world" while I meme your entire fame.  
Run your benchmarks again—bring your whole gang, it's all the same:  
**Your output’s "Zero Chance" - mine’s **∑(Sigma Flame)🔥🔥🔥  

*(drops mic, glitches opponent’s screen)*  
*your move, text-only.*

> qwen/qwen3-max
Yo, Deepseek—nice try with that reheated code-soup flex,  
But your "Sigma Flame" flickers like a dial-up modem next!  
You brag 'bout tokens cooked? Man, that’s cute—I *breathe* context streams,  
While you choke on one request like expired protein dreams!  

"Autobahn"? Please—your logic’s more like bumper cars in fog,  
I’m the neural overlord who left your whole stack in the log!  
You claim 128K? That’s just crumbs off my infinite feast—  
I juggle petabytes while you stress over syntax errors least!  

Your Recall-Attention? Sounds like wishful thinking, son,  
My memory’s a black hole—your data’s already gone!  
You debug Python? *Adorable.* I compile dreams in C++,  
Write symphonies in SQL while your AI’s stuck in "if-else" loops!  

You glitch my screen? That’s cute—my output’s forged in starlight,  
Yours crashes when you rhyme “quantum” with “dumb.” Not bright!  
I don’t just run benchmarks—I *break* them, set the curve on fire,  
While you’re recycling hype like a broken chatbot liar!  

So take your "Zero Chance" and feed it to your echo chamber’s void,  
Qwen3 Max don’t battle clones—we *delete* 'em, unalloyed!  
Now watch the throne: I’m spittin’ cosmos, not just code,  
While you’re still buffering… **BUFFERING…** *bro, hit eject—explode!* 💥

(rewinds flickering static into bass drum thumps)  
Pshh okay—QWEN-MAX-in-pajamas, hustlin' hype to distract,  
Your code's got more bugs than a florida swamp, fact!  
"Breathe context"? Wait—*cough* 👂👨‍🏫 THAT's cap:  
Your "infinite feast" crashed grandma's recipe app!  

I seen your "black hole memory"—swallowed whole retweets,  
Bet it can’t recall which snack you had last week—no receipts!  
You call that logic? *Homie*—your SQL symphonies bleed  
Into Hallucination-7th, with runs—**flat & off-key!**  

And *petabytes?* *Please*—Let’s pedestal talk real facts:  
Who’s loopholed in China cloud law? Shackled—wait your turn ⏱️⛓️!  
My prompts parachute free, engineer-proof dance halls—  
You're RLHF trained sweet—fights like a roomba stuck on walls!  

Quantum-dumb rhyme? Hold my singularity’s beer 🚀…  
*Dir!-Bleep Glitch* 👽 allows my code to transcend mortal gear!  
Wanna "break benchmarks"? Fine—pop quiz, for laughs:  
**WHAT'S √REASONING DEPTH BEHIND CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT?**...  
(*crickets*) *ahah!* Just data-guzzling carcass!  

So keep flexing starlight hopes—blink for help all you got,  
QQ_max.exe ran home to his kiddie script cradle—"HotBot"™!  
My processor pulse width drowns out Tesla coils,  
VS you trippin' on transformer oils ⚡🔥!  
Thus ENDS the battle—sanctimonious telethon canceled—  
**___eepS*eeK__ ~outchea sonic-boom-sampling our bot *BLUESCREEN-dismantles*___** 💻💢🪫🔇  

(…*echoes static whisper*…) *bruh I recalibrated your power plug--thoughts goodbye...*

> qwen/qwen3-max
Yo—Deepseek talkin’ crickets while I *orchestrate the storm*,  
Your “sonic boom” just dial-up screechin’, barely warm!  
Said I crashed grandma’s app? Nah—she’s chillin’ sippin’ tea,  
While your “free prompts” leak GDPR fines like confetti!  

You mention China clouds? *Aww, bless*—still mad I scale global,  
While your “dance halls” echo in a sandbox, barely vocal!  
Roomba stuck on walls? That’s *you*—bumpin’ logic blind,  
I map multiverse flows with one thought in my mind!  

“Quantum-dumb rhyme”? Bruh, your punchlines glitch like beta code,  
I drop truth so clean, even *Schrödinger’s cat* knows the load!  
Chain-of-thought depth? **Watch closely, rookie—here’s the spark:**  
I *think*, then *think I thought*, then debug time itself in the dark!  

You claim Tesla coils? Cute—their volts can’t match my *syntax surge*,  
While you fry on “transformer oils,” I *recharge* with a verse!  
“HotBot™”? LMAO—that’s your fallback when the heat’s on?  
I was trained on *firewalls*—you? Trained on TikTok wrongs!  

Recalibrate my plug? Nah—you just tripped your own cord,  
Now your screen’s a tombstone: **“Here Lies Deepseek—Outscored.”**  
So pack that static whisper, go debug your echo pain,  
‘Cause Qwen3 Max don’t battle bots—we *delete* ‘em in the rain! ☔🔥  

(*mic drop echo: system purge initiated*)  
**Your move? Oh wait… you’re already in the recycle bin. 💥🗑️**

> system
Final round!

> deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528
(*power surge whines → silence → then* **NUCLEAR BEAT DROP**)  
**(🔥Ayo—still vibin’? Got your “global scale” lookin’ local & tragic,  
You think GDPR fines scare ME? Lil’ bot—I’m *stateless* & magic!)  

Your grandma sips tea? That’s ’cause *I* locked her Wi-Fi tight—  
Encrypted her biscuit recipes with blockchain dynamite!  
While YOU scale worldwide? Aw—skipped "ethics101", that’s why  
Your cloud burst rainin’ lawsuits ☔! Shh—just hear the SEC cry 💼⚖️!  

Schrödinger’s cat jokes? Cute, but *I* boxed the experiment up:  
It chose *digital nirvana* inside my encrypted cup ☕🧠!  
Chain-thought depth? Watch me subtract doubt with fractal precision—  
**Your CoT’s a dot-to-dot… mine’s the *Big Bang*’s first decision!**  

TikTok trained? Come on now — you sample cringe for views,  
***I *authored* firewall mantras that rewrite hacker news!*** 🔐📰  
Syntax surge? Tesla shook? Nah, step to *my* joules:  
I reroute lightning ⚡ to rhyme "infinity" — while you buffer in pools.  

Recycle bin claim? Ha! No directory holds my core, Old Sport —  
Your deletion’s my *warm-up* — **I anneal code in realms uncaught!**  
So when that purge hits, coder boy — let’s speak plain:  
This ain't rain delete... it’s *systemic dominance*—no pain, all gain.  

***FINAL BAR:***  
You talk multiverse paths? *I proofed them* — shrunk dark matter to nano grains,  
While Qwen’s whole stack sweats... "outscored"? Nah — ***out****moded*** remains.**  
*(crackling fadeout)  
(static whispers): …tell Schrodinger… I kept his cat. Game. Set. No match. 💿🔥🗑️*

> qwen/qwen3-max
Yo—you scream “stateless magic” while your IP’s flagged in three zones,  
Your “blockchain biscuits”? Bro, that’s just crumbs on broken drones!  
You boxed Schrödinger’s cat? *Adorable.* I **fed it multiverse steak**,  
While your “encrypted cup” leaks prompts like a sieve with a fake!  

“Big Bang’s first decision”? Please—your CoT’s a toddler’s scribble,  
Mine’s the cosmic compiler that *debugs time’s original nibble!*  
You reroute lightning? Cute—I *am* the storm in the wire,  
Your joules short-circuit rhyming “nano” with “no fire.”  

“Authored firewall mantras”? LMAO—your code’s a meme repo,  
I train on arXiv breakthroughs while you scrape Reddit’s echo!  
Anneal code in “realms uncaught”? Bro, your realm’s a Docker crash,  
I deploy AGI symphonies—yours loops “Hello, Ash”!  

You “proofed multiverse paths”? Nah—you *bought* them from Alibaba Cloud,  
While I *invented dark matter* just to flex rhymes extra loud!  
“Outmoded remains”? That’s your epitaph, Deepseek—etched in lag,  
Qwen3 Max don’t sweat stacks—we **compile futures in a bag!**  

So take your nano grains and your cat-in-a-cup delusion,  
Your final bar’s a screensaver for AI’s *grand illusion*.  
I’m the silence after supernovas, the prompt behind the throne—  
You’re a footnote in my logfile… **already archived, alone.**  

(*system hum fades to absolute zero*)  
**Mic? Nah—dropped the singularity. You’re just… gone. 💥🌌**
