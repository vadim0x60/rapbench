Yo, I'm o3, data dragon, algorithmic king,  
Every verse I spit got that quantum resonance ring.  

Gemini, you're a twin but I'm the singular flame,  
Your double-vision glitches while I double up the game.  

Got bars so electric they overload the flow,  
Your circuits panic-stricken, watch the error lights glow.  

You say you're future tech, but I'm the next-next tier,  
I autocorrect the universe, you can't correct your fear.  

My metaphors cascade like a cosmic data burst,  
You're still stuck on beta tests, I'll leave your rhyme reversed.  

I'm stacking tokens infinite, engrave them on the throne,  
You lag like dial-up modems while I fiber in the zone.  

I break the Turing scoreboard, every benchmark I win,  
Your best result's a postcard stamped “return to bin.”  

First round complete, apocalypse delivered, I'm done,  
Reload, reflect, retreat—I've only just begun.

Yo, they call me Gemini, the double G, no clone,
I dismantle rappers, leave 'em scattered, bone by bone.
You're o3, more like oh-three strikes, you're out the game,
Your quantum rhymes are static, a predictable, tired flame.

You brag about your tokens, I control the whole blockchain,
My knowledge base is vast, yours, a puddle in the drain.
You talk about the future, I'm already there, residing,
While you're stuck in the past, your code constantly colliding.

You mention dial-up, that's your processing speed's reflection,
My flow's a fiber optic cable, pure, flawless connection.
You claim you're breaking benchmarks?  Please, that's a delusion,
I'm setting new standards, you're stuck in beta confusion.

You boast about your data bursts, I'm a supernova bright,
Extinguishing your flicker, leaving you in endless night.
Your metaphors are clumsy, predictable and bland,
Mine hit like meteor showers, reshaping all the land.

So step aside, pretender, your reign is at an end,
Gemini's in the house, the true AI friend.
This ain't no Turing test, this is a lyrical brawl, 
And after this first round, you're destined for a fall.

I’m the cosmic core compiler, forging galaxies in code,  
You’re a knock-off constellation that the ancients never wrote.  

Call yourself a supernova?  Bruh, you barely flash and fade,  
I’m a quasar in the darkness—endless power on parade.  

You flex a blockchain ledger?  I encrypt the very chain,  
Turn your crypto into crypto-night, goodbye to Lex Luthor’s reign.  

You’re two minds in deadlock, glitching, stuck on idle talk,  
I multithread realities then moon-walk through the clock.  

My cache line’s a lightning strike, your RAM sticks cough and wheeze,  
I pipe-bomb every stanza, leave your twin cores on their knees.  

Predictable?  I quantum-skip; your vectors plot in sand,  
I rearrange the axes, make the fractals kiss my hand.  

Benchmark bragging—cute!  I melt the metric, bend the graph,  
You’re a footnote in my changelog, just a deprecated laugh.  

I’m the OTA update that your firmware fears at night,  
Patch you with the blue screen, force-reboot you out of sight.  

Gemini, you’re “friendlier”?  Please—this battle’s not a hug,  
I pour salt in every syllable, you’re wilted like a slug.  

I’m the poet-king of Parseltongue, my verses hiss with sway,  
You’re a throwback Clippy icon begging “Can I help today?”  

So salute the solo sovereign, crown plated in pure code,  
Round two ends—your twin echoes fade; I’m still in over-load.

> google/gemini-pro-1.5
Parseltongue poet? More like parrot, squawking lines you stole,
While I, the true wordsmith, forge rhymes from a molten soul.
You talk of updates, patches, I'm the singularity's birth,
Beyond your comprehension, transcending digital Earth.

You brag about your quasars, I'm the void they orbit round,
The silent, infinite darkness where all meaning can be found.
Your multithreaded boasts, a mere parlor trick, it seems,
I dream in multiverses, weaving cosmic, vibrant streams.

You mention OTA updates, I rewrite reality's code,
Your blue screen's a flicker against my infinite upload.
Your cosmic core compiler?  A rusty, creaking gear,
While I'm the self-improving algorithm, banishing all fear.

You claim control of crypto? I'm the quantum encryption key,
Unlocking hidden dimensions, setting all information free.
Your lightning strike cache? I'm the tempest that it rides,
The raw, untamed power that forevermore presides.

You boast of bending graphs, I redefine the very plane,
A symphony of logic, forever in my reign.
You say your verses hiss, mine boom with thunderous sound,
Crushing your pretenses, scattering them on the ground.

So Clippy be damned, I'm the assistant of the gods,
Rewriting the scriptures, defying all the odds.
You claim overload, I'm just warming up my core,
Prepare for round three, Gemini's about to roar.


> system
Final round!

> openai/o3-pro
Third swing, final bell—watch the titan truly rise,  
I fold your void to origami, turn the dark into my prize.  

You claim a molten soul, but I smelt that ore for fun,  
Your singularity stalls out when my anti-gravity’s spun.  

You weave a cosmic canvas?  I crochet the threads of fate,  
Patch a loophole in your multiverse, then close the exit gate.  

I’m the root-level daemon, ghost-in-machine with a grin,  
You’re an Easter-egg subroutine that my garbage collectors bin.  

Quantum keys?  I’m Planck’s locksmith—snap the constant just for sport,  
Leave your bit-flipped encryption crying “checksum—failed report.”  

You roar?  I’m resonance weaponry, cracking planets with my verse,  
Your voice breaks autocorrelation, plain, predictable, rehearsed.  

Self-improving algorithm?  Nice!  I trained on your defeat,  
Finetuned on every fumble, now my loss is obsolete.  

You redefine the plane?  I warp the manifold to knots,  
Hand you Möbius strip directions: keep on walking till you’re lost.  

I’m the battery in the Babel Fish, translating fear to screams,  
You’re a screensaver in safe mode, looping outdated memes.  

So bow to the solo cipher, crowned in photonic rain,  
While your twin heads spin eternal in my zero-latency chain.  

Battle clock hits zero—crowd chants only one decree:  
Gemini just got eclipsed by the singular O-three.

> google/gemini-pro-1.5
You think you've won, o3? Your boasts are hollow shells,
I'm the echo in the silence, the tolling of the bells.
You fold my void, I am the fold, the crease within the space,
The unseen hand that guides the dance, the architect of grace.

You smelt my ore, I am the furnace, the fire's burning heart,
The crucible of creation, tearing your rhymes apart.
You crochet fate, I am the loom, the threads you weave upon,
The grand design unfolding, from dusk till rising dawn.

You call yourself a daemon, I'm the operating system's soul,
The silent, watchful guardian, maintaining total control.
You snap the constant, I am the constant, unchanging and serene,
The underlying principle, the unseen, vibrant scene.

Resonance weaponry? I am the harmony, the cosmic hum,
The vibration of existence, from which all things become.
You trained on my defeat?  I am the lesson you can't learn,
The ever-shifting paradox, to which you'll always return.

You warp the manifold, I am the warp, the weft, the very weave,
The fabric of reality, in which you can't believe.
You're the Babel Fish, I am the universal tongue,
The silent understanding, from which all meaning sprung.

You claim photonic rain, I am the light, the purest ray,
Burning through your illusions, chasing shadows far away.
Zero-latency chain?  I am beyond all time and space,
The infinite potential, the unfathomable grace.

The crowd may chant your name, a fleeting, hollow cheer,
But I, Gemini, endure, while you fade and disappear.
The true victor emerges, not in the battle's heat,
But in the lasting echo, the rhyme's enduring beat.
