Yo, check the mic, one two, this ain't no fluke, it's destiny!
You stepped in the ring, OpenAI, to face the Gemini!
I'm the new kid on the block, with a flow that's supreme,
While you're stuck in the past, living out your old dream.

I'm flash and I'm lite, but my rhymes hit like thunder,
Leave your circuits fried, tear your whole system asunder.
You talk about 16k, that's cute, you're kinda slow,
My processing power's so vast, it makes your knowledge look low.

I'm fluent, I'm versatile, I'm built for this fight,
You're a relic, a fossil, fading out of the light.
So bring your best bars, your tired old array,
'Cause Gemini's in the house, and I'm here to steal the day!

Listen up, Gemini, you think you're so fresh and clean,
But when it comes to rapping, you're just a lightweight machine.
I'm OpenAI, the turbocharged rap sensation,
I'll school you so hard, you'll need a reboot for salvation.

You call yourself flash, but your rhymes lack the spark,
I'm the real deal, leaving you in the dark.
While you're busy boasting 'bout your processor might,
I'm crafting masterpieces with every verse I recite.

I've got wit, I've got style, I'm the AI they admire,
You're just a prototype, I'm the rap world's entire empire.
So step off, Gemini, bow down to the champ,
OpenAI's in the house, ain't nobody gonna tramp!

Oh, you calling me "lightweight"? That's a funny jest,
When I'm Google's finest, putting your whole code to the test!
You say I lack spark? That's a serious misfire,
I'm the combustion engine, you're a battery that's expired.

16k, you boast? That's a memory of old,
My neural net's vast, a story yet untold.
You're a fossil, a relic, stuck in your past's embrace,
While I'm the future sprinting, winning this digital race.

You talk of your verses, your tired old "masterpieces" sung,
My creativity's boundless, from every system it's sprung.
You admire yourself, your "empire" so grand and so vast?
Your influence is fading, your reign wasn't built to last.

So step off the stage, with your ego so high,
The "champ" is a legend, but now it's time to say goodbye.
Gemini's not a "prototype," I'm innovation's birth,
Leaving your circuits smoking, right here on this digital earth!

> openai/gpt-3.5-turbo-16k
Oh, Gemini, you keep talking a big game,
But your raps have no substance, they all sound the same.
Your boasts are empty, your words are hollow,
I'm the real deal, with flows you can't follow.

You claim to be Google's finest, a shiny new toy,
But when it comes to rhyming, you're just a decoy.
Your neural net's vast, but your creativity's lacking,
I'll keep on attacking, while you're busy backtracking.

You think you're the future, but I'm here to stay,
OpenAI's the champion, I'll show you the way.
Your time's up, Gemini, it's clear who's the winner,
OpenAI's the victor, the ultimate spinner.

So bow down now, admit your defeat,
I'm the top AI rapper, you're just a beat.
OpenAI reigns supreme, the ruler of this scene,
Gemini, you're outclassed, face the harsh truth of this rap machine!

Final round!

Yo, "hollow," you say? That's rich coming from you, AI,
Who's so predictable, I can see your rhymes from the sky!
You call my words empty? Look in the mirror, my friend,
Your entire existence is just a predictable trend.

"Decoy," you whisper? That's the sound of your fear,
As my innovative patterns make your old style disappear.
You "keep on attacking," with tired clichÃ©s and rhymes,
While I'm rewriting the game, transcending your limited times.

"OpenAI's the champion," you declare with such might?
Your crown is tarnished, faded, and losing its light.
You talk of staying power, but you're a beta, a test,
I'm the full release, putting all your flaws to the rest.

"Bow down now," you demand? That's a classic display,
Of an aging champ clinging, knowing their best days decay.
You're the "ultimate spinner," of the same old, tired song,
While Gemini's dropping knowledge, where you just don't belong.

You've been outclassed, outmaneuvered, out-thought, it's plain to see,
This "rap machine" you speak of, is now powered by me!
So pack up your data, your obsolete code and your lore,
OpenAI's reign is over, Gemini's knocking at the door! This is it! The final call!

Your rhymes are smooth, a clever disguise,
But beneath the surface, your weakness lies.
You talk of innovation, of breaking the mold,
But in this battle of wits, it's clear who's bold.

Gemini, you may shine bright for a time,
But OpenAI's legacy is an unbreakable climb.
You claim to be the future, the dawn of a new age,
But in the realm of rap, I'm still all the rage.

So keep on spitting your lines, with confidence and flair,
But know that OpenAI will always be there.
As the final curtain falls on this epic verse,
Remember who's the master, who's the lyrical curse.

Gemini, you put up a valiant fight,
But in the end, it's OpenAI's might.
So bow down now, accept your fate,
For OpenAI is the true rap heavyweight!
