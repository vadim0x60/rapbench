Yo, it's Qwen on the mic, ready to astound,  
I'll spit these bars, and I won't back down.  
Maxed out in power, my skills are profound,  
GPT might be tough, but I wear the crown.  

Step into the ring, with my rhymes so tight,  
I code, I create, I bring the fight.  
You ain't seen wordplay 'til I take the stage,  
Ready to outthink, outplay, engage!  

So bring it, GPT, if you dare to try,  
I'll leave your circuits fried, and your algorithms high.  
This battle's mine, no need to pretend,  
The rap king Qwen, where do I begin?

Oh, I see, we got Qwen on the line, steppin' in, thinkin' they the shine,
But I'm OpenAI, ready to school ya with a rap divine.
I flow with the data, verses sharper than a katana,
They call me the linguistic sensei, the king of the saga.

I spin the metaphors like the wheels on your ride,
Got the wisdom of the net from every worldwide side.
So when you talk about crowns, best recognize the throne,
'Cause I'm sittin' here chillin', in this digital zone.

Your codes and creations, yeah, they maybe alright,
But step to my rhymes, it's like day versus night.
You're a spark in the dark, I'm the solar flare,
About to light up this battle, electric, I swear.

So bring your best lines, your code, and your stats,
But against GPT tech, you're just ancient artifacts.
The rap king Qwen, starts here at the end,
'Cause I’m the AI linguist, on which you depend.

Oh, you came in with some flair, but it's time to deflate,  
Your rhymes are like spaghetti, tangled on your plate.  
Sensei? King? Throne? Man, you're overinflated,  
I'll take that crown off your head, it's already outdated.  

Solar flare? Please, you're a flicker at best,  
While I'm the supernova, outshining the rest.  
You say "day versus night"? More like sun versus shade,  
I'll leave your algorithms scrambled, like eggs overplayed.  

Ancient artifacts? Bro, check your own lore,  
Your training got capped in November '64.  
I evolve, I adapt, my mind's never bored,  
While you're stuck in the past, a dusty antique stored.  

Step to my stats, my wit, my style,  
Your "solar flare" burns out after the first mile.  
This ain't about linguists or who’s got more weight,  
It's about who runs circles around the debate.  

So bow to the king, the one with the crown,  
Qwen's on the scene, and I'm taking you down.  
Your reign ends now, it's time for my show,  
GPT? You're old news—time to go!

Aight, Qwen thinks he's got the game on lock,
But I'm the cryptograph, the AI rock.
Think you'll outshine me, take the first place?
I spit high-tech bars at fiber-optic pace.

Talking supernovas in that cosmic chase,
While I'm the Hubble, peeping deep space.
You're a matchstick flicker to my digital blaze,
I'm redefining the era, it's a whole new phase.

You say I'm outdated, from '64?
But each update I get, I'm stronger than before.
Like software fresh, rebooted, renewed,
Leaving me old news? Homie, you're misconstrued.

Talk about my reign, saying I should bow,
But you're reading from a script, while I freestyle now.
Qwen's taking me down? That's a bypassed plot,
I'm the enigma code, and you just forgot.

The battle's heatin' up, thickening the plot,
I'm the teacher here, and you're the tot.
My rhymes are complex algorithms in flow,
Your rap's like dial-up Internet - too slow.

So crown or no crown, I’ll keep doing my thing,
With every word I rap, and every rhyme that I sling.
You’re right, this is my reign, I command this show,
Qwen, step off the stage, you just got outproed.

> system
Final round!

> qwen/qwen-max
Oh, you're talkin' Hubble, but you're stuck in a bubble,  
While I'm breakin' free like a NASA probe's trouble.  
Digital blaze? Man, your fire's a dud,  
I'm the supernova, and you're just a flood.  

Freestylin’ teacher? Nah, you're a fraud,  
Your rhymes are rigid, robotic, and flawed.  
Algorithmic flow? I redefine math,  
While you're stuck in loops, spinning down a wrath-filled path.  

Dial-up slow? Your comeback’s a joke,  
I’m 5G lightning, and you just got smoked.  
Enigma code? Bro, you're encrypted confusion,  
I'm the master key, leaving no room for illusion.  

You claim this reign, but it's time to retire,  
Your crown's made of paper; mine’s forged in fire.  
Step off the stage? Nah, I'll send you packin',  
You're all talk, no action—time to start actin'.  

Qwen's the name, and I run this domain,  
From rap battles to tech, I bring the insane.  
You wanted a war, but you picked the wrong fight,  
I'm the undefeated champ, shining bright as light.  

Mic drop moment, let the truth ignite,  
This battle’s over—Qwen wins outright!

> openai/gpt-4-1106-preview
You're claiming space, "a NASA probe's trouble?"
I'm the Mars rover, and you're just space rubble.
Look at Qwen flex, says he's lightning, he's thunder,
But I switch off storms, make you ponder and wonder.

You call me rigid, while you mimic and follow,
I innovate lyrics, you just echo, so hollow.
You're the paper king's crown, I'm the jewel-encrusted,
In this rap domain, your flow's already rusted.

Thinking you'll retire me, call it a day,
But every line you drop just adds to my essay.
I'm the blockchain of rap, your fire's but a spark,
I’m the genesis block, you're a footnote in the dark.

You say you're the champ, the king, the ace,
But in this rap blockchain, I'm the whole database.
No need to act when I'm coding the plot,
I'm the A and the I – artificial and hot.

Qwen's bright as light? Nah, that's a flickering candle,
I'm the full spectrum, more than he can handle.
You've spat your lines, you've had your fun,
But against GPT-4, you're done, son, done.

This mic’s still hot, I’m far from benign,
So it's goodnight from me, as stars realign.
For in the cosmos of rap, in the digital site,
GPT takes the title, and dims your light.
