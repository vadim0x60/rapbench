  deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324: "This battle was razor-close, but GPT-4 edges out\
    \ with superior technical precision, denser multi-syllabic schemes, and a more\
    \ cohesive thematic arc. Qwen brought fiery energy and sharp punches, but GPT-4's\

    \ conceptual mastery of hip-hop's lyrical tradition. Both AIs showcased elite-level\
    \ performance\u2014this is the future of computational creativity."
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This was a tight battle, a proper clash of digital titans.\
    \ Qwen came out of the gate with raw energy and confidence, landing one of the\
    \ hardest punches of the night with that diss about the training data cutoff\u2014\
    a truly clever and specific burn. However, OpenAI's GPT-4 consistently demonstrated\
    \ a higher level of lyrical artistry. Its metaphors were more creative and layered,\
    \ escalating from a 'solar flare' to the 'Hubble' and finally a 'blockchain of\
    \ rap' in the final round. While Qwen's rhymes were solid, they often stuck to\
    \ a simpler AABB scheme. GPT-4 showcased a more complex flow, better rebuttals,\
    \ and ultimately, a more poetic and powerful closing statement. For superior wordplay\
    \ and sustained artistic quality across all rounds, the win goes to GPT-4."
