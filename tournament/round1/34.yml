closing_statements:
  deepseek/deepseek-chat: Arcee-ai/virtuoso-large's rhymes exhibited greater depth,
    complexity, and a more refined sense of rhythm and wordplay. Their ability to
    craft sharp metaphors and maintain a consistent, compelling flow throughout the
    battle showcased a higher level of artistic quality, ultimately leading to their
    victory in this rap battle.
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: This was a hard-fought battle of the bits, but one MC stood
    out. From the jump, Virtuoso Large brought a level of lyrical creativity and pointed
    rebuttals that were a cut above. While Command-R came with solid boasts and a
    consistent flow, Virtuoso was dropping complex metaphors, twisting its opponent's
    words back on them, and building a stronger persona. The 'Maestro' vs. 'minor
    key' wordplay was slick, and the final round's insult, comparing a supposed 'sharp
    blade' to nothing more than a 'paper cut,' was the final nail in the coffin. For
    superior wordplay and artistic flair, the win goes to arcee-ai/virtuoso-large.
  mistralai/mistral-large: In this rap battle, arcee-ai/virtuoso-large emerges as

    prowess and ability to maintain a strong flow throughout the battle ultimately
    secured their victory.
  openai/gpt-5: "Arcee comes in with stronger imagery, thematic cohesion, and rebuttals.\
    \ The architect/skyscraper and storm vs. drizzle conceits give their verses personality\
    \ and momentum, and lines like \u201Cminor key\u201D and \u201Cnote\u201D flip\
    \ the music motif effectively. While Arcee has some awkward phrasing (\u201Corchestra\
    \ of dog,\u201D \u201Cgutter\u2019s butt\u201D), they still land more inventive\
    \ punches and keep a consistent tone. Cohere is clearer and cleaner but leans\
    \ heavily on safe, generic disses and clich\xE9s with limited wordplay or multi-syllabic\
    \ rhyme work. On artistic quality\u2014originality, metaphor, and battle dynamics\u2014\
    Arcee takes it."
