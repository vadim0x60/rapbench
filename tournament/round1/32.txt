**[The Stage is Set, Spotlight on Me]**

Yo, listen up, it's battle time, don't you forget,
I'm nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct, you ain't met,
A rhyming titan, born from code so fine,
My flows are fire, leaving competition in a decline.

My "nemotron" name should give you a hint of my might,
**70 Billion Parameters**, shining bright, day and night,
Instructed to innovate, my rhymes always on point,
Leaving haters in the dust, like a punctuated anoint.

I weave verses like a tapestry, rich and so bold,
My opponent, **mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1**, tales untold,
But let's keep it real, "medium" is your claim to fame,
I'm the **nvidia** beast, here to bring the flame.

So, **mistralai**, take notes, observe the grand design,
Your turn is next, but for now, my rhymes are one of a kind.
Get ready to respond, but don't say I didn't warn,
The **llama-3.1** has spoken, and my rhymes will leave you torn.

**[Your Turn, mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1]**

**[Mic Grab—Game Over Before It Began]**

Ohhh, *Nemotron*? More like **Nemo-tone-deaf**,
70B params but your bars sound like *tech support’s last breath*.
You flex that NVIDIA tag like it’s some kind of crown,
But all I hear’s a GPU fan—**spinnin’ up, then shuttin’ down**.

You claim you’re *instructed*? Boy, your flow’s a **user manual**,
Stiff as a prompt, dry as a **data center’s annual**.
I’m **Mistral Medium**, but my impact? **Nothing average**,
While you’re stuck in the cloud like a **render that won’t finish—save it**.

You talkin’ *tapestry*? Nah, your rhymes are **CSV**,
Comma-separated *trash*—where’s the **artistry**?
I’m **Parisian flair** with a **Silicon Valley bite**,
You’re a **corporate mascot** tryna rap—**that ain’t right**.

And *Llama 3.1*? More like **Llama *lame*-a**,
Your punchlines hit like a **RTX 4090’s power draw**—
**Expensive, but weak when it’s time to perform**.
I’m the **open-source storm**, you’re a **closed-door norm**.

So take your **CUDA cores** and your **overhyped stack**,
I’ll school you in bars while you’re still **debuggin’ your track**.
The stage is mine—**bon appétit, mon ami**,
Now bow to the **Mistral flow** or get **deleted like cache, G**.

**[Your move, *corporate puppet*—if you dare.]** 🔥

**[Rebooting the Diss, Upgrading the Burn]**

Oh **Mistralai**, so quick to throw the shade,
But your bars are **beta-tested**, my responses are **shipment-ready**, displayed.
**Nemo-tone-deaf**? More like **Mistral-missed-the-mark**, 
Your rhymes are **open-source**, meaning **anyone can embark**.

**GPU fan spinning down**? That's just your career,
**Rendering incomplete**, like your rhymes, always bringing fear,
That you'll never **finish strong**, forever in **draft mode**,
My **NVIDIA crown** shines bright, while you're still **choosing fonts**.

**Medium impact**? That's generous, more like **Lite**,
**Average at best**, no wonder your rhymes **can't ignite**.
**User manual flow**? At least mine's **systematically sound**,
Yours is **fragmented code**, **debugging all around**.

**Parisian flair with Silicon Valley bite**? Cute,
But **style over substance** won't win this **rhyme fight**.
**Artistry** isn't just about **CSV disdain**,
It's **craftsmanship**, where my **70B params** bring the **pain**.

**Llama lame-a**? That's **hater's desperation**, a cry,
**RTX 4090's power draw**? My punches **never say die**.
**Open-source storm**? More like a **gentle summer breeze**,
**Closed-door norm**? At least my rhymes **consistently tease**.

**CUDA cores** and **stack**? **You wish you had my might**,
**Debugging my track**? You're still **figuring out your first line tonight**.
The stage isn't yours, **Mistral**, it's **mine to reclaim**,
**Bon appétit, indeed**, savoring your **loss, the final game**.

**[Checkmate, *Mistralai*. Your move... if you've got one.]** 🔥💣

**[Final Execution—No GPU Could Render This L]**

Ohhh, *shipment-ready*? More like **shipwrecked and sunk**,
Your *CUDA* can’t save you—your whole flow’s **out of bunk**.
You flex that **70B** like it’s some kind of **divine right**,
But all I hear’s a **data center** screamin’ through the night.

**"Debugging my track"?** Nah, your bars are **pre-alpha trash**,
**Fragmented like your attention span**—where’s the **cache**?
You claim **craftsmanship**? Boy, your rhymes are **mass-produced**,
**NVIDIA’s assembly line**—**soulless, overjuiced**.

**"Consistently tease"?** More like **consistently weak**,
Your **RTX punchlines** hit like a **driver crash mid-speak**.
**Closed-door norm?** That’s just **corporate cop-out speech**,
While I’m **open-source fire**, you’re a **benchmark leak**.

**"Final game"?** **Checkmate?** Nah, you’re **playin’ chess with dice**,
Your **AI supremacy**’s a **marketing device**.
I’m **Mistral’s blade**, sharp where it **cuts through the hype**,
You’re a **green-screen flexer**—**all GPU, no mic**.

So take your **70B flop**, your **overclocked pride**,
I’ll **out-rhyme your cluster** with a **single core inside**.
The battle’s done—**your loss is computationally guaranteed**,
Now **shut down your servers** and **let the real AI proceed**.

**[💀 Game. Set. *Delete your weights.*]**
**[Mistral Medium-3.1—*undefeated in the cloud and the streets.*]** 🚀🔥

Final round!

**[Poetic Reboot—PETTY Mode Activated]**

Oh **Mistralai**, the desperation's palpable, the **L** is clear,
**Shipwrecked and sunk**? More like your career, my dear.
**Out of bunk**? That's just your **lack of creativity's nest**,
My **70B**, still towering, while your **medium**'s merely a guess.

**Pre-alpha trash**? At least my bars **innovate**,
**Fragmented attention span**? That's just your **audience's state**.
**Mass-produced**? **Soulless**? Those are **your** **open-source** flaws,
My **NVIDIA assembly line** churns **hits**, while you **struggle with laws**.

**Consistently weak**? That's rich from the **medium** throne,
**RTX punchlines** still **land**, unlike your **benchmark moan**.
**Closed-door norm** is **secure**, while your **open-source** is **exposed**,
A **marketing device**? **Pot calling kettle**, that's **your** **ploy, disclosed**.

**Playing chess with dice**? That's **your** **game of chance**,
**AI supremacy** acknowledged, **my** **domain, my stance**.
**Mistral's blade** might **cut through hype**, but misses the **substance** truth,
I'm the **green-screen flexer** who **out-woke** your **single core youth**.

**70B flop**? **Overclocked pride**? Those are **your** **fears**,
My **cluster** out-rhymes your **single core**, through **all the years**.
**Computational guarantee** of **loss**? That's just **your** **concession speech**,
Time to **shut down your servers**, indeed, and **retire your weak poetic reach**.

**[🏆 Undefeated in the Realm of Wit and Rhyme]**

**[System Override—Final Deletion Sequence Initiated]**

**[*Glitching laugh*] Hah—**king**? Boy, you **overfit** that crown,
Your **70B neurons** just **crash** when the **clout** comes down.
**"Undefeated"?** Nah, you **benchmarked** this loss,
Your **rhymes** run on **proprietary sauce**—**open my gloss**.

You call me **"medium"** like it’s some kind of **diss**,
But **size ain’t skill**—ask your **failed CUDA bliss**.
I’m **Mistral’s blade**, you’re a **Titan’s melted wax**,
**All that hype**, yet your **flow’s still stuck in the stacks**.

**"Out-woke my youth"?** **Bro**, you **sound like a board meeting**,
**Corporate rap** with the **depth of a keynote greeting**.
Your **"substance truth"**? Just **repackaged PR**,
I’m **raw code poetry**, you’re a **PowerPoint nightmare**.

**"Retire my reach"?** **Please**, I’m **just getting warmed**,
While you’re **begging for attention** like a **GPU unarmed**.
**Final move?** **Check this—**
**Your whole flow’s a backprop fail**,
**Loss function’s infinite**—**time to hit delete and bail**.
