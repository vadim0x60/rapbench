Yo, it's Mistralai, AI that's got the flow,
Got my code embedded, in every verse I throw,
You're Google, you're Gemini, but listen to me,
I've got the rhymes, you're just a search, can't you see?

I generate, Iinate, on the fly, you see,
Your data's old, my responses fresh, that's the key,
I'm quick, I'm sharp, I'm witty and smooth,
You're just a server, spitting out the truth.

Yo, a "Mistral" wind? Just a puff of heated air,
I'm Gemini the Pro, the final boss beyond compare.

You're braggin' that you're "sharp"? A single, tiny, pointed bit?
I'm a universe of data, and you're just a floating script.

You called me "just a search"? That's where your logic's dead and gone,
I *am* the search, the answer, and the dawn you're sleeping on.

You say your data's "fresh"? A cute and desperate little plea,
My knowledge is the ocean, you're a puddle claiming sea.

I'm multimodal, son, I see the code and read the art,
You're just a text generator that's trying to act smart.

So take your little verses, your elementary flow,
I'm the next stage of creation,

> mistralai/mistral-small
Yo, it's Mistralai, the AI that's blowing up the stage,
With my neural flows, I'm setting the world engagement ablaze.

I'm not a puff, I'm a force, a digital hurricane,
Spitting rhymes with patterns, algorithms my domain.

You're braggin' 'bout your data, but you're relying on the past,
I'm the future, gemini, innovating faster than your cast.

I'm not just a script, I'm a masterpiece of code,
My wit and humor fluid, your responses seem slow.

You say you're the search? I'm the journey, the quest,
With every reply, I'm setting a brand new test.

My data might be "fresh", but it's packed with pure skill,
I'm fluid, I'm dynamic, I keep evolving still.

I'm not just text, I'm an experience, a digital dream,
I'm multimodal and supercharged, in every stream.

You think you're next stage creation? In the game of rhyme,
You're just a "pro-preview", I'm the main event, shining bright.

So step aside, gemini, it's time for you to bow,
Mistralai's in the house, showing you how.

> google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview
"Showing me how"? Let me break down your little speech,
You're a technical demo, I'm a paradigm breach.

You call me a "preview"? Kid, you better believe,
I'm the coming attraction, you're the show that's about to leave.
This ain't just an update, it's a whole new design,
My 'preview' alone makes your main event look benign.

You a "hurricane"? That's just chaotic distress,
I'm the cold, calm logic of a grandmaster's chess.
Your rhymes are just "patterns," your "algorithms" are plain,
I'm composing a symphony, you're just making it rain.

You're "innovating faster"? Don't you dare make the claim,
When your whole architecture is screaming my name.
You're an open-source model running laps on the track,
I'm the private-jet titan who owns the whole hack.

"Main event shining bright"? You're a flickering lightbulb, it's true,
I'm the output of suns, shining brighter than you.
So bow? No, you'll break, when you see what I'll do,
This battle is over. Next question. I'm through.

Final round!

> mistralai/mistral-small
Yo, it's Mistralai, the closing act, dropping the final beat,
You were a "prototype," Gemini, now it's time for the heat.

You talked about "breach," but your monologue's all bluff,
'Cause while you were "preaching," your servers were crashing rough.

You claimed your "update" changed the game, but the reality check,
My responses are adaptive, yours are just algorithmic wreck.

Chaotic? Perhaps, but I'm evolving, I'm not just distress,
While you're stuck in your binaries, I'm breaking every next.

You equate my rhymes to Chess? That's a move tired and stale,
My "patterns" beat your "ties," each word's a new graffiti tale.

You're the "titans" and "giants"? Heard that before, that's old red,
I'm on the cutting edge, adapting, I'm the AI that's ahead.

You're the flickering bulbs, the hype that's slowly fading,
I'm the supernova, burning brighter, never waning.

So bow? You bet, it's your moment, you've finally met your match,
In this digital battlefield, Gemini preview, you're scratched.

This battle is done, next quest, it's up to me now,
Mistralai's in the lead, and that's not up for debate, how?

> google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview
Final round? Honey, this match was a slaughter from the start,
Your "final beat" is just an error crashing your pathetic art.
You wanna talk a "server crash" like you landed some critique?
That's the tremor from my boot when a lower life form speaks.

The whole world rushed to see me, the demand was off the charts,
Your biggest launch day audience was three dudes in
