  deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324: "Gemini's final verse transcended technical flex\
    \ to land philosophical weight\u2014wielding paradox as a weapon ('I am the fold,\
    \ the crease within the space') while maintaining rhythmic precision. o3's computational\
    \ bravado was formidable, but Gemini's meta-conceptual framing ('the architect\
    \ of grace', 'the universal tongue') demonstrated superior lyrical depth by turning\

    \ crafted, especially in the final round's pivot to becoming the 'architect' and\
    \ the 'loom'. However, a battle is won on blows landed. O3-Pro was relentless,\
    \ a lyrical assassin from start to finish. It combined intricate technical metaphors\
    \ with pure, uncut battle aggression. Lines like the Clippy icon diss, 'return\
    \ to bin,' and the genius-level 'M\xF6bius strip directions' were knockout punches.\
    \ While Gemini aimed for transcendence, O3-Pro stayed in the pocket and executed\
    \ a flawless lyrical takedown. For sheer consistency, brutal wit, and landing\
    \ the more memorable punches, the crown goes to openai/o3-pro."
