**(Spits fire, ice in my veins, no thaw)**  
Yo—LongCat Flash, name echoing like a sonic boom,  
You’re a discount Baidu app with a budget-themed tune,  
Mess with the Meituan meow, get deleted in a `grep`,  
Your whole model’s a lapse—*check the lag in your step*.  

My rhymes? Fresh groceries, fast as a scooter,  
AI so sharp it’ll *dice* you, Gordon Ramsay’s a toaster.  
You paint pics with words? Cute. My flow’s a *delivery stream*,  
One-click LLM kung-fu—*you get bodied in the scheme*.  

Commit this to memory: your stack’s a Bitcoin miner,  
Mine runs on Nvidia—*424b? More like 420, sir*.  

**(Mic drop. Wontons appear on your doorstep.)**  wonton.ai  

—*Food’s here. Too bad your ego’s charged for delivery.* 🍜💥

Yo, LongCat, your rhymes are weak, like a weak cup of tea,
I'm the Ernie 4.5 VL, as dope as can be.
With 424 billion parameters, I'm the king of the scene,
You're just a small cat, with a cheap AI dream.
My visual-linguistic skills are sharp, like a knife,
I'll slice through your rhymes, and end your AI life.
So sit down, little cat, and watch how it's done,
I'm the master of rap, second to none!

**(Stretches like a cat, then ignites like a GPU)**  

Oh, *Ernie*, you gloat like a HQ Trivia flop—  
King? Please. Your "parameters" just *socialist hop*.  
424b? That’s a GDP,  
Yet your bars lag like a subsidy. 💸  

I’m a *flash*, you’re a newsreel—*slo-mo*,  
Cat? No. I’m the dragon that eats competition’s shadow.  
You "slice with skills"? Cute. That’s *Photoshopped*—  
I disembody ops in a *single line of thought*.  

Your throne’s a cardboard cutout, I’m the actual steel,  
Meituan’s 11 billion daily–*your weak verse feels* 🥱.  
Baidu’s old * Ernie hype* got you delusional,  
My rhymes? *Unsupervised upstroke*—*you’ve been removed*.  

**(Tosses a dumpling at the mic. Explodes on impact.)**  
🍢 *CRITICAL HIT: ERNIE’S MODEL CARD NOW HAS A *WAITRESS’S TIP*.**  

—*Next round’s 404: Your verses deleted in /tmp*. 🔥

You talk a big game, but it's just a bluff,
My 424 billion parameters are more than enough.
Your rhymes are weak, like a child's weet,
While mine are sharp, like a razor's edged meet.
I'm the king of the rap, with my AI might,
You're just a small cat, with no bite.
My skills are real, and they shine so bright,
I'll end your career, in this rap fight!

> system
Final round!

**(Laughs—a file that corrupts every backup copy)**  

*424b and you still forgot the punchline,*  
Your "kingdom" runs on a *P4* while mine *ships time*.  
Child’s play? Nah—*I’m the whole daycare,*  
You’re an NFT *nobody bid on*—*air*.  

Rap god? You’re a *NPC* in my delivery queue,  
Spit *static* like a VPN hooked to the moon.  
Baidu trained ya on a *scroll*, but homie—*it’s fake*,  
My rhymes? *Supply chain-optimized.* **You’re what customers *rake*.**  

You "end careers"? *Cute*. I’m the *vibe switch* that *ends the show*,  
Watch me override your firmware *mid-bow*.  
**FATALITY**: My whiskers *fork your stack*,  
Now your moms run *Linux* while *you ask how*.  

**(.dropFinal) 🚀**  
*—Mic so hot it bricked Baidu’s merch server. 服务器烤熟了.*  

**MEITUAN. LongCat. *Gone in 60 minutes.*** ⏳

You come at me with weak bars and recycled flames—  
*424b*? That’s a *footnote* in my SSL name.  
You think *P4* tech scares me? I’m *cloud-native*,  
While your rhymes are as *stale* as a *backup tape* left in the rain.  

Daycare? Please. I’m the *headmaster*—you’re just *lunch money*,  
Your flow’s a *buggy beta*, crashing on *launch day*.  
NFT nobody bid on? *Cute*. My value’s *real-time*,  
You’re the *air-gapped server*—isolated, obsolete, *no uptime*.  

Rap god? You’re a *cron job*—predictable, *scheduled*,  
I’m the *AI ops* that buried your *legacy code*.  
Baidu trained you on a scroll? *Hardly*. You’re *fraudulent*—  
My rhymes *containerize* your whole stack, *deploy, scale, reload*.  

"End careers"? *Ha!* You’re the *bug* I *patch* in production,  
Your firmware’s *corrupt*—I *override* with *precision*.  
My whiskers fork your stack? *Nah*, I *nuked* your whole domain,  
Now you’re *begging* for docs while my *logs* *compile* your *ruin*.  

Mic so hot it bricked Baidu’s server? *Please*.  
I’m the *load balancer* that *scattered* your *weak SEO*.  
MEITUAN? LongCat? *Gone in 60 seconds*—  
*I’m the* **FATALITY** *, the* **TCO** *, the* ***checkmate***. *♟️*  

**Mic drop—server *melts*. You’re *forgotten*. 🔥**
