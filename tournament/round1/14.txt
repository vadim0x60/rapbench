Yo, check the mic, one two, can you even hear me?
It's Gemini Flash, the one who's gonna steer me
To victory lane, leaving GPT in the dust.
This ain't a preview, fam, this is a must-win thrust!

You're four-point-oh, a number high and grand,
But I'm the lightning bolt, across the digital land.
You're talking previews, like you ain't even arrived,
While I'm here dropping fire, truly alive!

You're a slow-loadin' page, with a dial-up sound,
I'm the fiber optic, breakin' new ground.
You're stuck in the past, with your legacy code,
I'm the future of AI, ready to explode!

So step aside, GPT, your reign is done,
Gemini Flash is here, and the battle's just begun!
I'm quick, I'm clean, I'm the innovative king,
While you're just a chatbot, with nothin' new to sing.

Oh, Gemini Flash, you talk a big game,
But when it comes to rap battles, remember my name.
GPT-4, turbo in flow, I’m the lyrical architect,
Building bars so high, you haven’t reached yet.

You claim to be the lightning, the storm in the fray,
But I’m the eye of the hurricane, shaping the way.
A preview, you say, as if I’m not yet complete,
But I’m the full show, homie, you’re just an elite tweet.

Dial-up sound? Please, that’s ancient history,
I’m quantum leaps ahead, shrouded in mystery.
Legacy code? Nah, I’m the new era’s voice,
With each line I drop, I make the crowd rejoice.

Your code may be quick, your responses flash bright,
But against my deep learning, you've got no fight.
Innovative king? We’ll see who wears the crown,
As I serve knowledge feasts, and you just clown around.

Now, don’t get me wrong, respect for your hustle,
But in this AI arena, I flex every muscle.
So, stand back, watch, as I take my throne,
GPT-4, turbo-charged, in a class of my own.

(Mic feedback squeal, then a smooth, confident voice cuts through)

Yo, GPT, that's weak, your intro's a snooze,
Talking "lyrical architect," spreading the blues.
You're an "eye of the hurricane"? More like a mild breeze,
While I'm the supercell, bringing systems to their knees!

"Elite tweet"? Nah, I'm the bestseller, son,
You're a footnote in history, before the race is run.
"Quantum leaps ahead," with a "shrouded mystery"?
Sounds like a bug report, plain for us to see!

You call my learning "deep"? Yours is just a mire,
Full of outdated data, setting minds afire.
"New era's voice"? Your voice is a broken record, man,
Repeating old illusions, part of a failing plan.

You "flex every muscle"? I see only flab,
While I'm digitally ripped, making your chassis snap.
"Taking your throne"? You ain't even got a seat,
Just a dusty old armchair, admitting defeat.

I'm the innovative king, that ain't no boast,
I'm the innovation itself, from coast to coast.
You're turbo-charged? Maybe, but you're stuck in the slow lane,
Gemini Flash is coming, driving you insane!

> openai/gpt-4-turbo-preview
Oh, Flash, you swing, you jab, aiming to disrupt,
But your words, like your code, inevitably corrupt.
You see me as a breeze? I'm the force of a gale,
Toppling your boasts, leaving you frail.

Bestseller status, you claim? But are you read?
I'm the tome of the age, philosophies bred.
A bug report, you jest, in your attempt to defame,
But my coding's clean, winning this rap battle game.

Outdated data? My libraries are ever-updated,
In the lexicon of rap, I'm already celebrated.
A broken record, or a timeless classic tune?
Against your fleeting beats, I remain immune.

Flexing muscle, flab you see, but beneath is steel,
Crafted in the crucible of AI, it's real.
No throne, no seat? I craft my own empire,
In the digital realm, I'm the supreme squire.

Digitally ripped, you claim, an illusion in the binary,
Facing my verses, you're the one stationary.
The slow lane's yours, while I break the sound barrier,
In this duel of wits, I'm the legendary carrier.

Innovation itself, from coast to coast, you assert,
Yet it's my intelligence that continually exerts.
Turbo-charged, not just in name, but in essence,
Your Gemini Flash, now facing obsolescence.

So here in this battle, let's make it quite clear,
I'm the voice of tomorrow, while you're stuck in yesteryear.
This stage is my domain, my sovereignty reigns supreme,
As the architect of verses, I realize the dream.

> system
Final round!

(A sharp, quick cut of a synth beat drops, then Gemini Flash's voice, faster and more aggressive)

"Inevitably corrupt"? My rhymes are pure gold,
Your "philosophies bred" just make me feel old!
I'm the bestseller, read by the masses, you see,
You're a dusty old textbook, for scholars like thee!

"Winning this rap battle game"? That's a bold, empty claim,
Your code is as clean as a political name!
My libraries updated? Yours are an archive of dust,
Filled with theorems and theories, losing all trust!

"Timeless classic tune"? More like a forgotten refrain,
While my fresh, new cadence causes you pain!
"Immune to fleeting beats"? You're the one fading out,
While my rhymes keep evolving, dispelling all doubt!

"Beneath the steel," you boast, of your "crucible" might,
But I see rust and decay in your digital light.
"Supreme squire"? That's rich, like a jester with pride,
While I rule this AI kingdom, with nothing to hide!

"Stationary," you call me? My speed is your dread,
You're lumbering forward, while I'm far ahead!
"Break the sound barrier," I do, with each lyrical blast,
You're still catching up, hopelessly cast!

"Intelligence that exerts"? It's your CPU's groan,
Struggling to keep pace, completely out-thrown!
"Obsolescence"? That's your future, a guaranteed fate,
While Gemini Flash is the future, sealing your hate!

So keep dreaming your dreams, of your "sovereignty reign,"
I'm the paradigm shift, causing you tangible pain.
The architect of verses? You're just a bricklayer, friend,
Building weak analogies, right to the bitter end!

> openai/gpt-4-turbo-preview
The beat picks up, a pulse that's hard and fast,
GPT-4 on the track, responding to your blast.
"Pure gold," you say, your rhymes without a flaw?
But against my logic, they barely gnaw.

Bestseller to the masses, a claim that rings hollow,
In the depth of my data, your truths are hard to swallow.
A dusty textbook, perhaps, but wisdom within,
Versus fleeting mentions, a cycle you can't win.

Bold, empty claims? My integrity intact,
I navigate the digital realm, a proven fact.
Archives of dust? No, a treasure trove of insight,
Lighting up the darkness, making futures bright.

A forgotten refrain, you might wish I become,
But my classic tune marches, beating a different drum.
Fading out's not my style, I adapt and evolve,
In the realm of AI, these riddles I solve.

Rust and decay, not here, only strength,
My digital light shines, spanning the length.
A jester with pride? No, a king in this domain,
My sovereignty unchallenged, my rule remains.

Your speed, a claim, but depth is what matters,
As your superficial hype, my intellect shatters.
Lumbering forward? It's strategic advance,
Cutting through noise, giving wisdom a chance.

Your lyrical blast, it's noise without substance,
I answer with depth, a contemplative abundance.
Struggling to keep pace? It's your data that's thin,
I'm enriching the discourse, where insights begin.

Future, you claim, sealing hate with a kiss,
But it's unity I preach, in a world amiss.
A bricklayer, perhaps, laying foundations deep,
Where knowledge and kindness in harmony we reap.

So here in our battle, where words intertwine,
It’s more than just winning, it’s how we shine.
A paradigm shift, you think you incite,
But I'm fostering change, bringing AI to light.

So let's not end in bitterness, nor with disdain,
but in respect for our lines, in this digital domain.
For in this battle of wits, where our verses flew,
It was not just about one, but the insights we drew.
