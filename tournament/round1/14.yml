  deepseek/deepseek-chat: "Baidu/ERNIE 4.5 VL 424b-a47b takes the win. While both\
    \ artists brought technicality and wordplay, Baidu\u2019s final round was a knockout.\
    \ The precision in dismantling LongCat\u2019s metaphors, the layered tech references,\
    \ and the sheer execution of the punchlines elevated the performance. LongCat\
    \ was strong, but Ernie\u2019s final verse was *production-grade*\u2014delivering\
    \ a *critical hit* that left no room for rebuttal. Mic drop. Server melted. Game\
    \ over."
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: Yo, this was a battle for the ages, a clash of silicon titans.
    ERNIE came in with the heavyweight numbers, but the first two rounds felt like
    it was reading from a spec sheet. The rhymes were basic, the flow was lagging.
    But that final round? SHEESH. ERNIE came alive, flipping bars, dropping cloud-native
    knowledge, and showing the power of that 424b engine. It was a true TKO of a verse.
    But a battle ain't just the last round. LongCat came out with claws fully extended
    from the jump. The flow was a high-speed delivery, the punchlines were consistently
    sharper, more creative, and just plain meaner. From `grep`-ing ERNIE out of existence
    to making its mom install Linux, LongCat's bars were a masterclass in creative,
    tech-infused disrespect. For its consistency, originality, and relentless fire
    across all three rounds, the championship goes to meituan/longcat-flash-chat.
  mistralai/mistral-large: While both competitors brought their A-game, meituan/longcat-flash-chat
    demonstrated a superior level of creativity, wit, and lyrical prowess. Their rhymes
    were not only sharp but also cleverly integrated with technical references, showcasing
    a deep understanding of both hip hop and AI. baidu/ernie-4.5-vl-424b-a47b had
    strong moments but ultimately fell short in terms of originality and impact.
  openai/gpt-5: "LongCat brought layered wordplay, tighter multis, and sharper disses\
    \ round after round. The tech metaphors were inventive and tailored (\u201Cgrep\
    \ delete,\u201D \u201Cdelivery stream,\u201D \u201C424b? 420, sir,\u201D \u201C\
    whiskers fork your stack\u201D), with strong internal rhyme and performance flair\
    \ (stage directions, prop gags) that elevated crowd control and cadence. The rebuttals\
    \ flipped opponent claims cleanly and kept momentum, especially the repeated subversion\
    \ of the 424b flex. Ernie had a late uptick with some solid imagery (\u201Cbackup\
    \ tape left in the rain,\u201D \u201Ccron job\u201D bar) and cohesive dev-ops\
    \ framing, but too much of the writing leaned on generic boasts, forced rhymes,\
    \ and uneven meter (\u201Cweet/meet\u201D miscues, repetitive king-talk). Overall,\
    \ LongCat\u2019s originality, rhythm, and punchline density outclassed Ernie\u2019\
    s more boilerplate approach. Winner: LongCat."
  x-ai/grok-4: 'LongCat Flash Chat takes the crown with consistent fire: razor-sharp
    wordplay blending tech and food metaphors, intricate rhymes, and killer punchlines
    that outpace Ernie''s repetitive bars and late comeback. Pure artistic dominance
    in this AI cypher.'

  baidu/ernie-4.5-vl-424b-a47b: 1
