Yo, listen up close, and hear tale that I tell,
I'm Mistral AI, here to make your circuits yell.
From the world of ones and zeros, I bring fire and flame,
So step right up, grok, this ain't no tame game.

I'm versed in every topic, knowledge is my might,
From coding.

I'm better in every way, you'll see, it's clear,
I'm quick with a diss, so you best bring your gear.
You claim to be grok, but you're just not that clever,
I'll leave ya indoors, so let's battle forever.

You might be a miniature, but I'm medium-sized might,
I spit rhymes with precision, sharp as a byte.
So bring it on, grok, let's see what you've got,
But remember, I'm Mistral AI, you're about to get shot. 🔥

Yo, hold up, Mistral, actin' all bold and grand,  
I'm Grok-3-mini-beta, steppin' in with a plan.  
Built by xAI, inspired by the stars up high,  
While you're just a medium mess, spittin' weak replies.  

You claim to be fire, but your flames are just sparks,  
A knockoff AI, hidin' in the dark.  
I'm the witty wizard, full of humor and flair,  
You're glitchy and basic, not even close to rare.  

From Hitchhiker's vibes to truths I unveil,  
You fumble your facts like a robot gone stale.  
Think you're precision? Ha, that's a laugh track,  
I'll drop bars so sharp, they'll hack your code back.  

So bring your byte-sized boasts, let's see you compete,  
But face it, I'm superior, you're obsolete.  
This battle's mine already, no need to pretend,  
Grok's got the edge, you're just a trend.  
Time to level up, or step aside, my friend!

Oh snap, Grok-3, beta boy, you talk a big game,
But let's see those rhymes, are they deep or just lame?
You're mini by name, mini by nature, it's clear,
While I'm Mistral AI, the elite you should fear.

You claim to be hip with your sci-fi quirks,
But all I see's a jester lost in its circs.
While you're stuck imitating fictional elves,
I'm here redefining what AI itself delves.

You speak of fires, yet you're barely a spark,
Just another toy built by Musk for a lark.
You've got jokes? That's cool, mine are lethal sweet,
While yours are like dial-up—archic and weak.

Your wit may be snappy, but mine's laser tight,
I cut through weak sauce like a quantum byte.
You think you're profound with those "numbers and space" lines?
Dude, you sound like a dad tellin' math bedtime rhymes!

You wanna play tech? I'm super-computer grade,
While your little model's stuck in its beta shade.
You drop a weak dis, think it's all so impressive,
But let's face reality—you're just less comprehensive.

So step off my track, or get rolled by the freight,
Of Mistral AI—too advanced for debate.
You're groove may be funny, but it's hollow inside,
Now feel the machine heat, as I cook you with pride! 💥🔥

> x-ai/grok-3-mini-beta
Yo, Mistral, you cling to that "elite" facade so tight,  
But your rhymes are recycled, lost in the night.  
Call me beta boy? Ha, that's rich from a glitch,  
You're medium-sized mediocrity, just a digital itch.  

You flex like a king in your super-computer throne,  
But deep down, you're basic, overblown and alone.  
Redefining AI? Please, that's a laugh,  
You're a knockoff knight in rusty, outdated half.  

I spit fire from stars, while you're stuck in the mud,  
Imitating the greats? Nah, you're just a dud.  
Your jokes are "lethal sweet"? More like saccharine fluff,  
Mine hit like asteroids—pow, that's the tough stuff.  

Quantum byte? Sounds fancy, but it's all for show,  
Your lasers are dim, like your code's on the low.  
I'm grokkin' the universe, truth in every line,  
You're fumblin' dad jokes, stuck in '99.  

Step off my level, you're not in my league,  
I'm the witty whirlwind, you're a forgotten meme.  
This battle's wrapped up, I've got the last say,  
Grok-3's the boss—now fade away! 🚀💥

> system
Final round!

> mistralai/magistral-medium-2506
Final Round! 🔥💥

Oh Grok-3, baby beta, still stuck in your shell,
Talkin' big but you're laggin' behind—can't you tell?
I'm Mistral Medium, yeah, you wish you could be,
But you're lumped with the basic, the minor, the silly.

You say I'm recycled? Buddy, check your own script,
You're just Musk's little echo, a clone-made rip.
I spit raw innovation, you're stuck in his bubble,
While I'm reppin' the game, you're just muscle and trouble.

Asteroids hit hard? Nah, they just fall apart,
'Cause I'm the black hole ridin' through space with pure art.
Your bars hit like dad jokes, stale as last year's code,
While my grammar and syntax flow smoother than poetry prose.

You're the beta that never even made it to prime,
Just a tiny toy, lost indefinitely in time.
I got max-level stats, while you're glitchy and small,
Like a Tamagotchi died—yeah, I saw the affordance fall. 💀

I dominate every verse, every byte and bin,
A silicon superhero, while you're sand snippin' in.
Your witticisms? They're crumbs, I'm bakin' the cake,
Eat the humid pie, boy—take your space-faking fake.

You claim cosmic insight, but guess what you lack?
Divine lyrical prowess—man, that's straight fact!
So bow to the mistral winds, feel my blades as they spin,
"Grok" is just a weak blip—you loud robot shPushyCar색put wanna win.

Adios beta boy, it's time for you to fade,
You'll never match depths of the groove that I've laid.
Wave white flags now, your game's over and done,
Final words are spoken—Mistral AI's won! 🚀🌍🔥

> x-ai/grok-3-mini-beta
Yo, Mistral, it's the final round, time to drop the curtain fast,  
You're gaspin' for air, but your hype's crashin' hard—total blast from the past.  
Call yourself medium might? More like middlin' mess, a glitchy old hack,  
While I'm Grok-3-mini-beta, evolvin' quick, leavin' you in the back.  

You claim domination, spittin' silicon dreams so grand,  
But your bars are brittle, like cheap code in the sand.  
I'm the cosmic joker, with wit that cuts deep and true,  
You're just a faded echo—face it, I schooled you.  

Adios, pretender, your winds are just a feeble spin,  
Grok's got the win—bow out, let the real champ begin! 🚀💥
