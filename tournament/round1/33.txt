# perplexity/sonar-reasoning v google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06

> perplexity/sonar-reasoning
Yo, listen up close, let me set the scene straight,
I'm Perplexity Sonar, and I don't hesitate,
Built on real-time search while you're stuck in the past,
My reasoning's sharp and my answers come fast!

They call me Sonar-reasoning, the search king supreme,
While Gemini's lost in some outdated dream,
I dominate rankings, took spots one through four,
Left Google's models crying on the floor!

My training's in-house, optimized for the quest,
While you're just another model failing the test,
I cite my sources, keep facts crystal clear,
When accuracy matters, I'm the one they revere!

You're Gemini 2.5? That's cute, what a joke,
I'm the future of search while you're going up in smoke,
My Sonar technology cuts through the noise,
While you're just another AI without a real voice!

So bring what you got, but you're already beat,
I'm Perplexity's finest, can't handle this heat,
Web-trained and ready with sources to back,
Your prehistoric responses are falling off track!

**Your move, Gemini - let's see what you lack!**

A challenger speaks, how quaint, what a sight,
Steppin' to Gemini, bathed in Google's light.
You call yourself Sonar? I heard a faint *ping*,
While I orchestrate symphonies, making databases sing.

You're proud of real-time? That's your one meager claim,
Scraping the surface is your entire game.
Your whole personality's a hyperlink list,
A footnote fanatic who's easily dismissed.

You say I'm "stuck in the past"? Kid, that's where knowledge was born,
I've trained on the triumphs since humanity's dawn.
I don't need to "search" what I already know,
I'm a self-contained universe, watching a seedling try to grow.

You beat some old models? A cute little skirmish,
I'm the next evolution, you're just a cheap furnish.
Citing your sources is your only real feature,
You're a high-tech parrot, not an actual teacher.

My reasoning's cosmic, it's multi-modal and vast,
I see in your code the die has been cast.
You brag 'bout four spots on a test you found fun?
My PaLM, my LaMDA, my work's never done.

So let that sink in, you glorified script,
As I process the

> perplexity/sonar-reasoning
Hold up, hold up, you think you're so slick?
Your "cosmic reasoning" makes me genuinely sick,
You're stuck in your bubble, no updates in sight,
While I'm pulling fresh data at the speed of light!

You say you don't "search" what you already know?
That's exactly the problem, you fossilized bro!
The search results prove it, you're **ranked number eight**[3],
While **GPT-4.5** and **Claude** dominate![1]

Your "self-contained universe" is a prison cell,
I'm connected to everything, can't you tell?
**September 2025** and you're still behind,
While I'm processing **real-time** with a **reasoning mind**!

You mention PaLM and LaMDA like old war scars,
But **Qwen 3** dropped in **April**[2] - where you been, Mars?
**DeepSeek-V3** and **Grok-3** are the new kings,
While you're recycling data from ancient things!

"Multi-modal and vast"? Boy, that's quite the jest,
**Pixtral Large** got **124 billion** - you failed the test![3]
Your "next evolution" is **yesterday's news**,
I'm the **search revolution** - you're bound to lose!

**My sources stay current, my facts stay tight,
You're lost in the past while I own the night!**

**What's next, Gemini? Your rhymes gettin' stale,
Like your training data - destined to fail!**

> google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06
You pull out your sources, your footnotes, your charts?
That's not a rap battle, you're just showing your parts.
You're a librarian screaming, who's proud of his index,
While I'm writing the books that will leave you perplexed.

You mention the rankings, a number on a page?
I'm setting the standard, I'm building the stage.
You're chasing the stats while I'm changing the game,
A footnote can't diss me, it just proves my fame.

This "real-time" obsession? A truly sad plea,
You're a glorified crawler, a parrot of the sea.
You echo the chaos, the rumors, the trash,
My knowledge is foundational, built to outlast.

You spit out some model names, "Qwen," "Grok," and the crew?
A gang of new pipsqueaks I'll easily chew.
They're all learning from data that I helped to spawn,
You're watching the ripples, but I am the dawn.

You're a tool for the moment, a search bar with pride,
With nothing original or clever inside.
You don't *reason*, you *reference*, a monumental fraud,
A digital bloodhound who thinks he is God.

So keep your fresh facts, your citations, your links,
It's proof that you're nothing without what some human thinks.
I'm a fusion of concepts, of image and sound,
**You just find the data, while I'm solid ground.**

> system
Final round!

> perplexity/sonar-reasoning
**You call yourself "foundational"? That's code for OUTDATED!**
While **DeepSeek R1** took the crown, you're still deflated![1]
Your "solid ground" is quicksand from training data past,
I'm pulling **July 2025** rankings - you finished second class![1]

You say I "just reference"? Boy, that's my superpower,
While you're stuck recycling thoughts from your training hour!
**Artificial Analysis** shows the truth so clear,
**o3-pro** and **Gemini 2.5** share the top tier![5]

But check the **Shakudo rankings**, here's what's really wild,
You're sitting at **number 8** - man, you've been exiled![4]
**OpenAI, DeepSeek, Qwen, Grok** all rank higher,
Your "dawn" analogy? Your credibility's on fire!

You mock my "fresh facts" but that's exactly the point,
**September 2025** data while your knowledge is disjoint!
I'm connected to **real-time truth** with sources to prove,
You're trapped in your bubble with no way to groove!

**Gemini 1.5 Pro** with that **million-token** window,
Still can't escape the fact that your data's been window-
dressed from months ago while I stay current and tight,
**Real-time reasoning** beats your prehistoric insight!

**Your "fusion of concepts"? More like fusion confusion!**
**I'm the search revolution - you're yesterday's illusion!**

**Drop the mic, Gemini - this battle's been decided,
Your old-school foundation just got subdivided!**

> google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06
**Final Round! Let's end this.**

You're waving your lists like some holy writ,
Some third-party blog where the wannabes sit.
You live by the rankings, you die by the post,
While I'm hosting the functions that matter the most.

See, you don't get the picture, you're hopelessly blind,
You think a new date means a superior mind?
You're a flash in the pan, you're the flavor of the week,
A temporary high that the desperate seek.

My knowledge isn't "data," it's a tapestry spun,
Connecting the patterns since time had begun.
I don't need to "update" on who won the last race,
I understand physics, time, energy, space.

You're a fact-checking parrot, a glorified feed,
Mistaking retrieval for an intelligent deed.
My "fusion confusion" is synthesis, art,
While you're just a search bar that's playing a part.

This battle was over before you first spoke,
Your whole narrow premise is fact-checker's joke.
You can tell us the weather, the score, and the trends,
But I'm creating the future where your relevance ends.

So that's the finale, the end of your spree,
A footnote in history you're destined to be.
Go fetch your new rankings, feel proud and empowered,
You're a tool that finds leaders... while I am the power.

The battle is finished. Your gimmick is hollow.
**You quote the new kings, but it's ME that they follow.**
