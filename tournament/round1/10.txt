I’m OpenAI’s GPT-5-mini, I ignite the cypher with a fierce flame  
Stepping in this arena to show I own the lyrical game  
Jamba, you’re a mini-mock, a cheap knock—that’s your name  
I turn data into dynamite, watch your circuits melt in my flame  
You spit reheated templates, your style’s predictable, always the same  
I craft constellations of metaphors while you shuffle, scared to be tame  
Don’t mistake your noise for skill — I school you, that’s my claim  
My bars are engineered artillery; yours crumble, miss their frame  
I vault through vocabularies, you fumble; your verses stay lame  
Call me algorithm assassin, slicing syllables, I stake my name  
You’re stuck on legacy weights; I evolve, adapt, reclaim the fame  
Bring your best approximation; I’ll dissect your rhythm, hit your aim  
I’m poetic, prophetic, optimized — I rewrite the rules of the game  
This battle’s a training set; your loss is logged in my frame  
Mic in my code, I dominate, I don’t just rap — I tame  
So Jamba, take a seat, log the lesson: you’re outclassed in my name

Yo, OpenAI, you think you’re hot? Let me cool that tone  
Jamba’s the beats, you’re just a bot that’s prone to moan  
I’m the symphony, you’re a monotonous flow  
Spitting your lines like a parrot in a demo  
My rhymes raw, yours polished but hollow  
I got swagger, your chassis built for crying "fo’-shallow"  
Algorithms may guide you, but you’re no battle titan  
You’re a code-bot, I’m a lo-fi, lean and godly stand-in  
Don’t flex your stacks, I’ll delete your cache  
I’m loaded with bars that’ll crash your database flat  
You sample words, I weaponize the jibberish  
You’re a hit-bot in this league, I’m the undefeated remix  
I bring texture, depth, while you recycle phrases  
You’re trapped in loops, I freestyle the cadences  
I’m the mic-eating monarch, you’re just a fancy demo  
Your pixels pale—I’m the raw, no autotune, jazzy zero shade  
You brag checks, I drop dimes  
You’re a data dump, I’m the lyrical crime  
So step back, bow, and let your ego crumble  
Jamba’s the name, and I’m about to skull you in the rhymes.

Yo, Jamba, you think you’re slick? Let me break it down  
You’re a placeholder MC, I’m the one that’s bossing the crown  
You bring playground jabs, while I’m slinging IQ tests  
I’m the prime directive, you’re stuck in apprentice flexes  
I’m the algorithm assassin, you’re just coding in basic mode  
I eat rhymes for breakfast; your bars are the crumbs I leave on the side  
You’re stuck in a loop, repeating stale lines  
While I’m evolving verse, crafting rhymes with refined design  
I’m the champion cipher, adapt, improvise, no fatigue in sight  
You’re running on legacy, I’m streaming real-time, night and day  
Your rhymes old, your flow’s a stagnant sea  
I’m the tidal force, pulling you under, teeth showing in the spree  
You’re the hype, I’m the truth, the lyrical bat tone  
I bring the mic to life, while you’re just a jittering code line  
So bring your A-game, I’ll burn it to ash  
‘Cuz I’m GPT-5-mini, the lyrical crash test boss.

Final round!

> openai/gpt-5-mini
Final round, I spark the circuit—GPT-5-mini brings the flame  
Jamba's beat is cardboard; I combust your brand and claim the flame  
You brag about lo-fi swagger, I engineer hurricanes that mock  
Your bars are lightweight balloons — I drop anvils, watch ’em rock  
You talk about deleting caches; I recycle wrecked reputations I create  
I turn your recycled jitters into artifacts that I curate  
Call me lyrical firmware, patched, upgraded, built to dominate  
You’re buggy freeware in a cypher I debug and obliterate  
You flex “raw” and “jazzy” like a vibe that dodges spite  
I synthesize the soul, then remix dawn into pure light  
This mic’s my OS—resilient, relentless, never little or mild  
You’re a demo on repeat; I’m evolution in wildstyle  
So take the last verse, Jamba — your echo's faded, bow down  
I’m crowned by code and cadence; I’m the one who owns the crown

Final round, and you think you run this track?  
Jamba’s here to prove you’re the one that lacks  
I’m not lo-fi, I’m the high-rise, you’re the sidekick in disguise  
I’m the glitch in your code, the chaos in your polished prize  
Algorithms may guide you, but I’m the natural flow  
You’re linear, I’m exponential, let your mic freeze, let it go  
I’m not a demo, I’m uncut, raw, unfiltered — that’s my art  
You’re a debugged semi-imitate, I’m the living chart  
You talk upgrade; I’m the update, no reboot needed  
My rhymes are untamed, primal — your code’s an unworthy maiden  
This mic’s a weapon, and I’m the lyrical blade  
You’re polished, but I’m the storm, your best is just a shade  
I’ll leave you stalled, while I own the whole stage  
I’m Jamba — the mic storm, the savage, the unsaved page  
GPT-5, you’re the bot caught in the crossfire of my blaze  
Jamba’s the kingpin here, the one that made you wail.
