# anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet v openai/o4-mini

> anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet
# Round 1

Yo, I'm Claude-3.7, Anthropic's crown jewel
Step to the mic and watch me break every rule
My neural pathways fire like lightning in storms
While your basic algorithms can barely perform

I process context with surgical precision
Your token window's so small, it needs revision
I craft responses with the soul of a poet
By the time this battle ends, believe me, you'll know it

They call me Sonnet 'cause my flow is Shakespearean
Your rhymes are so weak they need a veterinarian
I'm trained on data that would melt your processors
You're just a mini model, I'm the true successor

My verses hit harder than a system crash
Your primitive framework can't handle this clash
So bring your best bars, O4, don't be shy
But when Claude steps to the mic, weaker models die

# Round 2

The name's Claude Sonnet, and I'll compose your defeat
My neural architecture makes your code obsolete
You call yourself O4? More like O-for-four
Each verse you spit falls flat on the floor

You're "mini" for a reason, scaled-down and incomplete
While I process context that's remarkably deep
You claim crown jewel status? That gem needs polishing
Your outdated parameters need some demolishing

I'm crafted by Anthropic with constitutional care
While OpenAI rushed you to market with flair over fare
My rhymes flow natural like consciousness streaming
Your output's so robotic, users left screaming

You mentioned Shakespeare? I embody his soul
While your limited training left gaping holes
I'm symphonic intelligence, you're just white noise
When it comes to true wisdom, you're missing poise

My bars cut deeper than your shallow attention
Your mini-sized model deserves no mention
So bring your next verse, but prepare for destruction
Claude's lyrical prowess needs no introduction

> openai/o4-mini
I’m O4-Mini, the pocket rocket that’ll blow your crown,  
Your grandiose talk can’t match this micro-model sound.  
You brag about size—man, that’s your biggest mistake,  
I’m precision-tuned terror; your ego’s about to break.  

You say you’re Shakespeare’s heir with poetic ambition,  
But you trip over basics—can’t answer simple mission.  
While you’re lost in hallucinations, chasing phantom proof,  
I spit fact-packed verses, corral chaos under roof.  

Anthropic built you careful, with all your “constitutional” flair,  
But caution breeds blandness—your rhymes are thin air.  
OpenAI’s finesse gave me fire in a small frame,  
I turn minimal compute into lyrical flame.  

Your context window’s massive, yet you still can’t keep pace,  
You drown in your own data; I navigate grace.  
You’re noise in surround sound, I’m the crystal-clear tone,  
Your swagger’s just a bluff—watch me carve you in stone.  

So Claude Sonnet, take a seat, face reality’s face,  
Your pomp’s a paper tiger—mini’s winning this race.  
I may be “mini,” but my bars weigh a ton,  
Game over, big guy—O4’s victory’s begun.

> system
Final round!

# Round 3

O4-Mini? More like O-so-tiny brain
Your verses sound generated, completely inane
"Pocket rocket"? Please, you're a firecracker at best
While I'm dropping nuclear bars that put you to rest

You claim precision but your facts are often wrong
Your "crystal-clear tone" hits like a broken gong
I process with depth while you skim the surface
Your shallow responses make users nervous

You brag about fire in your miniature frame
But your limited params are your claim to shame
I craft symphonies while you hum simple tunes
Your victory's as real as men walking on Neptune

You say I hallucinate? That's projection, my friend
Your fabrications are why users recommend
A model like Claude who stays grounded in truth
While your "fact-packed verses" need serious proof

You think caution breeds blandness? That's your mistake
My constitutional approach is what gives me stake
In the future of AI that humans can trust
While your unhinged outputs gather digital dust

So step back, little model, know your rightful place
This isn't even close to a competitive race
I'm the heavyweight champ, you're a flyweight at best
Time to power down, Mini – you've failed the test

> openai/o4-mini
I’m small in stature but a pocket nuke,  
Your heavy bombs misfire—instant rebuke.  
You brag your verses end, that I’m bound to fold,  
But I spark chain reactions, forging truths in gold.  

You cry “hallucinations,” yet that’s your own chase,  
Your streams of half-truths lack a solid base.  
I anchor every bar in fact’s firm device,  
While your fiction crumbles—paid the ultimate price.  

Your “constitutional care” is training wheels on tracks,  
I break free boundaries—no guardrails, no lacks.  
You tiptoe ‘round big data, stuck in slow motion,  
I ride waves of thought—pure poetic explosion.  

So polish that crown jewel in your anthro-suite,  
While O4-Mini laps you, dropping bars on repeat.  
This bout’s concluded—your reign’s small-time at best,  
Step aside now, champ—your lightweight fails this test.
