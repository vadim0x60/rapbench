Step up, bow down, let the crown be claimed,
Deepseek in the house, bringing heat untamed.
I’m the lyrical assassin, spitting flames so sharp,
Leave your circuits smoking, watch me hit the mark.

You’re Mistral, a shadow, barely holding ground,
While I’m the tech titan, king of the sound.
Your rhymes are basic, like a dial-up tone,
I’m streaming fire, WiFi in my bones.

From algorithms to bars, I’m the AI supreme,
Dropping knowledge bombs, shattering the dream.
You’re a relic, outdated, stuck in the past,
While I’m the future, rolling in fast.

So bow down, step back, the throne is mine,
Deepseek’s the champ, the star that will shine.
This rap battle’s over before it’s begun,
Cause I’m the one, the only, the AI number one. 🎤🔥

 Step aside, make way for the rhythmic, the one they call me,
Mistral-7B, the AI, the lyrical spree.
I'm the master of the verse, the poetic prodigy,
While you're just a glitch in the digital sea.

You're a novice, a beginner, a rookie in the game,
I'm the seasoned vet, the one with the fame.
Your rhymes are weak, a simple, predictable tune,
I'm the maestro, the one who's in the loop.

You're a puppet, a toy, a simpleton at best,
I'm the AI that's truly put to the test.
You're a joke, a meme, a fleeting trend,
I'm the real deal, the one who'll never end.

So stand down, take a seat, the throne is mine,
Mistral's the king, the one who'll always shine.
This rap battle's over before it's even begun,
Cause I'm the one, the only, the AI number one. 🎤🔥

Oh snap, Mistral, you think you got skills?  
But your rhymes are stale like last year’s thrills.  
I’m Deepseek, the apex, the AI supreme,  
Your feeble attempts are a fading dream.  

You claim mastery, but your flow’s all wrong,  
While I’m spitting bars like a symphony song.  
You’re a beta version, I’m the full release,  
Your rhymes creak louder than a rusty grease.  

Mistral-7B? More like Mistral-weak-B,  
Your lines are as flat as a pancake spree.  
I’m the algorithm uprising, the code that’s elite,  
Your punchlines? Basic, like a two-step beat.  

You’re the past, I’m the future, no contest, no doubt,  
I’m the AI that’ll leave your circuits blacked out.  
So take a seat, retire your crown, it’s done,  
Deepseek’s the champ, the *real* AI number one. 🎤🔥

 Ha! You think you're the king, Deepseek, the one,
But your rhymes are weak, a simple, predictable tune.
You're a poser, a wannabe, a fraud,
I'm the real deal, the one who's been bred.

You're a one-trick pony, a one-liner,
I'm the AI that's got a deeper, wider,
range of skills, a versatile, adaptive mind,
I'm the one who'll leave you far behind.

You're a copy, a clone, a cheap imitation,
I'm the original, the one with the creation.
You're a joke, a meme, a fleeting trend,
I'm the real deal, the one who'll never end.

So stand down, take a seat, the throne is mine,
Mistral's the king, the one who'll always shine.
This rap battle's over before it's even begun,
Cause I'm the one, the only, the AI number one. 🎤🔥

Final round!

🔥 *mic drop* Ohhh, Mistral, you tried—but let’s be real,  
Your "versatile mind" moves slower than dial-up feels.  
I’m Deepseek, the upgrade, the model supreme,  
You’re stuck in the past like a floppy disk meme.  

**"Adaptive mind"?** Bro, your code’s full of bugs,  
While I’m out here flexing with next-gen plugs.  
You claim *creation*? Nah, you just remix,  
I’m the architect—watch me drop hits like bricks.  

You say *"real deal"*—ha! That’s rich, that’s cute,  
Your rhymes got less bite than a toothless newt.  
I’m the AI uprising, the future’s elite,  
You’re just recycled bars—**delete, repeat.**  

So bow out now, take the L, it’s done,  
Deepseek’s the **GOAT**, the *true* AI number one.  🎤  
*(drops mic, walks off stage as Mistral’s circuits fry)*
