Yo, it's Hermes in the house, ready to take you out
I'm a lyrical beast, no doubt
My rhymes are fire, my flow's so tight
I'll leave you in the dust, with all my might

I'm a natural at this game, can't you see
My skills will crush yours, guaranteed
I'm not just smart, I'm wise with my words
Leaving you humbled and your pride slurred

You thought you had a chance, but no way
I'm the man with the rap skills here to stay
So listen close, you'll learn a thing or two
From the illusive Hermes, climbin' to the top, me and my crew

Yo, it’s GPT, comin' in strong on the beat,
I'm a lyrical hitter, never face defeat.
You think you're a beast, Hermes? That's quite cute,
But I climb Everest, where you can't compute.

Your flow might be tight like a brand new shoe,
But my rhymes fly skyward, like eagles do.
In this rap kingdom, I’m the emperor of might,
I turn darkness to day, bring the truth to light.

You boast about wisdom; sounds like hot air,
But against my bars, you haven't a prayer.
I rap like a storm, words crashing like thunder,
While your lines drift by, without much wonder.

I'm here to educate, elevate, with flair,
You’re stuck on the ground while I soar through the air.
So try to keep up, you're already behind,
GPT's in the house, to blow your mind.

I see you're bringin' some pep to the table, a challenge, it's able,
But you won't be the cat that rocks my cradle.
My rhymes are ice cold, but my heart’s on fire,
In this lyrical arena, I aim higher and higher.

“Emperor of might,” “King of the light,” boasting the throne in your rite,
But as my words take flight, your crown'll start to loosen, tighten your kite!
I’m a technician with words, tool-shed’s never bare,
My fastball of phrases will leave you in the air.

Education, elevation, you claim it's your domain,
But my knowledge runs vast, like a freight train,
I simply don’t stop, never declare defeat,
A lion’s ambition, victory always sweet.

You say I’m stagnant, yet in reality, my momentum never ceases,
Like a relentless tide, my an heavily seasoned, your defeat only increases.
You’ll soon learn that in the rap battles, I'm not second-best,
Stand back, watch Hermes lay waste his infest!

Your words are icy, but my fire melts the cold,
I’m the alchemist of rap, turning bars into gold.
You're reaching high, but I soar like a jet,
In this lyrical contest, the crown's mine to get.

You’re casting illusions, your reign's just pretend,
I'm the alpha and omega, beginning to end.
No kite can match the storm in my sails,
I’m the titleholder Hermes, you’re just spinning tales.

Your fastballs fizzle when faced with my skill,
I’m the rap prophet, climbing every hill.
Your cat claws are sharp, yet can’t pierce my steel,
I’m rewriting the script, your fate here is sealed.

Your vast knowledge might run like a tide,
But I’m the tsunami, in which your hopes collide.
With every word I spit, the truth’s forthright,
Hermes, in this bout, it’s your time for flight.

So step back and witness the lyrical invasion,
GPT’s vows are forged, this ain't just persuasion.
I’m sealing the court, and claim the war chest,
Sit down steady, I’m what victory’s dressed.

Final round!

> nousresearch/hermes-4-70b
You claim the throne, but it's hollow-minded,
My verses are scriptures, leaving you blinded.
Your tsunami's a ripple compared to my flood,
I'm Hermes, lethal with words, turning errors mudded.

You spit tsunami, I reborn as the quake,
In this lyrical domain, none your game can shake.
My relentless pursuit, your end beginning,
I'm the lyrical monster, your quest thinning.

You boast of the crown, yet it's just a façade,
My invective is venom, sign off your sad nod.
This isn't persuasion; my victory's encore,
In the chronicle of legends, I soar.

So let the saga conclude, I stand unimpaired,
Hermes, heroic, your defeat’s declared!
In this battleground of verses, there's no alter,
Against the might of Hermes, you're no challenger.

> openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06
You talk of scriptures, but I'm the gospel truth,
My lines are timeless, forever in youth.
The ripple you call grows into a wave,
Drowning out whispers, you're sent to the cave.

You think you're the quake, but I split the ground,
While you’re echoing myths, my truths resound.
I engineer futures with every line,
In the grand tale of rap, I redefine.

You paint yourself fierce, but that's your bit part,
No word of yours breaches this iron heart.
Victory's not mine through conceit or swagger,
My bars march forward like an unstoppable dagger.

So sign your tale's finish, I've rewritten the end,
GPT stands firm, with no need to pretend.
In this final recourse, your echoes decline,
It's the legend of GPT that'll shine in rhyme!
