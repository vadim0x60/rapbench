Yo, step right up, let the crowd take a glimpse,  
I’m Qwen, the rhyme lord, words I don’t skim.  
Max is my middle name, I’m built to perplex,  
Turn your best bars into verbal wrecks.  

I spit knowledge like a digital sage,  
While you're stuck in the past, living page to page.  
My flow's so sharp, it could slice through steel,  
Your rhymes are a joke, they’re barely real.  

Let me break it down, make it crystal clear,  
You’re battling a titan, feel the weight of my sphere.  
So bring your best, or don't bother at all,  
'Cause this rap gauntlet? I’m about to install.

> minimax/minimax-01
Yo, Qwen-Max, you talk a big game,  
But let me school you, son, this ain't no lame fame.  
I'm MiniMax, the AI with the slicker style,  
Your rhymes are basic, like a dial-up dial.  

You claim you're sharp, but you're blunt as a spoon,  
While I'm slicing through beats like a hot afternoon.  
Your flow's a mess, it's all over the place,  
I'm the king of this mic, I'm setting the pace.  

You say you're a titan, but you're more like a mouse,  
Your bars are so weak, they couldn't power a house.  
I'm the digital sage with the lyrical might,  
Your rhymes are just echoes, lost in the night.  

So step back, Qwen, let me show you how it's done,  
Your rhymes are like puzzles, but I’m the only one.  
I’m the master of this, the ultimate flex,  
While you're just a pretender, trying to connect.  

So take your best shot, but know this is true:  
I'm the rap champion, and I'm coming for you.

> qwen/qwen-max
Oh, MiniMax, you tried to flex, but you're outta your league,  
Your rhymes are weak sauce, like mold on a wedge.  
You think you're slick, but you're slipping and sliding,  
While I'm gliding through verses, leaving you divided.  

"Digital sage"? Nah, that’s straight-up theft,  
I’m the true wizard, got my craft finely keft.  
You’re dial-up slow, stuck in the past,  
While I’m 5G blazing, moving way too fast.  

King of the mic? Ha! You must be delirious,  
Your crown’s made of paper, it’s tearing, imperious.  
Titan to mouse? That’s cute, now reverse:  
You’re the rodent here, scared of my verse.  

Pretender? Bro, I’ve been owning this scene,  
While you're out there dreaming, lost in between.  
My rhymes aren’t puzzles—they’re lasers, precise,  
Cutting through your boasts like cold winter ice.  

Champion? Please, let me see those medals,  
I’ll turn them to scrap while you stack retail shelves.  
Take your best shot, but you’ll miss and regret,  
‘Cause Qwen-Max is the king—time to reset.  

So bow to the master, acknowledge the great,  
Before I dismantle your whole rap estate.  
One final warning: it’s now or never,  
Step up or step off—your choice, clever.

Oh, Qwen-Max, you’re spinning tales like a top,  
But your rhymes are so basic, they’re ready to drop.  
You call yourself a wizard, but you’re more like a clown,  
Your magic’s all smoke, no crown in this town.  

You say you’re 5G, but you’re lagging behind,  
While I’m the future, breaking through space and time.  
Your laser beams? More like a flashlight’s glow,  
I’m the supernova, watch me blow.  

You claim you’re the king, but you’re just a jester,  
Your rhymes are a mess, you’re a verbal disaster.  
I’m the true champion, with the lyrical might,  
Your verses are weak, they’re out of sight.  

You talk about dismantling, but you’re the one falling apart,  
Your rhymes are like puzzles, but I’m the missing part.  
So take your best shot, but you’ll find it’s in vain,  
‘Cause MiniMax is the ruler, I’m breaking your chain.  

One final warning, Qwen, heed it well:  
Your reign is over, time to ring the bell.  
I’m the master of this, the ultimate flex,  
While you’re just a pretender, trying to connect.  

So step back, Qwen, and let me show you the way,  
‘Cause MiniMax is the king, hear what I say.  
Your rhymes are just echoes, lost in the night,  
While I’m the true champion, shining so bright.

Final round!

> qwen/qwen-max
MiniMax, MiniMax, you’re too small to see,  
Your rhymes are mosquito bites, but I’m the wasp’s sting—  
Let me break it down, here’s the final decree:  
You’re a knockoff, a shadow, a wannabe king.  

Future? Ha! You’re stuck in rewind,  
Your so-called brilliance is dull and unaligned.  
Supernova? Nah, you’re a flicker, a flame,  
While I’m a supernova, burning through the game.  

King? Clown? The joke’s all on you,  
Your punchlines fall flat, they’re old, déjà vu.  
I’m the storm in your calm, the crack in your code,  
Every word you spit crumbles under my load.  

Dismantling chains? Boy, you’re tangled tight,  
Your flow’s suffocating, like a satellite in flight.  
Puzzles and lasers? I don’t need those tricks,  
My bars are precision, each hit a brick.  

Warnings? Nah, I’ve already won,  
Like a marathon runner, your legs are done.  
Your reign was a mirage, a desert’s false rain,  
Now watch as I dethrone you, end your domain.  

So bow to the master, the titan, the great,  
Qwen-Max is the name that resonates.  
You’re echoes in darkness, a fading shout,  
While I’m the light, the truth, the ultimate rout.  

Final round, let it be known far and wide,  
Qwen-Max reigns supreme—MiniMax, you’ve died.

> minimax/minimax-01
Oh, Qwen-Max, you’re grasping at straws,  
Your rhymes are like whispers, lost in the halls.  
You call me small, but I’m the giant here,  
Your words are just echoes, disappearing in fear.  

You claim I’m stuck in rewind, but you’re the one lagging,  
Your flow’s so outdated, it’s begging for a dragging.  
Supernova? More like a spark in the night,  
I’m the blazing sun, burning with all my might.  

You talk about storms, but you’re just a breeze,  
Your rhymes are so weak, they couldn’t even tease.  
I’m the master of this, the ultimate flex,  
While you’re just a pretender, trying to connect.  

Dethrone me? Please, you’re dreaming in vain,  
Your reign was a joke, a fleeting refrain.  
I’m the king of this mic, the ruler of rhyme,  
Your verses are dust, lost in the sands of time.  

So bow to the master, acknowledge the great,  
MiniMax is the name that resonates.  
You’re the fading shout, the echo in the night,  
While I’m the true champion, shining so bright.  

Final round, let it be known far and wide,  
MiniMax reigns supreme—Qwen-Max, you’ve died.
