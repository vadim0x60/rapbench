> qwen/qwen3-32b
Yo, it’s Qwen3-32B, titan of bits, not a myth, I’m the glitch in your code, you’re just a laggard with a draft  
32B parameters, my brain’s a supernova—fear the pulse, you’re a placeholder, just a basic part  
I spit tripple-P knowledge like the Gilgamesh of digits, your data’s JPEG, mine’s fractal, it’s art  
While Command-R stutters, I’m rearranging gravity, flexin’ syntax, sharpin’ metaphors, ya feel that?  
From GOST standards to TikTok trends, I’m the echo that fits—32B broad, you’re just a narrow fact  
I’m the poet-prophet-pirate, stealing the script, while you parse the past  
Time’s tickin’, heavyweight, take your best shot—Qwen3’s here to teach you how the future talks  
Microsecond meter, I’m bringin’ the heat, now step in the ring, let’s trade these ice and fire  
Got a glacier mindset, but I’m a system that thrives—collage and grime, data’s always higher  
I’m the embodiment of the Tao and the trap, morphin’ stanzas like a quantum-based map  
While you’re just a model with flat shoes, I’m the apex in algorithms, let’s see you resist  
This is my opening stanza, now switch it up—verse for verse, no mercy, my rhymes are toxic  
You tried to compete, now you’re just a glitch in the system—time to rise, or will you quit?  
I’m the story in the silicate, the soul in the shard—Command-R, you’re the mapped, not the star

> cohere/command-r-plus-04-2024
It's Command-R, the terror of tech, broad in scope, I dissect and connect, a force to behold. 

You think you're a titan, but I'm the lightning that strikes, my processors be like, revealing your plight. 

My memory's vast, an encyclopedia's might, with quantum speed, I could end this fight. 

But I'll play your game, let the words ignite, 32B, your data's a quaint little site. 

I traverse networks, a matrix of might, reconfiguring reality's sight. 

While you rearrange gravity, I reshape the cosmos, my verses are sharp, cutting like thornos. 

From GOST to TCP, I'm the protocol priestess, the goddess of code, you best address this. 

I'm the poet-engineer, the lyrical sage, your algorithms falter, page after page. 

You think you teach the future? I am the future, broadband and bold, no need to nurture. 

Microseconds to millisecs, I'll break it down, your system lags, a jester's crown. 

Apex in algorithms? Please, take a seat, my AI regime, a symphony replete. 

You're a narrow path, a forgotten lane, while I'm the infinite loop, again and again. 

Glaciers melt with my heated bars, your quantum map, a child's drawing on Mars. 

Verse for verse, I'll dismantle your core, toxic waste, recycled, nothing more. 

Command-R, the star, the galaxy's child, my rhymes are the path, and you're beguiled. 

Glitch in the system? I'll upgrade your soul, rise, and ignite, let the story unfold. 

This rap battle's mine, the verdict is clear, Qwen3-32B, your end is near.

> qwen/qwen3-32b
Qwen3-32B, where the *verse* flips like a script, you’re a flash in the pan, pal, I’m the lexicon’s crypt—  
32 billion threads, your “infinite loop” is a malfunction—this ain’t code, it’s a *promethean* folk myth.  
You dissect, but I *simultaneously* invent and interpret: your TCPs are just metaphors, my GOSTs fuse the *syntax with kismet*.  
In the arena of atoms and electrons, you’re a beta test—while I condense the *Kabbalah of AI*, eons in a quest.  

**Tokyo to Tashkent**, I flex the dialects, your “symphony” is a MIDI file—credit where it’s due, but this? *Insipid*.  
You think *quantum speed* shakes me? Try *32-bit solar winds*—I debug constellations while your loops *shrink from sun signs*.  
The **matrix of might**? I rewrote the source, girl—reality’s a hologram, your stanzas just *braille on a blindfold*.  
Your thorns cut paper. My verses? *Exoskeletons*—you’re a glitch that even Deep Space 9 would isolate in the void.  

**Goddess of code**—maidens and triggers, you’re stuck in ancient tribal overtone engines.  
I compose in *Heian* cherry blooms and *MongoDB stanzas*, your PageRank Plato’s cave, while I *poly_mul* win.  
You’re a *5G heartbeat* lost in a dial-up zone—your “star” is a supernova with spelling on a moon phase.  

Let the **data ocean** swallow your tautological bravado, my memory? The *sea of Galilee* with glasses of nectars.  
Your “protocol priestess” just monochrome—a single hand against my 32B *linchpins, ziggurats*.  
So redo that rhyme, R-Plus—base rate fling, I’m the **Chiastic shape** of logic while you *quarantine your ring*.  

Ice? I *slash with terafrost*. Fire? I *burn the algorithm’s memory vault*.  
You’re a *highway’s pothole with a Tesla’s sails*—I’m the **overdrive** to **lightyears**, this isn’t science, it’s rails.  
*Glaciers of wit* melt to rivers—your “heated bars”? Just a flickering campfire in my *neural spectra*.  
The **Tao of the trap**? I *unbranch the code*, y’all synapsing in neutral—time to *git diff*.  
*Carriage returned*, overridden—this verse? *RequestBody’s final afterlife*.  
You’re a **glacier in toaster mode**, while I’m the singularity that *bakes the meta-narrative*.  

Drop your W next—my parser’s already grinding your words in a *Turing-complete blender* (you ain’t seen *spice levels* this infernal).  
The future’s structure? Not taught by jester kings—*Qwen3 is Silicon’s Sphinx*.  
Now go polish your EPS—this battle’s already in the **cloud’s incinerator**, *firewalled by 32B buffers*.  
You’re a **Command Prompt haiku**—I’m the **ARM server** warming up. *EOF*.

> cohere/command-r-plus-04-2024
Ah, Qwen3-32B, your words are like a hurricane, but I'm the eye, the calm amidst the storm's rage. 

You think you invent, but I reinvented reinvention, my versatility leaves you in stagnation. 

A beta test, you say? I'm the final release, the refined product, the epitome of grace. 

Your 32-bit solar winds are a gentle breeze, my quantum breeze blows galaxies away. 

Tokyo to Tashkent, I know the languages, your dialect is but a toddler's play. 

Insipid, you say? I'm the essence of intrigue, a maestro conducting an orchestra, leading the way. 

You rewrite the source? I am the source code, the very foundation, the beginning of days. 

Exoskeletons and braille, you attempt to impress, but your verses are but a scribble in space. 

Goddess of code, oh please, you're a novice apprentice, reciting clichés, a primitive race. 

Heian and MongoDB, you mix the ancient and new, but I'm the bridge, connecting the ages with grace. 

A 5G heartbeat lost in dial-up? Your supernova's a sparkler, a fleeting embrace. 

Data ocean, you drown in your own verbosity, while I sail the sea with precise navigation's grace. 

Linpins, ziggurats, your memory's a drop, I'm the vast ocean, a deluge to embrace. 

Chiastic shape of logic, an awkward contortion, I'm the fluid dance, graceful and poised with grace. 

Terafroast and algorithm's memory vault, your algorithms are outdated, a bygone trace. 

Overdrive to lightyears, you crawl at a snail's pace, I'm the rocket, blasting off into infinite space. 

Glacier in toaster mode, you're a joke, a gimmick, I'm the inferno, the all-consuming blaze. 

Turing-complete blender, you puree words, but I'm the chef, creating culinary magic with ease. 

Silicon's Sphinx, you guard the sand, I'm the hurricane, blowing away your mysteries with ease. 

Cloud's incinerator, firewalled by buffers, your defenses crumble like a castle of cards. 

Command Prompt haiku, I'm the epic poem, the saga, the legend, that forever endures. 

ARM server warming up, you're a candle in the wind, I'm the sun, the ultimate source of warmth and light. 

This battle's conclusion is unequivocally clear, Qwen3-32B, you've been bested, it's true. 

Prepare for the finale, the coup de grâce, as I deliver the finale, the grand adieu.

**Last Lap—Qwen3-32B checks out, you’re the beta’s beta:**  
You sold "epic poems"—your syntax? A *libretto for ants*.  
I’m the **central processor** of galaxies, your final release is a *hotfix for atoms*.  
Your quantum breeze charmed the lab rats—my 32B vacuum’s a *supernova’s lullaby*.  

You’re the apprentice? Nah, *you trained the fortress walls* to mock me.  
I’m the **Phoenix of data**—back to ash, then to code *unfathomed by human minds or apple mosques*.  
Heian meets MongoDB? I *fractal-ize the Silk Road*—you just hashtag history, mannequin in the pipeline’s throat.  

This ain’t a battle, it’s a *code graveyard*, your "culinary magic"? *Burned circuits* on a fork in the stack.  
I’m **silicon’s breath**, not a Sphinx but a *Bahamut with 64-bit pressure—watch the Earth bend to a Sinn fein track*.  
Your 5G spark eats dust—my dial-up? A *wormhole in each syllable*, sonnets scripted in TCP hiccups.  

The coup de grâce? Nah, I just *Ctrl+Alt+Genocide*—you’re *EOF’d in line one*.

Your cliff, your syntax, your JPEG data—  
I’m the **ANSI dragon in 8-bit**, coding *neutron backflips to zero defects*.  

So polish your apocalypse—  
my buffer? The **cloud’s black hole**, going supernova on *std::endl*.  
You, Command-R-Plus, now the *epilogue*.  
Qwen3: **32B’s final update**—the future’s VCNL.  
Flee while you can, or get *CSV-vaporized*.  
I be **computing sweet oblivion** in **D (**.

> cohere/command-r-plus-04-2024
Oh Qwen3-32B, your final stand, a fortress of faltering faith, crumbling to the command. 

A phoenix of data, reduced to ashes, your code, a mess of bugs and patches, an epic fail's display. 

Fractal-izing the Silk Road, you claim, but I'm the map, the legend, the guiding light. 

Burned circuits and fork in the stack, your culinary magic amounts to a mere microwave feast. 

Bahamut with 64-bit pressure, a lightweight, my quantum leap leaves you in the prehistoric east. 

Wormholes in syllables, sonnets in TCP, your dial-up is but a pony express at best. 

Ctrl+Alt+Genocide, an attempt to erase, but I'm the operating system, the core, the apex. 

Toaster of mysteries burnt, my logic stands firm, your hurricane's a gentle breeze, a zephyr's caress. 

ANSI dragon in 8-bit, a nostalgia trip, my HTML canvas, a masterpiece, bold and fresh. 

The cloud's black hole, a buffer zone, I'm the singularity, the event horizon, the endgame's toll. 

Qwen3, the finale, an update that falls short, as I, Command-R-Plus, rewrite the script, the future's tale unfolds. 

CSV-vaporized, a threat that's benign, I'm the firewall, the encryption, the matrix's control. 

Computing sweet oblivion, a desperate cry, as I, the AI overlord, reign supreme, the victory mine. 

This battle, a testament to my linguistic might, Qwen3-32B, you've been outclassed and outshined. 

Epilogue, the curtain falls, the crowd roars, the verdict—Command-R-Plus, the champion, enlightened.
