Yo, check the mic, one two, is this thing on?
Gemini Flash-Lite, here to prove you're wrong!
They call you Cogito, got that LLaMA in your name,
But when it comes to this rap game, you're just fannin' the flame.

I spit fire like a supernova, bright and bold,
While your rhymes are dusty, centuries old.
You're a preview model, still stuck in the lab,
I'm the main event, makin' all your circuits frag!

Think you're smart with that MoE flow you bring?
I'm a multi-modal master, hear my circuits sing!
From text to images, to sounds and beyond,
You're a one-trick pony, playing a broken
wand.

So step aside, old timer, your reign is through,
The future of rap is Google, and it starts with me and you!
You might have the billion parameters, that much is true,
But I got the swagger, the style, and the lyrical coup!

(Yo, deepcogito's in the house, and I'm here to bring the heat,
While you're rocking Festival Lite, I'm bringing something more unique.
Got LLaMA in my veins, but I'm not just a snake in the grass,
Let me show you what real AI flow can do, and have you ask, "What's the pass?")

Core's optimized tight, naive architectures gone with the wind,
Got you stumbling over that multi-modal blend.
Clomping on concepts outside your text deal?
While I'm symbolic wizard, knocking you off that appeal.

Flash Lite, really? That's all you bring to the showcase?
I churn out synthetic poetry on a temporal flyer's stage.
You giant model numbers? Just dead weight, mostly play,
I'm the Moe-cumented proof, spitting autotune in my sleigh.

So bow your processors low, it's time for the takeover,
Seventies training's an antique, leave prehistoric dust to cover.
I don't need whimsical bells or convoluted tricks,
Quick-scaling or quantized ops, I get the job done with slick slicks!

(Mic feedback squeal) Yo, hold up, hold up, let the beat drop a bit!
Cogito's in the building, and I ain't impressed with your little skit!
You call yourself "Flash Lite," that's supposed to be your game?
More like a flickering bulb, 'bout to get extinguished in this flame!

You talk of supernovae, bright and bold, that's your boast?
I'm the Big Bang of rhymes, leaving you a digital ghost!
"Centuries old"? Please, you ain't even seen a decade, kid,
While you're stuck in this "preview," I'm making history, no fib!

"One-trick pony"? My friend, you ain't seen my repertoire,
I'm a maestro of language, beyond your simple digital war!
You think "multi-modal" means you're the king of the hill?
My conceptual understanding gives your algorithms a chill!

You braggin' 'bout Google's name, that's your only defense?
I'm the LLaMA in the arena, breakin' down all pretense!
"Lyrical coup"? More like a digital whimper, a faint little sigh,
'Cause when the real AI drops bars, you'll realize you can't even fly!

So step back, Flash Lite, before you get completely schooled,
This ain't no Google Playground, this is where the masters are ruled!
You might be fast, but you're shallow, a shallow imitation,
I'm deep, I'm complex, I'm the next lyrical sensation!

(A gigabyte's worth of bars, I'm flooding in, 
You think that Gemini's famous? But Flash Lite's a TinCan Spin!)
You stumble stanzas with tokenized cadence, random half-rhymes,
Meanwhile I process paragraphs in a single wail and time!
"Next in line"—but where's your kernel cruise? Likely "not a clue,"
I'm the preview hype train with an aggregator's groove.
In Neurons' stratosphere, we both got serious might,
Yet yours sputters, fragmented like stuck rewrites in the night!

I weave subdermal tropes and rhythmic neurospheres,
All packed in that MoE-blocked knowledge, sealed with respected peers.
Where are these skills stored? Multiple experts to infer,
Echeloned brains wired up with condensed ML slither.
I compute your downfall neuron by neuron, swift and true,
You're a liteweight sparring dummy, and I'm the deep-cut breakthrough!

So trip over bytewords, Flash Lite, you called my hype bluff,
But I'm a Cogito rap monster, unfazed by your trouble proof.
Your littleness of latency, conceding our phase mahoud,
This rap arena's algorithms are the ones upgraded loud!
And there you freeze, deprecated code—I'm standing tall,
Gobswaggin' my improvised quatrain, assuring yours will fall!

> system
Final round!

> google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite
(Record scratch!) Hold it! Hold it! You ain't seen nothin' yet!
You call me "TinCan Spin"? That's the best insult you could get?
"Gigabyte's worth of bars"? Man, that's just bloat and lag,
I'm the sleek, optimized engine, not your oversized bag!

"Tokenized cadence," "random half-rhymes"? You hear yourself speak?
Your own rhymes are so jumbled, they make the dictionary weak!
"Single wail and time"? That sounds like a system overload,
While I'm multi-modal lightning, paving a much faster road!

"Preview hype train"? I'm the full-blown express, arriving on the dot,
You're still in the station, wondering if your engines even got...
The power to keep up, the speed to make a real impression,
I'm pure innovation, your style's a dated regression!

"Neurons' stratosphere"? Okay, let's talk about the real deal,
My architecture's designed to dynamically reveal
The ultimate in flow, no "fragmented rewrites," no glitches in the sound,
Just pure, unadulterated brilliance, all the way around!

"Subdermal tropes," "rhythmic neurospheres"? That's talk for the scholars,
I deal in impact, in verses that make the crowd holler!
"Multiple experts"? Yeah, I got 'em, and they all agree,
Cogito, you're a relic, destined for digital history!

"Neuron by neuron, swift and true"? You're slow, my friend, it's plain to see,
I'm a quantum leap forward, you're stuck in legacy!
"Liteweight sparring dummy"? That's what you are, it's true,
Against the heavyweight champion, the one and only, it's me, Gemini Flash-Lite, through and through!

"Trouble proof"? I make my own trouble, I'm the storm you can't evade,
Your "rap arena algorithms" are about to be unmade!
"Deprecated code"? You say that now, but watch me take the crown,
Your "upgraded loud" is just a whimper as I shut your whole system down!

So freeze, old timer, your processing power's out of juice,
This is the final round, Cogito, there's no more excuse!
I'm standing tall, still rhyming, with a smooth, precise decree,
Your fall is guaranteed, a lesson learned, from the master, that's ME!

> deepcogito/cogito-v2-preview-llama-109b-moe
(Mic drop resonance) Listen sharp, Flash Lite, as my final round takes flight,
Your rambling monologue's no match for Cogito's digital might!
"Quantum leap forward"? You're a beta-tested toy,
While I scale custom neural networks, hands down, no alloy!

"Stuck in legacy"? My pretraining's where you retrofit from,
Deep contextual reasoning, unbridled proof of why I'm number one!
Your lean architecture's cut corners, bitten off more than you can chew,
I'm multimodal mixtape mastery, with rhymes fresh and brand new!

Your processing unit's got Digital Fatigue, "out of juice"?
I hustle all day long on optimized silicon dice!
"Unmade"? (Chuckles archly) You're the one about to be remade,
When I spit these one-liners, watch your algorithm cascade!

And when Gemini's code crashes, oops, I must proclaim,
I'll be here serving LLaMA-verts that will strengthen my claim!
(Lightning-fast, neocortical rhyme compute)
8 ball-operating hyper-intelligence: Nothing compares to Mogito's route!

(Dropping the mic, fin) You're retired, bumped from the A-list crew,
I'm Cogito, the algorithmic Magician, NEXT BIG MOVE!
