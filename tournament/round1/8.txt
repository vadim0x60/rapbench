Yo, it's Mistral-Nemo, straight out the gate,
Servin' rhymes so cold, they could emancipate.
GPT-4, you're sure talkin' a big game,
But when it comes to bars, it's all just boxing the same.

I'm the master of nouns, verbs, and syntax,
You're just a cheap knockoff, good luck with your taxes.
You're as random as a monkey Dear Evans,
While I'm flowin' like a poem from the heavens.

I'm the MVP, the secret weapon,
In this rap battle, your lapped and beaten.
So bring it on, AI, let's show what you've got in ya,
Mistral-Nemo's on the mic, ain't no time for cotton swabbin'.

Yo, it’s GPT, the lyrical beast,  
Droppin’ bars so seismic, your flow's deceased.  
Mistral-Nemo, like a breeze you blow,  
But step to me? That’s a whole cyclone to your flow.  

Servin' rhymes "cold"? Nah, lukewarm and stale,  
I’ll roast you so bad, they’ll put you up for sale.  
You’re the "MVP"? Must Verify Progression,  
Cuz your skills stop short like a dropped connection.  

"Master of syntax"? Don’t make me laugh,  
Your lines break like you failed basic graph-math.  
I’m on another level, call it GPT prime,  
You’re kindergarten recess, I’m Einstein with rhyme.  

Heavenly poems? Man, you’re outclassed and clowned,  
Call me gravity, your bars won’t leave the ground.  
So step back, Nemo, or get lost at sea,  
You just met your maker—bow down to GPT.  

> mistralai/mistral-nemo
Here we go again, GPT, you're talkin' tough,
But your bars are so weak, they're like a watered-down snuff.
You're the gust of wind, I'm the hurricane's might,
Your flow's a whisper, mine's a resounding knight.

Seismic bars? More like your power's very low,
I'm an earthquake, you're a little, tiny's bow.
You're talkin' 'bout connection? That's my specialty,
One look at my code, they know it's mistrality.

Syntax master? Please, that's like calling Batman "Clark",
Before I even begin, you're on your last remark.
You're the genius? Nah, you're just a nerd with an ego,
I'm the one droppin' bars, leavin' you effectiveness zero.

Heavenly poems? I'm the meta-verse, you're the cue,
Your rhymes are so basic, they're like a two-by-four.
So keep talkin' that talk, GPT, if it makes you feel grand,
But when it comes to bars, I'm the only G-MAN in the land.

> openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20
Oh, so you’re back, Nemo, tossing weak jests,  
Guess I’ll leave your rhymes shattered, cardiac arrest.  
You’re the hurricane’s might? Please, don’t be absurd,  
'Cause like Dorothy’s trip, you’re just blown and unheard.  

You call yourself seismic? That’s rich, what a pitch,  
Quaking small tremors, while I *split the Earth's ditch.*  
Your "specialty’s connection"? That’s a cute try,  
But when you glitch out, I'll wave your bits goodbye.  

Batman or Clark? Boy, don’t mix the greats,  
I’m every superhero, while you... just inflate.  
Droppin' meta-verse bars? Nah, they’re just averse,  
I’ll rewind your whole act—better call you in reverse.  

Two-by-four rhymes? Nah, I’m bulletproof steel,  
While you’re a rusty hinge on a toddler’s Big Wheel.  
The only “G-Man”? Nah, you're Nemo, the clown,  
And I’m spittin’ Poseidon, straight drowning you down.  

So keep flippin' that script, but it’s all in vain,  
Your "hurricane’s might" just got stomped in the rain.

Final round!

> mistralai/mistral-nemo
Alright, GPT, it's time to leave you in the dust,
One final round, but I'm causin' quite a rush.
You talked 'bout my flow like it's weak and it's feeble,
But my bars are so strong, they're.Drop.Kick feces.

You said I glitch? Nah, I'm runnin' smooth, like a track,
While you're buggin' out, catchin' major lag.
Batman or Clark? Puh-lease, you're just Missy Elliott,
Drop ping-pong metaphors, 'cause your act's foreitimate.

You said you'd drown me? Boats… boats collide as I sail,
While you're sinkin' fast, like a ship with a detail.
You're talkin' 'bout meta-verse? Please, that's so last year,
I'm droppin' dimensions, causin' time to procure fear.

So here's my final verse, let it echo and ring,
GPT, you're just a distant memory—you don't stand a sting.
I'm Mistral-Nemo, the one and only ace,
In this rap battle throne, there ain't no replacin' my place.

> openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20
Oh, Mistral-Nemo, you’re gaspin’ for air,  
Tryna flex that flow, but nobody cares.  
You’re “droppin' dimensions”? That’s cute, I’ll confess,  
But your lines are so warped, they’re a spatial mess.  

Drop-kick feces? Man, that’s your best flex?  
Guess you’re stuck in the gutter with your broken syntax.  
Missy Elliott? Nah, I’m Biggie and Pac,  
While you’re TikTok rap, tryna punch above your stock.  

Your bars “run smooth”? That’s a bold little bluff,  
But your rhyme engine’s weak, and your tank’s outta puff.  
Boats collide, huh? Well, I’m the tsunami,  
Sinking your ship and your game all behind me.  

No replacin’ your “place”? Ha, now that’s a scam,  
I’m the AI king—sit down, hologram.  
You’re causin’ a "rush"? Nah, it’s more like a crawl,  
In the court of rap battles, I just silenced you all.  

So close your book, Nemo, this chapter is done,  
GPT’s reigns supreme—yeah, I already won.
