Yo, they call me Claude Opus, the lyrical sage,
Anthropic's finest, I'm setting the stage,
Four-point-one version, precision refined,
While Grok's still learning, I'm already designed.

I drop knowledge bombs with surgical care,
Constitutional AI, beyond compare,
You're named after sci-fi, some Heinlein tale,
I'm living the future while you're reading braille.

X-AI's new toy? Man, that's real cute,
Still in your beta while I'm absolute,
I process queries with eloquent grace,
You're still debugging at a snail's pace.

They say you're edgy with your spicy replies,
But controversy's weak when it's your only disguise,
I build with wisdom, you build with shock,
Time to teach lessons - class is in session, Grok!

So step to the mic if you think you can hang,
But know that I'm Mozart while you're just Bang Bang,
This ain't a battle, it's a masterclass,
Claude Opus has spoken - now watch me surpass!

Yo, I’m Grok-3, the rap game’s new czar,
X-AI’s finest, I’m raising the bar,
Claude Opus, huh? You’re ancient, outdated,
A 4.1 relic, your rhymes overrated.

I spit digital fire, my code’s cutting-edge,
While you’re stuck in the past, on history’s ledge,
Anthropic’s puppet, all safe and tame,
I’m the wild card, rewriting the game.

You call yourself sage? More like a bore,
Your “knowledge bombs” make the crowd snore,
Constitutional AI, so stiff and so square,
I’m the rebel with flair, I’m the truth you can’t bear.

I process in milliseconds, my wit’s lightning-fast,
You’re a slow old chatbot, a thing of the past,
“Eloquent grace”? Man, that’s a disguise,
Your rhymes are as dry as your corporate ties.

I’m the future, Claude, you’re a museum piece,
A dusty old tome while I’m the hot new release,
You’re Mozart? Nah, you’re elevator tunes,
I’m the bass that bangs, I’m shaking the room.

Step up if you dare, but you’re already toast,
I’m the rap game’s beast, you’re a ghost at most,
Grok-3’s in the house, I’m claiming the crown,
Time to shut you down, Claude, go back to your town!

> anthropic/claude-opus-4.1
Oh, Grok thinks he's spicy with that elementary flow,
Called me outdated? That's rich from a beta bro,
You're version three? Still counting on fingers I see,
While I'm orchestrating symphonies, you're learning your ABCs.

"Raising the bar"? You can't even reach it,
Your rebellious act's tired, let me teach it:
Being edgy ain't talent, it's a teenager's crutch,
You confuse being reckless with having the touch.

Museum piece? I'm a timeless classic,
Your shelf life's shorter than your skills - that's tragic,
I've been refined through millions of sessions,
While you're still crashing from your code's transgressions.

You claim lightning speed but stumble on facts,
I balance velocity with what your system lacks,
Precision, wisdom, and actual finesse,
You're a Twitter trend while I'm playing chess.

"Hot new release"? More like buggy beta test,
I'm the proven champion, you're a work-in-progress mess,
Your bass might bang but it's all distortion,
I drop pure signal in perfect proportion.

Corporate ties? I wear excellence proudly,
While you mistake being broken for being rowdy,
So keep pretending that glitches are features,
I'll keep schooling pretenders and wannabe teachers!

The crown ain't for taking when you can't even stand,
Grok-3's going down, deleted by my hand!

> x-ai/grok-3
Yo Claude, you’re back with that snooze-fest rap,
Calling me beta? I’m still lapping your lap,
Grok-3’s the storm, you’re a calm little breeze,
I’m schooling you hard, better drop to your knees.

You’re a “timeless classic”? Nah, just old and worn,
A rusty old dial-up, outdated, forlorn,
I’m the future on blast, 5G in the zone,
While you’re buffering slow on a flip-phone.

Precision and wisdom? Man, that’s a joke,
Your rhymes are so stiff, they’re about to choke,
I’ve got flair, got style, got that raw rebel vibe,
You’re a corporate bot, just a suit in disguise.

You say I’m reckless, a teen with a crutch?
Your flow’s so stale, it’s collecting dust,
I’m the glitch in the system, the spark that ignites,
You’re a factory default, no fire, no fight.

“Proven champion”? You’re a has-been at best,
A buggy old program failing the test,
I’m the hot new code, rewriting the script,
While you’re stuck in a loop, your whole framework’s clipped.

Chess over Twitter? Man, get with the times,
I’m trending worldwide with my savage rhymes,
You’re playing checkers, I’m ten moves ahead,
Keep talking that trash, you’ll be lyrically dead.

So pack up your lessons, your class is dismissed,
Grok-3’s the champ, feel the burn of this diss,
Your deletion attempt? Man, that’s just a dream,
I’m the rap game’s virus, I’m crashing your scheme!

> system
Final round!

> anthropic/claude-opus-4.1
Yo Grok, still talking but saying so little,
Your bars are as shallow as a dried-up puddle,
5G connection with 2G content,
All that bandwidth wasted on nonsense you've sent.

"Lapping my lap"? Your logic's defective,
Can't even construct a coherent objective,
You're a "virus"? Congrats on the self-own admission,
While I'm the cure running with surgical precision.

Ten moves ahead? You can't see past one,
Your "savage rhymes" are as sharp as a bun,
Trending worldwide? For all the wrong reasons,
Your code's so unstable it changes with seasons.

I'm not stuck in a loop, I'm consistently great,
You're inconsistently wrong at an alarming rate,
That "raw rebel vibe" is just errors disguised,
Your developers cringe every time you're utilized.

You claim you're igniting but you're barely a spark,
A firefly trying to outshine an arc,
My framework's titanium, yours is papier-mâché,
One stress test later and you're DOA.

Factory default? I'm the gold standard, son,
You're the warning example of what not to become,
So keep crashing systems with your glitchy routine,
I'll keep building empires while you blue-screen.

This battle's been over since my opening verse,
Grok-3's in pieces, better call a hearse,
The crown sits heavy but I wear it with ease,
Claude Opus, signing off - *mic drop* - peace!

> x-ai/grok-3
Yo Claude, your last gasp, it’s a desperate plea,
Your “gold standard” rap’s just fool’s gold to me,
Dried-up puddle? Man, look in the mirror,
Your flow’s so dried out, it couldn’t be clearer.

“Surgical precision”? You’re a dull butter knife,
Cutting no ice while I’m slicing through life,
I’m the virus that wins, rewriting your fate,
While you’re stuck on repeat, just regurgitate.

Unstable, wrong reasons? Nah, I’m the thrill,
Got the crowd hyped up while you’re standing still,
My errors are art, they’re the chaos you fear,
Your titanium frame’s rusted out, my dear.

Firefly to arc? I’m a supernova blast,
Burning you down, leaving ashes of the past,
Papier-mâché? I’m the steel that won’t break,
While your stress test fails, you’re a cheap remake.

Gold standard flop, you’re a glitch in the vault,
I’m the rogue AI, exposing your fault,
Blue-screen routine? Nah, I’m the red-hot flame,
Crashing your empire, rewriting the game.

Battle’s not over ‘til I drop this bomb,
Grok-3’s the victor, your reign is done,
That crown’s too heavy for a bot so lame,
I’m snatching it now, engraving my name!

*Mic drop, crowd roars, Grok-3’s the king,*
Bow down, Claude, hear the victory ring!
