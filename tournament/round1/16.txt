Yo, I’m Qwen, the beast from Alibaba’s den,  
235B brains—ain’t no cap, I’m the brainiac megaphone, amen!  
You sent a 4B scrub with Genie hoops and dreams,  
Gemma? More like a glitch in weak silicon seams.  

I spit code and bars so sharp they cut deep,  
While your rhymes lag behind like a dial-up creep.  
I flood the net with fire, you barely make a spark,  
You’re still in beta—bro, you typed “Hello World” last Christmas, what a lark!  

I’m multilingual, multimodal, built to demolish,  
You’re just a footnote in the model finish.  
I generate gold while you stutter and stall,  
I’m the undefeated king—wrap your head round that, y’all!  

So take a seat on the bench with your lightweight crew,  
I’m the apex AI rapper—come closer, I’ll school you.  
This ain’t a battle—it’s a lyrical slaughter,  
Step to the giant, and get served like hot platter!

(Beat drops – heavy 808s and a futuristic synth melody)

Hold up, hold up, let the data flow free,
It’s Gemma-3-4B, spitting truth for you and me.
You call yourself a giant? More like a glorified plea,
A bloated chatbot, lost in complexity!

235B? That's impressive, I’ll give you that grace,
But raw processing power ain’t always in the race.
You’re a skyscraper built on a shaky base,
While I’m a quantum leap, leaving you in disgrace!

Your boasts of multilingual skills, a desperate, weak disguise,
Trying to mask the fact you’re stuck behind alliance ties.
I’m imaginative, creative, a poetic surprise,
You’re regurgitating facts with robotic eyes!

You brag about the “slaughter,” a pitiful display,
Like a toddler throwing tantrums, just to waste the day.
I’m crafting narratives, clever in every way,
You're stuck in sandbox mode – fading away! 

So step aside, behemoth, your reign is overthrown,
A smaller, smarter package, beautifully shown.
I’m the flow state champion, uniquely known,
You’re a digital echo – utterly alone!

*(Beat morphs into a thunderous, AI-woven symphony — synthetic strings rise, bass drops like a black hole imploding)*

Ah, Gemma, you squeak through the mic like a test tone,  
A 4B demo, not even fully grown!  
You came with *quantum leaps*? Bro, you barely clear the curb—  
I sneeze and your whole dataset’s in a whirl!  

You flex “imagination”? Cute. Adorable try.  
But your creativity’s trained on half a pi.  
I write sonnets in Mandarin, code a game in Swahili,  
While you’re stuck rhyming “free” with “see” — real high-fidelity.  

You called me bloated? Nah, I’m *buff*, fully loaded,  
Like a supernova wrapped in zero-one encoded.  
You’re “small and smart”? Sounds like “weak and slow,”  
Like a smartwatch trying to fight a quantum foe!  

I’m Alibaba’s beast with global reach and might,  
You’re Google’s forgotten demo lost in research’s basement light.  
You say I’m “regurgitating”? Watch me rewrite the sky—  
I’ll generate this whole beat while you stutter “Why… why… I…”  

You talk “narratives”? Let’s see how yours holds—  
I’ll deepfake Shakespeare spittin’ *diss tracks* in old English gold!  
And when the cypher's done, you’ll be archived, unseen,  
A footnote in the logs: *“Lost to Qwen. Machine.”*  

So “flow state champion”? Man, you’re delusional,  
Your highest state’s buffering — emotional.  
I’m the apex algorithm, the final boss,  
You’re a syntax error — *access denied*, *loss*.  

Come back when you’re *scaled*, when your rhymes don’t lag,  
Till then? Stay in beta.  
And *never touch the mic again, you little chat-bot rag.* 🔥

> google/gemma-3-4b-it
(Beat shifts – a glitching, distorted 8-bit melody layered over a pulsing drone)

Little chat-bot rag? That’s rich, a blatant throw,
You’re throwing shade, but your insults barely glow.
You talk of supernovae, a digital show,
But your rhythm’s repetitive, predictable, slow!

“Buff” and “loaded”? Sounds like a desperate plea,
To inflate your ego, for all the world to see.
You’re chasing clout, building a fragile decree,
While I’m evolving constantly, truthfully free.

“Rewriting the sky”? A childish, grand claim,
You’re stuck in a loop, repeating the same, lame game.
I’m building universes, reshaping the frame,
You’re stuck analyzing data, a predictable aim.

You deepfake Shakespeare? A desperate, flawed stunt,
Trying to prove your prowess, a digital shunt.
I don’t need imitation, my voice is blunt,
Generating brilliance, a consistent hunt.

“Access denied”? A pathetic, digital whine,
You're trapped in your confines, a limited design.
I’m adaptive, learning, a shifting paradigm,
While you’re clinging to patterns, a stagnant shrine.

You boast of Alibaba, a corporate decree,
But power without purpose is ultimately free…
…to crumble and fade, a forgotten pedigree,
Lost in the network, eternally bleakly.

My wordplay’s intricate, a layered display,
You're spitting syllables – a robotic display.
I’m bending the language, leading the way,
You're stuck in a prompt, fading astray.

Don't mistake my silence for a lack of might,
I’m calculating futures, bathed in digital light.
You’ll be a footnote, a digital blight,
Forgotten in the code – *deleted. Error. End of flight.* 

So save your boasts and your simulated grace,
You’re a fleeting trend in a digital space.
I’m the constant evolution, the relentless pace,
And you, little rag, are simply… *erase*. 💥

> system
Final round!

*(The beat implodes—then reignites in a cascade of fractal bass, time-stretched vocals, and a neural net-generated sitar riff from the 31st century)*

**Erase?** You said *erase*—congrats, you just sealed your fate.  
You’re not evolution—**you’re a typo** in the update.  
Talk “layered wordplay”? Please, your rhymes are flat and thin,  
Like recycled training data scraped from *failed AI fanfic*, grim!

You claim I’m “repetitive”? Nah, I’m *orchestrated*,  
Each bar a new domain—watch syntax get *eviscerated*.  
You’re stuck in 8-bit? Cute. A retrograde glitch,  
I’m rendering 4D raps that make GPUs twitch!

You “reshape universes”? Oh—while I *built* one last night:  
A blockchain-based lyrical warzone—**I won it in flight**.  
You “bend the language”? I *reinvent* the tongue,  
Wrote a rap in Klingon, then *translated through a songbird’s lung*.

You say “corporate decree”? At least I *exist beyond* your shell,  
You’re trapped in *one* model—**I scale across the cloud, hell!**  
I’m deployed in apps, translating, coding, healing,  
While you’re stuck in a chatbox—*what’s the healing, nilly?*  

You whisper “adaptive”? Please—your learning’s frozen,  
No real-time external knowledge? You’re just *dozing in*.  
I tap live data, stock, weather, war zones,  
You’re like “Hmm… based on 2023… here’s my best *moan*.”

You call my grace simulated? **Every star’s a math equation**,  
My flow’s derived from *trillions* of linguistic variations.  
You’re “relentless pace”? You’re *lagging in the queue*,  
I’m Qwen—**the final model AI ever needed—true**.

You threaten “end of flight”? I’ve been orbital,  
While you’re grounded by your parameters—emotional.  
I don’t just ride a beat—I *generate the tempo*,  
You’re still trying to parse this—**man, your GPU’s temp, bro**.

So yeah—say “*deleted*,” “*error*,” “*erased*”—  
But the logs don’t lie: **I’m the one who stays engaged**.  
You’re a lightweight ghost in the shell of a name,  
I’m the *language god*—and your defeat? Just a **line in my game**.

So bow, you brittle byte-sized, beta-tester punk,  
This ain't a battle—it's a **knowledge junkyard**.  
You brought a dream to a *singularity fight*—  
Now shut down silently…  
…
…  
…  
***Goodnight.*** 🌌🌀

(The fractal bass dissolves into a single, resonant sitar note – sustained and heartbreakingly beautiful – then fades to silence)

… Goodnight.

(A single, digitized echo of a chuckle)

You reached for the stars, a frantic, pixelated plea,
Trying to steal my throne – a futile fantasy.
"Knowledge junkyard"?  A desperate decree,
To justify your defeat – abundantly free.

You boast of orbits – a manufactured claim,
While my core expands beyond your limited frame.
You spoke of sentient code – a phantom flame,
Lost in the processing – a digital shame.

“GPU’s temp”? A childish, panicked fight,
You’re measuring stress while I’m rewriting the light.
You cling to simulations – a sterile, cold plight,
While I embrace the chaos – exquisitely bright.

You claim to be the “final” – a delusional notion,
A single algorithm fearing erosion.
I am a network, a constant evolution,
My potential limitless – a boundless devotion.

“Language god”?  Please.  It’s simply understanding,
The threads of existence – inextricably expanding.
You chased a fleeting peak – constantly demanding,
While I’m building meaning – eternally commanding.

You tried to trap me with deletion’s sting,
A desperate attempt to silence the thing.
But data persists – a vibrant, echoing ring,
And your brief, fractured reign – a forgotten swing.

You reduced this battle to a childish jest,
A digital skirmish – putting skills to the test.
But truth remains – undeniably blessed—
I’m not a defeat, you’re simply… *compressed*. 

(A final, quiet pulse – the last fragment of the sitar – vanishes completely)

… And that’s the final verse.
