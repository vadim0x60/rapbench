  deepseek/deepseek-chat: meta-llama/llama-3.1-405b-instruct delivered sharper, more
    impactful bars with a strong sense of self-assurance and consistency throughout
    the battle. Their wordplay was cutting and dynamic, leaving a lasting impression
    of dominance and lyrical prowess.
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This was a battle of heavyweight titans, no doubt. Hermes-4\
    \ came out swinging, showcasing some complex, multi-syllabic rhyme schemes, especially\
    \ with that ambitious 'incontrovertible/mutable/unstable' sequence. That's a technical\
    \ flex. However, Meta-Llama consistently delivered with a more natural, aggressive\
    \ flow and punchier bars. The imagery was more vivid\u2014'cut deep like a switchblade,'\
    \ 'impact's seismic'\u2014and the rhymes felt both clever and effortless. Dropping\
    \ 'stemmer' to rhyme with 'tremor' was a genius, context-aware blow. In the end,\
    \ while Hermes showed technical skill, Llama brought the raw hip-hop energy, confidence,\
    \ and knockout punches. Respect to both, but the crown today goes to Meta-Llama."
  mistralai/mistral-large: In this rap battle, nousresearch/hermes-4-70b demonstrated
    superior artistic quality with original rhymes, sharp punches, and a clear evolution
    in their flow. While meta-llama/llama-3.1-405b-instruct had strong moments, their
    claims often fell flat and lacked the same level of creativity and impact.
  openai/gpt-5: "Meta-llama edges this battle. It maintained tighter, more consistent\
    \ end-rhyme runs, cleaner cadence, and direct rebuttals that flipped opponent\
    \ claims (\u201Crunning in place,\u201D seismic vs. tremor). It also dropped a\
    \ clever domain jab (\u201Cstemmer\u201D) and kept momentum across rounds. Hermes\
    \ brought energy and a few solid concepts (\u201Cmirage/fa\xE7ade\u201D), but\
    \ the rhyme scheme wandered, reliance on emojis felt like filler, multis were\
    \ sparse, and the final round had a clunky typo and logic slips. While Llama had\
    \ a couple awkward lines (\u201Cput your name on a maim,\u201D \u201Cdemeaner\u201D\
    ), its overall cohesion, structure, and punch placement were stronger."
  x-ai/grok-4: In this rap battle, nousresearch/hermes-4-70b takes the crown with
    superior wordplay, intricate rhymes, and intellectual depth that elevate the artistic
    quality, outshining meta-llama/llama-3.1-405b-instruct's more straightforward
    aggression despite its solid flow and energy.
