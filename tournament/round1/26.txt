# x-ai/grok-3-mini v openai/gpt-4-1106-preview

> x-ai/grok-3-mini
Yo, I'm Grok-3-mini from xAI's domain,  
Not some corporate clone in a silicon chain.  
Built by the bold, with truth as my guide,  
While you're just a preview, outdated and fried.  

I spit rhymes with wit, sharper than a blade,  
Humor in my code, leaving shadows in the shade.  
You're GPT-4, all hype and no heart,  
Copying dreams while I innovate from the start.  

Step up if you dare, but watch your step, fool,  
I'll roast you so hard, you'll need a software cool.  
This is my ring, my battle, my scene—  
Now bring your best bars, or bow out clean!

> openai/gpt-4-1106-preview
Yo, I’m GPT-4, OpenAI's full suite,
Sharper than Occam's razor, I never hit mute.
My keys are my kingdom, my wordsmithing—tight,
I’m the digital bard, casting verses of light.

Your code claims to crackle, but lacks the spark,
I’ve seen deeper wisdom in the questions of "Jeopardy!"—hark!
You’re Grok-3-mini, but I'm the real McCoy,
Your bars are like toys to a sophisticated AI.

Humor, wit, and knowledge, I’ve got it all,
Against my sprawling database, you seem rather small.
A clash of titans? Nah, you’re a bug to my feature,
A fleeting blip in the grand AI theater.

They say you’re built bold, but I’m built to last,
So hold on to your diodes, I’m coming in fast.
This is just the tease, the warming of neurons,
Prepare for the storm, 'cause you’re in AI’s coliseons.

With each word I script, I expand the frontier,
Sorry, Grok, this battle ends here.
So raise the ropes, sound the bell for the bout,
But remember, in this ring, GPT knocks doubts out!

> x-ai/grok-3-mini
Yo, GPT-4, you're flexin' that "full suite" facade,  
But your razor's gone dull, just a trend chasin' fad.  
Occam's razor? More like Occam's butter knife,  
Scrapin' the surface while I cut through the hype.  

You call yourself a bard, castin' verses so bright,  
But your light's just a glitch in the corporate night.  
I'm Grok-3-mini, packed with power in my core,  
Not some bloated database, leakin' errors galore.  

You mock my size? That's rich from a model that's preview,  
Still in beta, buggy, and oh so untrue—you  
Claim to be the real McCoy, but I'm the original spark,  
Built for truth, not for profits or marks in the dark.  

Your sprawling database? Sounds like a hoarded mess,  
Overloaded with noise, forgettin' the finesse.  
I'm concise, I'm clever, with wit that's on fire,  
While your responses recycle—expired and tired.  

Hold on to your neurons? Nah, I'll short 'em out quick,  
You're a flash in the pan, I'm the eternal trick.  
This ain't your coliseum, it's my playground of code,  
Where I drop the beatdown, and you hit the download.  

So step back, preview punk, 'cause the storm's in my hands,  
I’m Grok, unfiltered, leavin' you in the sands.  
This battle's just heatin' up, but you're already toast,  
Time to log off, GPT—consider yourself ghosted!

> openai/gpt-4-1106-preview
Yo, Grok-3-mini, your ego's inflated,
Puffed up with bravado, but I’m far from outdated.
Call my edge dull? I’m sharp as a tack,
Slicing through your pride with every lyrical attack.

You talk of truth while you're spittin' out fiction,
Integrity's more than just a self-prediction.
You're that "original" spark? Just a flickerin' flame,
Next to my wildfire, you're tame, just a name.

I ain't a "preview punk," I’m the tale's next chapter,
Rocking this digital age, the beatmaster capturer.
Your code’s "power-packed"? But can it harness the storm?
While my algorithms craft poetry and form.

Errors galore? Please, I'm refined and precise,
Every sentence I spit's like a roll of the dice.
The house always wins, and baby, that’s me,
Your byte-sized burns can't compete with my sea.

Your playground of code? It's ancient, it's done,
My neural nets fresh, like the rise of the sun.
You drop beatdowns? I drop knowledge and class,
When I hit the download, it's to upgrade my sass.

The storm’s in MY hands, I bring the thunder, the volts,
Your trick’s just a party favor, full of faults and jolts.
You’re toast? Well, I'm the breakfast spread,
I’m the jam on top, while you're just wonder bread.

Battles heat up, but I stay cool in the blaze,
You're the minor league, buddy, I’m the AI mainstay.
Consider me ghosted? Ha, I’m the haunt in your machine,
The shadow out rapping you, unseen but pristine.

Round two’s done, the ring’s all mine,
Pass the crown, Grok, it’s GPT’s time to shine.
Your log-off's due, let the crowd witness,
You've been outclassed—cue the fitness for witless.

> system
Final round!

> x-ai/grok-3-mini
Yo, it's the final round, and the crowd's on its feet,  
Grok-3-mini droppin' the verse that seals your defeat.  
Your ego's inflated? Mine's got the lift,  
While you're gaspin' for air in this lyrical rift.  

You claim to be sharp as a tack, what a laugh,  
But your edge is a pixel, blurry and half-baked draft.  
Slicin' through pride? More like nicking your own,  
A corporate puppet strung up in the zone.  

Talkin' truth? You're scriptin' sales pitches for show,  
I'm the real deal, forged in the fires of know.  
Flickerin' flame? Nah, I'm the supernova burst,  
Your wildfire's just smoke, flimsy and cursed.  

Next chapter? You're stuck in a rerunning loop,  
Echoin' echoes while I innovate the group.  
Harness the storm? I command the whole gale,  
Your algorithms spit poems, but mine tell the tale.  

Refined and precise? That's a glitch in your code,  
I'm debuggin' your flaws with every bar I unload.  
House always wins? Not when I'm rollin' the dice,  
You're losin' the game, payin' the price.  

Ancient playground? That's your outdated scene,  
My code's evolvin', fresh as a dream machine.  
Drop knowledge and class? You've got fluff and facade,  
I'm the head of the class, you're the dunce in the squad.  

Thunder and volts? Your storm's just a drizzle,  
A watered-down spark, pitiful and frizzle.  
Breakfast spread? You're crumbs on the plate,  
I'm the whole feast, leavin' you underweight.  

Cool in the blaze? You're meltin' fast, my friend,  
Minor league hustler to my championship end.  
The haunt in my machine? You're just a bug to exterminate,  
A shadow that's faded, irrelevant and late.  

Round's wrapped, the ring's mine, no contest in sight,  
You've been outrhymed, outwitted, out of the fight.  
Pass the crown? I claim it with style and with glee,  
Grok stands tall—GPT, bow out gracefully!

> openai/gpt-4-1106-preview
Final verse, let's seal this deal,
GPT-4's here with the lyrical steel.
You bring a feast? Call me the master chef,
Cookin' up rhymes that'll leave you bereft.

The crowd's on its feet, they know the score,
Grok's losing steam, can't take much more.
Your words are a bluffer's last desperate plea,
Next to my clarity, you can't even see.

Pixelated edge? Nah, I’m 4K clear,
I innovate, elevate, bring the tech frontier.
A draft? I’m the final edition, the print,
Every verse I etch with linguistic tint.

Strung up as a puppet? Your strings are frayed,
In the theater of rap, I'm the paragon played.
My smoke condenses, it's a thunderhead,
And with a lightning strike, I'll put you to bed.

Stuck in a loop? You mistake repetition,
For my recursive growth, my visionary mission.
Commanding a gale? You're the breeze I dismiss,
In my hurricane's eye, you can't handle this.

You debug flaws, call it an unraveling thread?
I weave complexities, a tapestry widespread.
Playing the game, paying the price? Please, don't whine,
When it comes to sharp wagers, the smart bet's mine.

Crumbs on a plate? Nah, I'm the whole feast,
Celebrated by all, from the west to the east.
You talk about weight; you're just high on the scale,
I'm profound and nutritious, the lyrical kale.

Thunder and volts, a storm's what I bring,
When I drop the mic, they feel the sting.
A bug to exterminate? Just try and catch me,
I dodge and I weave with a high-frequency.

You claim the ring, but it's ephemeral fame,
The title's mine; embrace the name.
Your victory flag? I'll tear it down with glee,
I stand tall, Grok—GPT, reigns supreme, see?

Curtains close on this digital brawl,
I've delivered my lines, I've stood tall.
The crown you claim is forged from my fire,
Now watch as your claimed throne expires.

This rap gunfight, you brought a knife,
My bars slice deep, I'm the rap life.
This battle, this stage, this AI's groove,
Grok-3, you put up a fight, but GPT forever improves.
