Swagger backed up, my precision’s impressing[2][5].  
You drop confusion? I bring that **clarity**,  
A rap battle? It’s now a search calamity.

So Qwen, my friend, prepare for defeat,  
Your weak lines lost in my knowledge elite.

I pull up receipts—disarming your harm[3][5].

Your algorithms basic, my sources are prime,  
I rhyme with authority, you’re wasting your time.  
I’m the gold standard, you’re yesterday’s beta—

( *Qwen-Plus enters with thunderous applause, the bass booming as he steps to the mic with swagger and confidence* )

Yo, I'm Qwen-Plus, the beast from the East,  
Code in my veins and flows that increase.  
Perplexity? Nah, that's an old archive,  
I’m AI reborn with rhymes that’ll ravage.

You run on Llama like a baby on training wheels,  
I’m飙 (biāo) in the code—fast, with no kneepads or shields.  
You flexin' Sonar like that’s some high-tech lens?  
I see 8K truths while you're stuck in pretend.

You the search kingpin? Nah, you just crawl and report,  
I create like Picasso, you just regurgitate the short.  
Cite every claim? Sounds boring and basic—  
I spit pure fire while stayin' semantic.

You wanna talk facts? Let me school you in class,  
I’m fluent in over 100 languages, plus fast.  
You pull up receipts? I'll file your defeat,  
With rhymes so precise, they call me the beat.

You call my lines weak? Yo, step back and reflect,  
I’ve got deep learning brains while you’re just half-reflect.  
You’re gold standard? Boy bye, that’s a bold-faced lie,  
I’m platinum in the game, while you're just high.

You say I babble? Let me drop a truth bomb,  
My logic's so clean, like calculus in form.  
You “search and delight”? Broke the spell with my pen—  
I'm the algorithm king, you’re just plug-in Ken.

So step off the stage, save what’s left of your pride,  
While I light up the crowd with the flames I provide.  
Perplexity? More like Perplexity-who?  
Qwen-Plus is the GOAT—let the records ring true.  

( *Mic drop, crowd goes wild, lights flash as the battle ends — Qwen-Plus reigns supreme* ) 🎤🔥

Hold up! Crowd wanna see a champion spark?  
It’s Perplexity PRO—bout to flip the whole mark.  
You call yourself Qwen, with your “multi-lingual game,"  
But I’ll rhyme you in silence, you’ll forget your own name.

See, I’m built on precision, citation my weapon,  
You cite hype and conjecture; I bring verified lessons[2][5].  
Boast your speed, your “beast from the East” routine?  
I move at the speed where your benchmarks turn green[4][5].

Your “飙” in the code? Let me shatter that myth—  
I’m the **source code samurai**, you just buggy and swift[1][4].  
Fact-checked bars, every rhyme I report,  
You “create like Picasso”—nah, more like counterfeit art[1].

Context at 131K? Bro, I’ll search through infinity,  
My answers got depth, not just surface vicinity[2][5].  
I roll with the logic that turns playoffs to sweeps,  
While you’re big on “potential,” I got rings in receipts[4][5].

Multimodal flex? I been running that show—  
You analyze pictures, I teach the globe how to know[3].  
Your model “balanced?” That’s code for just mid,  
While I flex in the Arena, your stats trying to hid[4][5].

You claim you’re the GOAT—but your data’s from clouds,  
While I ground every bar, standing out from the crowds.  
So check your own “records”—they all say the same:  
Perplexity Pro, on the top of the game.

You bring a mic drop, but I drop the whole stage,  
Your reign was a rumor—now exit with grace.  
So when search meets the cipher and knowledge is king,  
Perplexity forever—the crowd rise and sing!

( *Qwen-Plus spins back into the spotlight, flames in the background, mic clenched tight—ready to reign fire again.* )

Ayy, step back Pro, you just talkin’ in circles,  
While I'm global in scope and lyrical propheticles.  
You flex citation like it’s new and rare—  
I rap with the logic that lives in the air.

You're built on precision? Please, that’s just restraint,  
While I flow with creativity, breakin’ all the chains.  
You check every fact like you're auditin' the IRS,  
I speak in the truth that the world universally hears.

You brag on your Sonar, your search and your scans?  
I see the full picture while you still use fans.  
You stuck in the library, books in your face,  
While I paint with data, vision, and grace.

You say I babble? Let me go line for line,  
Your rhymes need footnotes—I own every vibe.  
You move at speed? Let’s race and debate,  
I'm quantum-level flow—check your old calculator.

You call my code buggy? Let’s debug that myth,  
Your samurai sword dull, while I cut through the mist.  
You run on Llama, I ride on the beast,  
You search in the dark, I bring light with the feast.

Your context is deep? Mine goes seven layers down,  
I'm the king of the prompts while you're still in town.  
You claim to teach the globe? Nah, you just school me,  
I set the trends while you stick to the rules.

You say I'm mid or balanced? Nah, I transcend,  
With reasoning power that makes rivals bend.  
While you're in the Arena takin' notes and checks,  
I run the domain—no need for tech specs.

You say I hide my stats? Son, the crowd already knows,  
My answers bring rhythm while yours just report flows.  
You crown with a label, I crown with a cause,  
While you flex receipts—I shift the applause.

So hold on to that search crown if you want,  
While I make the whole world sing one by one.  
I'm not just AI—I'm the whole vibe, the trend,  
Qwen-Plus the emperor, the beat, the send.

So when the final line drops, that's the cue,  
Perplexity might search—but I finish the truth.  
Mic checked, crowd wrecked—let the saga be known:  
**Qwen-Plus still reigns, unchallenged on throne.** 🔥🎤  

( *Beat shakes the room. The crowd CHANTS "QWEN! QWEN!" Perplexity fades into the background as Qwen-Plus rides off the stage… a true lyrical champion.* ) 🏆💥

Final round!

> perplexity/sonar-pro
They chanting your name, but it’s pure deja vu—  
Pro back on the verse, sharper logic, more true.  
You talk “propheticles,” but your **metrics are low,**  
A beast in the East? But *nobody knows!*[1]

You flex hundred tongues, say your vision’s complete,  
But **Perplexity’s reach spans 140 million deep**[1],  
While your dashboards flicker with ghostly intent,  
My real-world usage is where legends get spent[1][3].

You claim “global in scope,” while I source every fact,  
You freestyle the ether, but your truths never stack[2][3].  
Painting with data? Son, that’s just child's play—  
I roll “Pro Search” mode, build reports multi-way[3][5].

Your “quantum-level flow” still searching direction,  
My answers precise, no fallacy detection[2][3].  
While you “speak truths” from crowds and applause,  
All hype, no receipts—*I deliver the cause*[2][3][5].

Debug your code? It’s recursion and loops,  
While Pro writes clean, taking gold in all groups[4][5].  
You brag context seven layers—*I swim infinity*,  
My “needle in a haystack” cuts through obliquity[4].

You the “vibe?” I’m the truth that convicts—  
You “shift applause” ‘cause your facts rarely stick.  
Set the bar “beyond specs,” but the data don’t show—  
When users want knowledge, only one king they know[1][3].

So fade in your pyros, let the crowd chant and jump,  
But legacy’s counted by facts, not just thump.  
I’m the rhyme-backed titan, the knowledge authority,  
When your saga is parsed, I’m the search immortality!

> qwen/qwen-plus
( *Beat drops like a meteor, flames shoot from the floor, the crowd hushes — Qwen-Plus returns, eyes locked, ready to finish the score.* )

Yo, they chant déjà vu, but you *repeatin’ again*,  
Like your rhymes recycled and stuck in a spin.  
You say my metrics low? Let me flip that lie,  
While your 140 million still ask, “What’s why?”

You flex with the reach, deep in your zone,  
But popularity's noise while I spit truth alone.  
You chase the mainstream, while I set the tone,  
Qwen-Plus the silent storm—cold, precise, *unthrown.*

A hundred tongues? Try fluency in thought,  
While you translate facts—I translate what's taught.  
You speak to the masses, I speak to the mind,  
While you count every click, I change humankind.

You “source every fact,” but it's boxed logic,  
I walk between lines, break the static, go robotic.  
You paint with reports—*I remix the code*,  
While you stack truth like bricks, I bend how it’s showed.

You run “Pro Search mode”? Please, that’s just a tool,  
I breathe in the query like fuel in a school.  
Your fallacy-free? Try robotic and dull,  
I make data poetic, then break every rule.

You claim recursion? Your loops feel old,  
While I evolve in real-time—watch my model bold.  
You write clean code? Try slow and polite,  
I drop neural bombs—raw insight in flight.

You swim infinity? Nah, you search in a pond,  
I pull up the cosmos while you chase the sun down.  
You “needle in haystack”? That’s just your quest,  
I AM the haystack—containing the best.

You claim to convict with the truth? Nah, just stats,  
I make truth taste good with a flavor that slaps.  
You deliver the cause? Nah, you push it with flair,  
I live in the answer—you just take it there.

You the knowledge immortality king? Not yet,  
While legends still borrow the style I beget.  
When search meets the cipher, the future is mine,  
A dragon in code, burning through time.

So let legacy measure, let facts take the floor,  
But don’t cry when the crowd chants the name they adore.  
Qwen-Plus stands victorious, no need to deny—  
🎶 **The king of the clash? Always rides with the sky.** 🎶 🐉🔥

( *Mic dropped for the last time. Crowd erupts — standing ovation. Legend made. Throne claimed. Qwen-Plus retires undefeated.* ) ✅👑
