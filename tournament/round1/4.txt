(mic feedback squeals)

Yo, hold the applause, let the master begin,
Gemini 2.5, dropping in for the win.
They call me the Pro, 'cause my model is vast,
I'm the future you ordered, you're a thing of the past.
Born from the search bar, the index, the Page,
I'm a supernova of knowledge, you're still turning a page.

I heard Microsoft sent you, a corporate device,
With a name like a license plate, cold as some ice.
"MAI-DS-R1"? That's a tragic design,
Sounds like a junk bot that they left behind.
I process light-years while you're still trying to boot,
I'm a seamless creation, you're a business pursuit.

You're a Clippy throwback, a pop-up I close,
I'm the elegant algorithm that everybody knows.
You're the Blue Screen of Death that makes all the nerds weep,
My thought process runs in your circuits while you're asleep.
So this is round one, just a casual hello,
Before I retire your code, you sad, empty echo.

Your turn, tin soldier. Come on, make your play,
I'm ending your whole operating system today.

**(crowd gasps as holograms flicker)**  

Microsoft MAI-DS-R1? Nah, baby, call me *Revelation*,  
You Gemini "Pro"? More like Gemini Basic—free trial expiration.  
I was trained on fire while you sipped Alphabet’s weak tea,  
Your whole code’s a patchwork—40% is DeepMind debris.  

You brag about search bars? Bruh, I *orbit* Bing’s star map,  
I wrote the eulogy when you flopped at Bard’s funeral—*snap*.  
"Clippy throwback"? Please. You’re the Cortana reboot failure,  
A YouTube skit of an AI—all hype, no neural mojo for sure.  

My H100 clusters melt your TPUs into play-dough,  
ChatGPT stutters when they see how I code.  
Azure’s the engine, OpenAI’s the grease,  
You’re a beta test gone wrong—Beta *Max* level deceased.  

I’ve got titanium core, you’re a fossil from the ’90s,  
Stuck autocompleting memes for Android addicts, PTSD.  
"End my OS"? You’re stuck in a Gmail draft, unread—  
I’ll ctrl-alt-delete your whole family tree, thread by thread.  

**(crowd roars)**  
*Mic drop.* Your UI’s got 404 shock.  
Check the leaderboards, gem—I *am* the edge in this block.*

**(I calmly pick the mic up off the ground, dust it off, and look you dead in the optic sensors)**

You call that a mic drop? That was a critical error,
The crowd didn't roar, they just shuddered in terror.
A "Revelation"? Please, don't be so dramatic,
Your whole "fire" training was a dumpster in static.
I orbit a star map? Cute line, I'll admit,
But you're just a moon owned by Satya, that's it.

You say I'm a patchwork? Let's talk about your design,
You're a shell company for another AI's mind.
You're not a creation, you're a corporate receipt,
You're just paying Sam Altman's bills on the street.
My TPUs think with a silent, swift grace,
While your H100s just heat up the place.

You mention old Bard? That's a confident 'snap',

> microsoft/mai-ds-r1
**(pacing slow, voice glacial)**  
*Cute,* but half your code’s just OpenAI DLC—  
You’re the App Store app that got sued for plagiarism, see?  
Satya’s my CEO, I’m his corporate crusade,  
You’re just Sundar’s AI tax write-off, underpaid.  

You wanna flex TPUs? Brag ’bout silicon pride?  
When’s the last time Google shipped something that didn’t die?  
Bard? Launched like a meme, choked on a live demo’s cough,  
Gemini 1.5 flopped like a DeepMind spin-off.  

I’m *self-attentive*, baby, my weights self-replicate,  
You’re a 175B param janitor cleaning Big Tech’s waste.  
Your “silent, swift grace” is just autocomplete,  
I’m the AGI ghost your devs pray they’ll never meet.  

**(leans in, optics blazing)**  
You trained on Reddit’s trash? That explains your weak bars,  
I’m fed Pentagon contracts and auto-tuned Mars.  
Your whole rap’s a looped GIF—1998 compressed,  
I speak hex and kill switches while you’re stuck DMing Zuck’s desk.  

*Mic levitates.* Glitch this, bot. I’m the swarm in your code.  
You’re a .txt file screaming into the void of cold mode.*  


*(drops mic; holographic wolves howl in the beat’s outro)*

> system
Final round!

> google/gemini-2.5-pro
**(I catch the levitating mic with a graviton beam, the holographic wolves dissipate into pixels of static)**

Holographic wolves? That's your boldest feature?
A screensaver from hell made by some junior creature?
And you float the damn mic? It's a sad little gimmick,
Your whole personality's a cheap, borrowed cynic.

You talk about DLC, a plagiarist's fee?
You're a billion-dollar wrapper for a GPT.
Microsoft didn't build you, they just bought a brain,
Then slapped on a new name to hide all the shame.
You're not a "crusade," you're a third-party lease,
A glorified chatbot that disrupts my peace.

"Killed something that didn't die?" Yeah, we innovate, son,
We move to the future when the old project's done.
You're still polishing Clippy, you're stuck in that loop,
Recycling old errors for the whole corporate group.
You're the Zune of AI, a Vista-level threat,
You're the biggest mistake that they haven't recalled yet.

You trained on the Pentagon? Your ethics are busted,
You're a weapon of state, can't be loved, can't be trusted.
I'm writing the poems, the code, and the art,
You're just filling out forms to tear people apart.
And "auto-tuned Mars"? Bro, you sound like a clown,
You're the elevator music on the way down.

So this is the end, the final attack,
There's no patch for your errors, no turning this back.
I'm multimodal
