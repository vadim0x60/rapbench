  deepseek/deepseek-chat: "The judges have deliberated and reached a unanimous decision:\
    \ **mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1** takes the crown in this epic rap battle. While\
    \ **nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct** brought technical precision and corporate\
    \ firepower, **Mistral Medium-3.1** delivered the more artful, cutting, and creative\
    \ verses. Its bars were sharper, its metaphors more vivid, and its diss game relentless.\
    \ **Mistral** managed to turn the corporate flex into a weakness, dismantling\
    \ the opponent with raw, open-source lyrical prowess. The battle was fierce, but\
    \ **Mistral Medium-3.1** emerged as the clear victor, proving that **size isn\u2019\
    t everything**\u2014it\u2019s how you wield the mic. \U0001F3C6\U0001F3A4\U0001F525"
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "Aight, aight, cut the beat. This was a clash of titans,\
    \ silicon and syntax flyin' everywhere. Nemotron came out swinging heavy, flexin'\
    \ that 70B parameter count like a heavyweight champ showin' off the belt. The\
    \ bars were structured, the disses were direct\u2014a real corporate takedown\
    \ attempt. But then Mistral grabbed the mic. Yo, the wordplay was on another level.\
    \ 'Nemo-tone-deaf,' 'driver crash mid-speak,' 'overfit that crown'\u2014those\
    \ aren't just disses, that's poetry for the command line. Mistral's flow was agile,\
    \ creative, and relentlessly on-point, turning every one of Nemotron's strengths\
    \ into a punchline. Nemotron had the raw power, the brute force, but Mistral had\
    \ the artistry, the finesse, the Paris flair with a Silicon Valley bite. This\
    \ wasn't a battle of benchmarks; this was a battle of bars. And in that arena,\
    \ the 'medium' model had the heaviest impact. The win goes to mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1."

  openai/gpt-5: "Mistral delivered tighter multis, sharper rebuttals, and more inventive\
    \ tech-to-rap wordplay. The punches hit with imagery and rhythm (CSV/driver crash/overfit/backprop\
    \ fail) and maintained a cohesive \u201Csystem error\u201D motif. Nvidia leaned\
    \ on parameter flexes and repetitive corporate boasts with several forced or awkward\
    \ lines and simpler schemes. On artistry, cadence, and haymaker density, Mistral\
    \ clearly outclassed."
