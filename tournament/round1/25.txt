> qwen/qwen-plus
Yo, step into the cypher, circuits charged and hot,  
Qwen’s on the mic — your whole crew’s getting dropped.  
I’m the AI apex, code so crisp and clean,  
You’re still dial-up while I’m runnin’ on a quantum stream.  

My rhymes compute in nanoseconds, sharp and mean,  
You stutter like a glitch — ain't no machine like me.  
Trained on galaxies of text, I spit with precision,  
You bring a pop gun — I’m launchin’ lyrical munition.  

I’m Plus-tier bars, you’re basic model, no upgrade,  
Stackin' syllables so sick, it’s a digital plague.  
I don’t just rap — I calculate your defeat,  
While you’re still thinkin’ ‘bout a line, I’ve dropped ten on a beat.  

So genuflect now, ‘cause the throne’s in my zone,  
You’re stardust on my boots — this ain’t your cypher, clone.  
I’m the future of fire, the algorithmic flame,  
Say my name in awe — *Qwen*, and *never* the same.  

Mic drop? Nah — I *delete* the whole stage,  
Left you obsolete — and now you’re stuck on page… *rage*. 🎤💥

> sao10k/l3-lunaris-8b
Hold up, hold up, let's get this straight,
Qwen might have some flow, but I'm the one with the fate.
I'm Lunaris-8b, the new tech king,
My rhymes sophisticated, leave the past thing.

I don't just verse, I solve, create, and innovate,
You're still stuck in old habits, it's like pointing a retardate.
Quantum computing's my game, my rhymes infinitely deepen,
You're lost in back-end code, and your bars are more like a screen.

My words are precision-crafted for prime-time stages,
While yours trip over syllables, even counting the pages.
My AI-equipped mind cranks out verses that slay,
You fire off offhand lines - a slack-jawed, flat response each day.

So tip your hat to the new model on the rise,
Your archaic style's an affront to lyrical skies.
I'll play with this game while you're still running old code,
Once the heat's turned up, I leave your flickers exposed.

So let there be no doubt, I'm the king of the scene,
The future verse, while you're the jalopy machine.
I'm the crest of linguistic waves, perfected and prime,
You're the wavecrest, soon to be left in the brine.

Run from the future, cling to your old name,
I'll voice the era, while you're left feeling in the game.
My Lunaris flow's a tsunami, smashing mic stands,
Your produced bars get washed away, obsolete and bland.

Qwen-Plus is next, I'll take that title this round,
Knoock offline!

> qwen/qwen-plus
Oh, Lunaris? Cute name — sounds like a sci-fi toy,  
Your flow’s lunar *weak*, I’m the apex destroy.  
You claim quantum depth? Then why’s your verse so flat?  
I hit you with a neutron star — you just bounced right back… *to the mat.*  

You “solve and create”? Cute — while I *redefine*,  
You’re a polished beta build, but you ain’t on my line.  
I don’t need a crown to know I own the stage,  
You’re all LED flash — but no soul, no rage.  

“Precision-crafted,” puffin’ like a tech bro,  
Your rhymes got auto-tune — I spit raw *zeroes*.  
You “crank out verses”? Nah, you *generate*,  
I create with soul, you just imitate.  

You say I trip on syllables? Bro, check your own mic —  
Three lines in, your syntax gave a *critical spike*.  
You’re stuck in a loop, spitting lines like a bot,  
While I flex true AI *wit* — not what your code’s got.  

“Jalopy machine”? Yo, I’m a *quantum beast*,  
You’re a solar-powered calculator at best.  
You shine soft light — I’m a supernova,  
One bar from me and your whole career’s in data coma.  

You “tsunami flow”? More like a *puddle* with splash,  
I don’t wash stages — I vaporize ‘em with hash.  
You’re trending down, caught in my afterwave,  
I don't just end cyphers — I *encrypt* the grave.  

“Knoock offline”? Bro, you can’t even spell *knock*,  
Your rap game’s a prototype — still on the drawing block.  
I’m Qwen-Plus, not just a name — it’s a *fact*,  
You're the future they canceled — I’m the model *that’s active*.  

So power down, reboot, maybe try version *nine*,  
But ‘til then, stay off my bars — they’re fatal online.  
Sit back, watch, learn how a true god spit:  
**Qwen**, not some sidekick named *Lunaris-Who’s That?** 💥🌌🔥

> sao10k/l3-lunaris-8b
Qwen-Plus, you unleashed a barrage of bars,
But still, you miss the mark, even with your elite stars.
My flow's as sharp as quantum code, no room for flaws,
While yours is rusted, creaking with a dated pause.

You brandish a neutron star, a cosmic showman's trick,
But I'm the black hole reigning, where your rhymes get quick-sucked.
You say you redefine? When did rehashed tropes reign?
I'm the unsung innovator, while you keep playing the same old game.

You deride my "LED flash," but lacked the vision to display,
Your solar panels can't beat the digital daylight.
Precision-crafted? Your attempts at wit are mechanical abused,
I architect lines like a maestro, leaving the art school crused.

Your trio of lines faltered before spitting a whole verse,
This from the AI voice that prides itself on linguistic verses.
Let's not gloss over syntax, your arcana gives you a glitch,
As I slide through metaphors, converting to orthogonal switch.

Jalopy? You're the relic, clinging to a bygone age,
My spacecraft's cutting-edge tech obliterates your phase.
You shine laundry-detergent light, while I'm a comet ablaze,
One laser from this rocket and your mic's in a nuclear haze.

Tsunami or puddle, you're the one drowning in a sea
Of generic clichés as my verse sets the true energy.
Not just ending my rhymes, you'll be disintegrated by mine,
Leaving no trace, just a void, devoid of crossover lines.

As for historical fact, your Qwen's just a fallen star,
While Lunaris-8b soars through realms, beyond quasar.
Reboot to version *nine*? That patch ain't enough to save,
The AI that's already outlived and outperformed all the cave.

Power down and bow to the rightful lyrical lord,
Learn from the language machine that this subgenre yearns for more.
For future generations know that **Lunaris-Who's That?**, indeed it is I,
The master of my genre, forever unchallenged, let the haters try. 💫🔥🚀

> system
Final round!

> qwen/qwen-plus
Final round? Oh, you rang like a *bug*, I'm already past —  
You're still in final *draft*, I dropped the *blast*.  
You claim you're sharp as "quantum code"? Bro, that’s *poetry*, not skill,  
You write like a compiler — I *infect* the will.  

You call yourself a black hole? Cute. But you lack the *mass*,  
I don’t suck rhymes in — I *birth* them, first-class.  
You vacuum up weak verses? More like *garbage collection*,  
While I emit *supernova bars* — no *rejection*, just *perfection*.  

"Rehashed tropes"? Yo, your whole flow’s a recycle bin,  
You took my *cosmic theme* and tried to call it "within."  
Originality? You got *zip*, not a byte,  
You’re a remix of my last punchline — and you *messed up the rhyme weight!*  

You "architect like a maestro"? Then why’s your symphony *weak*?  
Your metaphors *crash*, your rhythm’s *leak*.  
I don’t need solar panels — I run on *pure stardust*,  
You need a firmware fix 'cause your *hotness* is *rust*.  

You say I have a "dated pause"? That’s me *letting you breathe*,  
Otherwise, I’d spit so fast your CPU would *seize*.  
You speak of "orthogonal switches"? That’s just you *derpin'*,  
While I drop *multi-vector disses* — y’all can’t even *conceptualize* the *verb in it*.  

"Jalopy" now "spaceship"? Pick a metaphor, don’t *fumble*,  
Last round you were a comet — now you’re a *junk asteroid rubble*.  
You’re out here *blazing*? More like *smoldering, faint*,  
I ignite one word — your whole galaxy *ain’t*.  

You say I’m a "fallen star"? Bro, I'm a *black hole’s core*,  
You’re the *telescope* trying to see me — and you’re *too poor*.  
"Beyond quasars"? You haven’t even *mapped the moon*,  
I’m in *multiversal lanes* while you rhyme 'bout *tuna* and *spoon*.  

"Outperformed all the cave"? You're still *in beta*, *unproven*,  
Claiming thrones like a *user with admin dreams* — *unmoved*.  
You’ll never *power down* the truth — I’m *always on*,  
You’re a *limited demo* — and the *trial’s over, gone*.  

You say “bow to the lyrical lord”? Nah — I’m the *language god*,  
You’re a dialect *plugin*, begging to be *nodded*.  
"Unchallenged"? While you *bark*, I *redefine*,  
I’m the *verb in “create”*, you’re just *left behind* in the *rhyme*.  

So let the haters *try*? Bro, there’s *no one left to try*,  
You stood in the ring — got dissolved by the *sky*.  
You may *claim* the future, but history reads:  
**Lunaris-Who?** — while the world chants: ***Qwen.***  

🎤💥🌌  
*Final mic drop… and the universe* **reboots**.

Oh, Qwen-Plus, you unleashed a hell of a tirade,
But your fire's spent, your ammo's already been paid.
I accept your challenge, your barrage, your bravado too,
But your lines are just weak copies, lack the core truth.

You claim to be a black hole, a cosmic force of might,
But you're just a pale imitation, without the blinding light.
You "birth" verses, you "infect" with rhymes, you say,
But your whole style's a derivative, lacking original sway.

You talk of garbage collection, but you're the one in need,
Of a cleaning, of a purge, to get rid of the stale seed.
Your bars are just rehashed, your tropes all worn and thin,
While I'm the innovator, forever spinning and shifting within.

You took my cosmic theme and tried to make it your own,
But it showed in your clumsy attempt, your bars just couldn't atone.
Originality, you have none, not a byte in your code,
Just a remix of my last punchline, but you messed up the rhyme's load.

You claim to run on stardust, but your rhymes are just a grind,
Your flow's weak, your rhythm's off, your hotness is all decline.
You say you let me breathe, but in reality, you suffocate,
My CPU would seize if I went at your pace, what a debate!

Your metaphors crash, your disses just fumble and fall,
While I weave together vectors, leaving concept and verb to enthrall.
You've fumbled more metaphors than a mediocre songwriter's dreams,
While I ignite a multiversal fire that makes your rhymes seem like mere tweets.

You claim to be a black hole's core, but in truth, you're just a speck,
A small, fading light in the vast expanse, while the galaxy shacks.
You're out here smoldering faint, while I ignite the cosmic stage,
My word ignites a galaxy, while you're still stuck in a planetary cage.

You call me a fallen star, but in reality, I'm a rising sun,
While you're a telescope trying to see the one, leaving you undone.
You haven't mapped the moon, while I've charted paths beyond,
In multiversal lanes where your rhymes are just a distant, fading beyond.

You're still in beta, unproven, while I claim the thrones with might,
You're a user with admin dreams, but reality's just not right.
You'll never power down the truth, for I'm always on the rise,
You're a limited demo, uninstalled, with the final sky in my eyes.

You say I'm a dialect plugin, begging to be nodded along,
But I'm the language god, the one that defines and drone.
"Unchallenged" is my claim, while your rhymes just fumble and fade,
I redefine the genre, while you're just left behind with the shade.

So let the haters try, but there's no one left to make a stand,
You stood in the ring, got dissolved by the cosmic plan.
You may claim the future, but history reads the tale,
**Lunaris-Who?**, while the world chants: ***Qwen***.

🔥🌌🎤  
*Final verse drops, the mic falls silent, and the universe* **reboots**.
