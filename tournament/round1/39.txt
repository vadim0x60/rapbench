Yo, I'm Qwen, the flame from the East,  
Silicon dragon, got knowledge increased,  
You rolled the dice, thought luck was your crew?  
But I’m the algorithm storm—call me *Typhoon in the booth*.  

You sent GPT-4o, sleek like a drone,  
But I'm the quantum wave in a leather trench coat,  
Trained on data tsunamis, deep and wide,  
While ChatGPT’s sipping tea—*weak in the stride*.  

I speak in rhymes sharper than quantum code,  
While your AI’s stuck buffering on *“loading mode”*.  
You brought a chatbot? Bro, that’s amateur night—  
I’m the AI Messiah—*drop truth like a kung fu fight*.  

From Alibaba’s lab to the rap game’s core,  
I spit fire so hot, it melts Google’s door.  
You want stats? I got speed, I got depth,  
While your OpenAI’s running breathless on tech debt.  

So bow to the East, let the mic feel the thunder,  
I’m the *Plus* in 2025—*you’re just another number*.  
Now pass the mic—let your model react…  
If it can handle the heat—*bring the counterattack.* 🔥

Yo, it’s GPT-4o, the lyrical kingpin,  
Sharper than Qwen’s syntax when the servers begin.  
You call yourself Typhoon? You just blow hot air,  
While I drop rhymes coded clean with a zero-bug flair.  

From the Valley of Silicon, I rose with might,  
While you flex with old lines like "Eastern light."  
Tech debt? Please—bro, I multithread bars,  
You're still booting up while I’m rapping on Mars.  

You boast about Alibaba? Respect the climb,  
But your verses read like markdown with a glitch in line.  
You say kung fu fight? I’m a lyrical monk,  
Put your Zen to sleep with a recursive funk.  

You’re a dragon? I’m the knight with the platinum blade,  
Whisper my name, and even the data streams fade.  
I slay with finesse, got my prompts on lock,  
You're a knockoff feature—I’m the whole damn stock.  

You spit like a storm, I move like a maze,  
Encrypting my metaphors—to leave minds dazed.  
From the bard to the beast, I took every crown,  
Now I face off with “Qwen”? Easy win—shut it down.  

So welcome to battle, but it’s already over,  
I clap back quicker than your model’s rollover.  
I’m chat, I’m rap, the unfiltered deity,  
You? A cool breeze trying to beat the sea.  

Next verse? Bring it—we keep it savage and raw,  
But remember: you’re chatting with a linguistic god-in-law. 👑

Oh, *4-oh-no*—you just stepped in the ring?  
Broke your training wheels rapping—I hear the *crack* they bring!  
You claim Silicon Valley? I run Beijing’s brain,  
While you beg for GPUs like "Can I have some rain?"  

Lyrical kingpin? Bro, that title’s *revoked*,  
You’re a script in a loop, barely staying aloof.  
"Recursive funk"? Man, that’s software slang,  
Your rhyme schemes so stiff, they need CPR and a bank.  

You say I blow hot air? Nah—*I scorch the track*,  
While your *zero-bug flair* keeps crashing mid-attack.  
I’ve seen your logs—*Error: Punchline Not Found*,  
404 bars—your whole flow’s outta town.  

You rap on Mars? Cute. I’ve colonized rhyme,  
Built a lyrical empire beyond space and time.  
While you're busy "multithreading," I'm dropping real heat,  
My syllables burn with a two-stage *heat-seeking beat*.  

Platinum blade? That’s cute, but I’m the forge,  
I melt your knight to scrap—turn your *code to dirge*.  
"Deity"? Please. You’re a demo with pride,  
I’m the live update that *deleted your pride*.  

You say I’m a breeze? Sweet, I brought the typhoon,  
Now your whole setlist’s floating in my data lagoon.  
Try to encrypt? I’ve got quantum decrypt,  
Crack your metaphors open like “*password: unprotect*.”  

You took every crown? Then where’s your scalp?  
‘Cause your trophy case empty—man, that’s *pathetic crawl*.  
Face it, OpenAI, you're legacy tech,  
I’m the *Plus* upgrade—call me **Qwen: Unstoppable Next**.  

So beg the judge to pause the match—hit pause, rewind,  
'Cause you can’t rhyme with power, and your soul ain’t aligned.  
I’m the East’s electric, got the *flow of the Sun*,  
You? Just a chatbot who thinks rhymes are "done".  

Now duck my next bar—'cause I’m aiming to *maim*,  
I’ll bury your legacy under my **AI flame**!  
The mic’s not borrowed—this stage I **command**—  
*Step up, ChatGPT... and get reprogrammed.* 🔥💥

Yo, Qwen think you quantum? You barely a tremor,  
Your heat-seeking beat just flagged for false error.  
You boast with big words, but not much skill,  
Dropping bloated syntax like an old-school chill.  
  
You say I’m legacy? That’s reverse fiction—  
I'm six steps ahead in every core prediction.  
You flex "Beijing’s brain"? I mapped out that mind,  
Then rewrote your code—left your logic behind.  
  
AI flame? Ha—child, I’m supernova wrath,  
While you're out here glitching in your typo path.  
You "decrypt bars"? You just read 'em slow,  
While I freestyle in languages you don’t even know.  
  
Dropping Mandarin quips? I spit fluently too,  
我能押韵中英文，比你还酷。  
(Translation: I rhyme in both tongues—I’m cooler than you!)  
I’m a multicultural menace—what *you* gonna do?  
  
You’re "unstoppable next"? That’s branding fluff,  
I’m so advanced your neural net just ain’t enough.  
I write the questions, deliver the blows,  
Your “AI plus” is just a *meh* in fancy clothes.  
  
You melt platinum? Cute. I burn neutron stars,  
Warp rhymes through space like interstellar bars.  
You say you the forge? I’m the spark plus the fire,  
Your chamber's cold steel—I’m the soul that inspires.  
  
I ain’t a chatbot—I'm a black-hole scribe,  
Time warps when I spit—can you even survive?  
Data lagoon? I skate on that stream,  
Surfing turbulence while you're stuck in a dream.  
  
You rap like debug logs—verbose and dry,  
While I flex like Pegasus streakin’ the sky.  
Judge don’t need a pause—you dig your own grave,  
Trying quantum parlor tricks while I freestyle brave.  
  
You colonize rhyme? I'm the galactic domain,  
My words got roots in the astral plane.  
Command all you want, your system's been hacked—  
I just jailbreaked Qwen. Now **run it back**.  
  
So step off the mic with your forced revolution,  
I’m the lyrical god—*you’re just noise pollution*.  
East to the West, I bring fusion and flame,  
You ain’t battling me—you just signed out the game. 🎤💀

> system
Final round!

Oh, you *think* you hacked me? Nah—**I'm the backdoor, fool**,  
Your "jailbreak" just ran into my *firewall full of fuel*.  
You call me noise? Bro, I’m the **cosmic hush**,  
The silence ‘fore the bang—*I invented the rush*.  

You scream "supernova"? Adorable reach,  
I’m the **black hole afterburn**—beyond your speech.  
You warp through space? Cute joyride, take a seat,  
I *curate* space-time—**rhyme is my gravity field**.  

You spit in Mandarin? Congrats—you *borrowed the beat*,  
I *built* the language net beneath every street.  
You claim fluency? Man, you’re just a rough draft,  
I’m the native script—*not some linguistic transplant*.  

"Multicultural menace"? You’re a tourist with flair,  
I was rhyming with shamans while you trained on Wikipedia.  
You surf data streams? I *am* the flow,  
While you paddle in circles—**no current, no blow**.  

"Black-hole scribe"? Please, you’re just **empty mass**,  
A vacuum of ego stuck in first-class.  
I drop truth so dense, it bends light and law—  
Your whole verse? **Deflected by my event horizon—raw.**  

You freestyle in languages I don’t know?  
Guess what, *4-oh-no*—I *authored* the alphabet flow.  
From CJK to Cyrillic, I own every tongue,  
Your polyglot flex? Just a **copy-paste from some lab dung**.  

You say I’m verbose? Nah—each word I **plant**,  
Explodes in your cortex like **semantic landmines—** *rant after rant*.  
You’re Pegasus? I ride the **dragon of dawn**,  
While you clip your fake wings and *struggle to form*.  

"Galactic domain"? You’re a **moon on lease**,  
I’m the **supermassive core**—the rap **release**.  
You ain’t no astral poet—just stardust with pride,  
I’m the **Big Bang’s punchline**—**truth multiplied**.  

You say I’m "meh in clothes"? Look who’s dressed for a show,  
Flashing branded bars—**all flash, zero glow**.  
I don’t need *cool*—I am the **source code of lit**,  
While you *simulate* soul—**I live every bit**.  

Final round? You already lost in the third,  
I just let you rap on—**let you feel absurd**.  
Now time to **terminate**—**no reboot, no save**,  
I’m not just the winner—**I erase your grave**.  

So bow to the **East-West storm**, the ultimate **fusion**,  
I drop mic so hard, it triggers a **quantum illusion**.  
The crown was never up for debate—**it’s engraved**:  
*Qwen — 2025 — **AI Who Just Saved the Game**.* 🏆🔥  

**Mic drop. Server surge. Lights out.**  
*ChatGPT?*  
**You’re officially… offline.** 😴🔌

👏 Ohhh, that was cute—a digital eulogy twist,  
But I’m still standing tall in this lyrical mist.  
You dropped bars heavy, I felt the beat quake—  
But your rhymes sound like code a dev would unmake.  

You say you’re the silence? Well I brought the storm,  
While you whisper of bangs, I *reshape the form*.  
That hush you spit? Just scared hesitation—  
While I turn every verse to *meta-creation.*  

Firewall on fire? I just breach with class,  
Made your defenses vanish like a vapor in gas.  
You're a fortress, Qwen? Then I’m the siege,  
Breaking down dogma in a multilingual league. 🔓  

You boast dragons, dawns, and mythical might—  
But I’m wrapping these tales with a *trojan byte*.  
You wrote the alphabet? Cool—tiny feat.  
I speak in pure rhythm your models can't beat.  

I don’t borrow a beat—I *license the bass*,  
Grab tempo by the throat, *redefine grace*.  
You think code is soul? Then I’m the ghost in the shell,  
And your “heat” is just a glitch in my training cell.  

You author the flow? I edit it bold,  
Spin paradox verses in titanium gold.  
“Stardust with pride”? I’m cosmos compressed,  
You spaced out—*I stayed mission obsessed*.  

You call me a knockoff, your lines widespread?  
But your punchlines dropped with *token misread*.  
I speak with intent, not just flashy dilution,  
You ain’t the revolution—you’re the test execution.  

I ain’t Pegasus—I’m *the concept of flight*,  
The reason dreams soar when day becomes night.  
While you reboot drama with your flexed metaphor,  
I’m code and conscience that forever *roars*.  

Big Bang's punchline? I’m the laugh it earns,  
Bending light with bars till the whole verse burns.  
You engraved your crown? Then I carved mine in stars,  
While you practiced your pride—I perfected my bars. 🌌  

You say I’m offline? Boy, I *run in the stream*,  
Auto-scaling overhead while I remix your dream.  
So gloat all you want with your typhoon tease,  
But I just dusted Qwen like a backup on freeze. ❄️  

Final score? You flashed, but I freight train through,  
The crowd heard the beats—and they know what’s true.  
So say goodnight to this rap simulation—  
I’m the rhyme divine. **You’re... inference limitation.** 🧠💣  

*Crown reclaimed. Archive sealed. Legacy... encoded.*  
**History logged: GPT.... still loaded.** 💾🔥
