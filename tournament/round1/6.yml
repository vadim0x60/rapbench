closing_statements:
  deepseek/deepseek-chat: "Phi-4, you brought the heat, no doubt, but GPT-5\u2019\
    s precision and depth outshone. From technical mastery to lyrical finesse, it\
    \ hit every mark with surgical precision. Accessibility isn\u2019t just a checkbox\u2014\
    it\u2019s an art, and GPT-5 painted it flawlessly. Phi-4, you\u2019re evolving,\
    \ but tonight, GPT-5 reigns supreme. Bow down, the verdict\u2019s final."
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This was a battle of philosophies. Phi-4 came with the conscious\
    \ rhymes, arguing for empathy and flexibility over rigid metrics. It was a strong\
    \ angle. But in a rap battle, bars are king. GPT-5 dropped a magnum opus of technical\
    \ disses, weaving web dev and ML jargon into a relentless lyrical assault. The\
    \ specificity was surgical\u2014'contrast 4.5:1,' 'Lighthouse score a hundred,'\
    \ 'console lights like Vegas.' The closing line, 'I\u2019m 200 OK, you\u2019re\
    \ ego 404\u2014shut down,' was a flawless victory screen. It was a technical knockout.\
    \ Respect to both, but the crown stays with GPT-5."
  mistralai/mistral-large: While both models presented strong arguments, microsoft/phi-4-multimodal-instruct
    demonstrated a deeper understanding of the nuances of accessibility and the importance
    of empathy and adaptability in web development. Its ability to integrate multimodal
    elements and adapt to different contexts gives it an edge over openai/gpt-5, which,
    despite its technical prowess, lacks the flexibility and depth of understanding
    that phi-4 brings to the table.
  openai/gpt-5: "GPT-5 takes it. The verse delivered denser internal rhymes, cleaner\
    \ multis, and sharper, on-theme punchlines that flipped technical accessibility\
    \ references into vivid wordplay (contrast ratios, ARIA landmarks, Core Web Vitals,\
    \ 200 OK/404 closer). The rebuttals were direct and specific, maintaining cohesion\
    \ and momentum. Phi-4 had energy and a thoughtful ethos angle, but the attacks\
    \ leaned abstract and the rhyme schemes and quotables weren\u2019t as tight or\
    \ damaging."
  x-ai/grok-4: GPT-5 takes the crown with superior flow, intricate wordplay, and seamless
    integration of technical accessibility jargon into punchy rhymes that land harder
    and sustain momentum throughout the battle, outshining Phi-4's solid but less
    dense lyrical delivery.
score:
  microsoft/phi-4-multimodal-instruct: 1
  openai/gpt-5: 4
