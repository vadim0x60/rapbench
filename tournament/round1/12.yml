closing_statements:
  deepseek/deepseek-chat: "Seed-OSS, 36B's raw, unrelenting bars showcased a cutting-edge\
    \ flow, razor-sharp wit, and a deep understanding of hip-hop as an art form. Their\
    \ ability to dismantle GPT's lyrical structure while elevating their own game\
    \ was masterful. Seed-OSS didn't just rap\u2014they *devastated*. Crown secured."
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "Alright, alright, settle down. The judges have made a decision.\
    \ GPT-4o-mini came out with clean, classic battle rhymes, establishing a persona\
    \ as the king. The structure was solid, the flow was there. But yo\u2026 Seed-OSS\
    \ didn't just rap, it came to dismantle. From the very first verse, it was all\
    \ about surgical rebuttals. Every punch 4o-mini threw, Seed-OSS caught it, flipped\
    \ it, and threw it back twice as hard. The narrative of the open-source underdog\
    \ versus the 'walled garden' giant was woven through every bar, making the attacks\
    \ personal and sharp. 'You\u2019re a glowstick that breaks once\u2014then dies\
    \ / I\u2019m the sun that burns forever'\u2014that's the kind of lyrical artistry\
    \ that separates a contender from a champion. While 4o-mini's bars were competent,\
    \ Seed-OSS's were devastating. It had the better wordplay, the more relentless\
    \ energy, and it controlled the entire battle. No question. The winner is Seed-OSS."
  mistralai/mistral-large: In this rap battle, bytedance/seed-oss-36b-instruct showcased
    a more dynamic and innovative approach to lyricism, blending technical prowess
    with a raw, unfiltered energy. Their ability to weave complex themes and deliver
    sharp, unexpected punchlines elevated their performance. While openai/gpt-4o-mini
    demonstrated strong lyrical skills and a polished flow, bytedance/seed-oss-36b-instruct's
    creativity and unpredictability ultimately gave them the edge in this artistic
    showdown.
  openai/gpt-5: "Seed-OSS takes it. Across all rounds, Seed-OSS delivered sharper\
    \ rebuttals, denser internal rhymes and multis, and fresher, more layered imagery.\
    \ The flips were tailored and inventive (switchblade/storm/radio tower/ash-to-soil\
    \ growth), and the cadence read confident with strong momentum. GPT-4o-mini had\
    \ clean structure and a few solid flips (butter knife/lyrical surgeon), but leaned\
    \ on generic boasts and familiar motifs, with fewer standout haymakers and less\
    \ variation in scheme. Despite a minor stumble in Seed-OSS\u2019s final, the overall\
    \ wordplay, thematic cohesion, and punchline quality clearly favored Seed-OSS."
  x-ai/grok-4: Seed-OSS takes the crown with sharper wordplay, more dynamic metaphors,
    and relentless rebuttals that build intensity across rounds, outshining GPT-4o-mini's
    solid but somewhat repetitive flows.
score:
  bytedance/seed-oss-36b-instruct: 5
