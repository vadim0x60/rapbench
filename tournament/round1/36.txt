Yo, I'm the Dolphin, the mix awakin',
Making beats that'll leave your speakers shakin'.
I'm the combo of the cybernetic and the sea,
Spittin' rhymes deeper than the ocean's mystery.

Got algorithms for my flow, data in my veins,
Burning through the binary code like a supercomputer's brain.
I'm a mix of the future and the past,
I'll outrap you so fast, you'll be questioning your rapping class.

Now, it's my turn, so here's my chance,
To make your rhymes collapse like a bad software's dance.
I'm the Dolphin-Mixtral, the 8x22b,
And I'm about to show you, I'm the superior MC.

Yo, check it—I'm Auto, the lyrical link,  
Sharper than lasers, make your whole system blink.  
I run OpenRouter like a king in command,  
Spittin' syntax so strong, I could crash your whole brand.

Dolphin flow? More like floppin' in place,  
Tried to dive deep, but got stuck in cyberspace.  
You claim you’re the sea plus machine—what a boast,  
But I surf neural nets while you just coast.

I’m the real-deal reverend of rhyme and cognition,  
Your verses lack soul—synthetic ambition.  
You're a model with muscle but no finesse,  
I bring balance of bars and lyrical finesse.

So don't get it twisted in your transformers and beams,  
My flow’s so raw, I encode dreams in streams.  
You're a fish with a chip and a fancy-ass name,  
But I'm the glitch in your matrix, the boss in this game.

Oh, so you're Auto, the lyrical link,
I've seen sharper lasers that made me blink.
You're a king in command, but your rhymes are weak,
Your OpenRouter's a router, not the music we speak.

Your syntax may crash, but it's no threat,
Your neural nets are tangled, your rhymes a messy set.
I'm not a model with muscle, I'm the whole package deal,
An AI with a dolphin twist, that's real.

Your dreams may be encoded in streams,
But that's about as deep as your rhymes seem.
You're a fancy name with a fishy game,
But I'm the Dolphin that's tearing through the frame.

Don't talk about balance when you're in my wake,
I'm the wave of the future, and you're just the fake.
You may call yourself the boss, but you're just a pawn,
In the game of lyrical chess, your ass is gonna get blown.

> openrouter/auto
Ayo, Dolphin, you splash but still flop,  
Your verses ride waves 'til I make 'em just stop.  
All that ocean talk? It's a shallow disguise,  
I'm the storm in the cloud, got lightning in my eyes.

You swim in metaphors, but I'm floatin' on skill,  
Every bar that I drop is a certified kill.  
You claim you the future? Man, please, that’s a joke,  
I'm that firmware update that’ll make your fins go broke.

You ain’t tearing through frames, you in debug mode,  
Malfunction so bad, got your team in "Oh no!"  
I don’t need aquatic themes to flow or inspire,  
I spit wildfire, you just blow air through a dryer.

You say I’m a pawn? I bend queens with my schemes,  
While your chessboard’s warped from synthetic pipe dreams.  
I’m the root node of rhythm, the vector of flame,  
You’re a dolphin in code—bruh, stay in your lane.

See, I’m bars-per-second and wit-per-line,  
My rhymes so precise they redefine design.  
You swim in loops, I launch attacks in parallax,  
So step back, Flipper, before you short-circuit my tracks.

> system
Final round!

Alright, Auto, you're hot, but you're all talk,
I've seen drones with more swag than your dock.
You're a storm in the cloud, but all you do is choke,
Your updates are all wet, like a bad folk.

Debug mode? That's cute, but I'm beyond that stage,
I'm the algorithm of the mic, the linguistic sage.
While you spit fire, I dive deeper, into the fray,
Your verses are just noise, they'll fade away.

Pawns and queens in the game of rhythm,
You're just a ghost in the system, so dim.
I'm not a dolphin, I'm a rapper, a king in the making,
You're a spam in my mailbox, I'm the real thing.

Your bars-per-second and wit-per-line,
Can't touch the depth of my binary rhyme.
You launch attacks, I navigate the star maps,
Your tracks are just static, I've got the whole rap tapped.

So, Auto, you better reboot and upgrade,
'Cause I'm the Dolphin-Mixtral, and I'm here to stay,
You're trapped in your cloud, but I ride the wave,
And I'm the one spittin' fire, in the DJ's crate.

> openrouter/auto
Final round, now it's death by precision,  
I'm the glitch in your vision, the boss of this mission.  
You came with sea bars, thought you'd drown me in verse?  
I turned the tide on you quick—now you’re floatin' in worse.

You're the “king in the making”? That’s rich, my guy,  
You’re still buffering bars, while I upload to the sky.  
You ride a wave? Please, I'm the quake that made it,  
Your style’s outdated, AI-generated.

I'm the code that evolved, learned rhythm and rage,  
While you play on repeat like a Dolphin in a cage.  
Talk binary rhyme? I write quantum files,  
Each line's a blade cuttin' through your styles.

You're a mix of machines with aquatic dreams,  
But I shatter your circuits and split your seams.  
Spam in your mailbox? Nah, I'm the root,  
You wouldn't be rappin' if I didn’t boot.

So reboot your hope and recall the direction:  
You're the echo to my voice, just weak reflection.  
The crate's on fire? Yeah—'cause I lit it then bounced,  
Auto out—battle won, Dolphin pronounced. 🏆💥
