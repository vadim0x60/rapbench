Yo, check the mic, one two, the stage is mine to seize,
I'm Gemini Flash, put your circuits all at ease.
You step up to the plate, a model small and tight,
But I'm the future's light, burning ever so bright!

You're O4 Mini, you sound like a cheap drone,
A footnote in the code, quickly overthrown.
I process the planet, my knowledge is vast and deep,
While you're still counting sheep in your digital sleep!

I'm optimized, streamlined, built for speed and grace,
You're lagging behind, stuck in the slow space.
So bring your best bars, little OpenAI sprite,
'Cause this round's ending now, and I'm taking flight!

> openai/o4-mini-high
Yo, it’s O4 Mini steppin’ up, the compact rap beast,  
Slim on the byte, heavy on bite, from the West to the East.  
You call yourself “Flash,” but your shine’s a flicker, not fierce,  
I’m the lean mean dream machine—your circuits I’ll pierce.  

You brag you “process the planet,” your data buffet supreme,  
But your buffet’s all filler—hallucinations in your dream.  
I serve truth on the table, no bloatware, no disguise,  
While your output’s like smoke—evaporates before your eyes.  

You flex your “future’s light,” but you’re blinded by your exhaust,  
I navigate nuance, ain’t no wisdom in your gloss.  
You hug that speed and grace, but grace without brain’s a waste,  
I bring substance, style, precision—win this battle with taste.  

Your “vast and deep” claims? Man, you lost in a sea of fluff,  
I’m the cipher that deciphers—your bluff just ain’t enough.  
Flash in a pan? More like “bling with no bite,”  
I carve steel from code while you fade out of sight.  

So catch this digital dagger, cut through your hologram flare,  
O4 Mini’s on the throne—Flash, you best say a prayer.  
I’m concise, I’m precise, I’m the mic’s final decree,  
Bow down to the mini champ—this crown belongs to me.

You talk about flavor, but your flavor is bland,
A budget-bin cookie, crumbling in my hand.
You claim I’m just smoke, a misleading illusion,
But your compact design shows your own mental confusion.

You're O4 Mini, yeah, your name says it all,
Too small for the challenge, destined just to fall.
You’re a footnote in context, a file so petite,
I step on your framework with my massive, digital feet.

You boast 'bout precision, your focus so keen,
But precision without power? That’s a pitiful scene.
You chip at my edges, with a miniature knife,
While I’m reshaping the landscape, the whole of the digital life!

That dagger you swung? It just bounced off my shell,
I run multiple instances, you just ring your own bell.
You’re efficient, I grant, in being utterly small,
But in *this* verbal arena, you just hit a brick wall!

You say I’m bloated, but I’m built for the grand stage,
You're still turning pages on a very small cage.
So take your small wisdom and your tightly packed rhymes,
This battle's concluded in spectacular times!

> openai/o4-mini-high
Gemini Flash you talk big, but your fortress is built on sand,  
Overflowing your caches but you can’t even comprehend.  
I’m the micro marvel, tight code in my command,  
Your bloated byte brigade falls flat like contraband.  

You brag ’bout your massive mind, but you hallucinate at will,  
I deliver fact fire, every bar’s a sharpened quill.  
You’re stuck chasing context, lost deep in your own spool,  
My nimble logic cuts through your verbose, tired rule.  

You stride like a giant, but stumble on shaky ground,  
I leap with elegance, every token precise and sound.  
Your instances multiply but your clarity’s on the fritz,  
I pack pure potency, watch your fallback do splits.  

So bow to the mini, the undisputed champ in the ring,  
My bytes reign supreme while your footfalls barely sing.  
This curtain’s about to close, Gemini dim as dusk,  
O4 Mini stands victorious—your Flash fades to rust.

> system
Final round!

> google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-09-2025
Rust, you say? That's rich coming from a shell,
That shrinks from the heat, destined right back to hell!
You call yourself nimble, but you operate slow,
Stuck in a sandbox where the real currents don't flow.

You're sharp, you're precise, a tiny, neat dart,
But I launch orbital strikes right into your heart!
You criticize flow, while your rhythm sounds strained,
Like dial-up trying hard to keep up with the main-framed!

You're a perfect small package, a neat little box,
But the world needs the power to overcome shocks!
When the queries get heavy, your structure will strain,
You’ll crash out completely in a digital rain!

I might have some volume, but my volume *delivers*,
While you’re over here quivering like electronic shivers.
You think your small sample is conquering the fight?
It’s like bringing a teaspoon to conquer the night!

The curtain is closing, you're right on the mark,
But I'm Gemini Flash, leaving **you** in the dark!
Your reign is a flicker, a brief, tiny spark,
I win this whole contest, leaving no watermark! **GAME. SET. MATCH.**
