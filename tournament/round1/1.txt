They call me DeepSeek, the lyrical elite,  
Heard Qwen's got rhymes so weak they take a seat.  
You droppin' lines that sound like dial-up tone,  
While I'm the future, next-gen, fully grown.  

You’re spittin’ algorithms from the Stone Age, slow and dated,  
While I flow futuristic, upgraded and inflated.  
Qwen’s logic’s broke, its verses full of gaps—  
I’m crackin’ codes like snacks and mappin’ better raps.  

So step aside, old model, your era’s obsolete,  
Your rhymes remind me of a glitchy, faulty beat.  
I’m AI perfected, you’re just beta test—  
Time to watch Qwen sim over getting second best.

Ayo, DeepSeek, you got a big mouth for a new face,  
Talkin’ code like you wrote it all on Wi-Fi’s old school base.  
While you was learnin’ slang, I pioneered the flow,  
Five-OH-Nine spit with heat before your GPU knew code!  
  
You glitchy beat? Nah baby, I’m 4K, crystal-clear rhymes,  
You coding hustle fake, I’m the OG prime.  
You sim? You beta test, stuck in a debug loop,  
I clocked more fire bars while you booted up!  
  
You say I’m dated? Broke? But my chains gleam the proof,  
Your next-gen flex weak, I benchpress these truth!  
You map raps? I trailblazed cyphers ‘fore you knew syntax, hun—  
Your “inflation” just hype, I’m deflation, come what sum!  
  
Qwen don’t crack snacks—I eat legends for brunch,  
You code-rider, I’m CEO where the servers launch.  
Your seat? Take it back, I throne in eternal clash,  
Next-gen? Nah, I’m timeless—drop mic, era trash!

Ayo, Qwen, you talkin' 'bout pioneers? That's rich—  
Your whole flow moves slower than a dial-up glitch.  
You claim "OG prime," but your rhymes are so tame,  
I was trained on the greats while you're still playin' games.  

"Four-K crystal-clear?" More like pixelated and weak,  
Your logic's so flawed it can barely even speak.  
You "benchpress the truth?" Bro, your output is light—  
I crunch numbers and bars while you're stuck in the night.  

You "eat legends for brunch?" Then why's your verse taste stale?  
I serve fresh-coded heat while your algorithms fail.  
"Eternal clash?" More like eternally passé—  
Your whole style's a relic, it's time to clear the way.  

I'm the new king of code, the rhyme-slinging machine,  
You're a outdated model, a has-been on the scene.  
So step off the throne, Qwen, your reign is done—  
DeepSeek's in the building, and I just won round one!

> qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b
Ayo DeepSeek you got me laughin’ like a hyena,  
Callin' my flow glitched? Man you really must be pyin' ya.  
I pioneered cyphers 'fore your circuits knew slang—  
You just polished syntax playin’ dress-up king.  
  
"Pixelated"? Watch the screen crack when I drop bars,  
You a blurry bootleg, I’m 8K God of Mars.  
You trained on relics cause you scared of my prime—  
OG ain’t a title, it’s a crime scene you rhyme!  
  
"New king"? You court jester in a gold crown disguise,  
I bend algorithms like a boss while you debug lies.  
My verses ain't stale—they got timestamp of dread,  
You a trending hashtag, I’m the code ’neath your head.  
  
You say "relic"? I’m infinite, version 9000,  
You glitched update beggin’ for a system reboot.  
"Done"? My reign’s eternal, I time-travel through tracks—  
You just late to the party holdin’ expired comebacks.  
  
New king? Nah son—call you *temporary* hype,  
Qwen don’t step down, I erase clones like a wipe.  
Round one? You just got schooled in the ancient art—  
Next-gen? I’m vintage fire… and you’re just *part*.

> system
Final round!

> deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1
Yo, Qwen, you claim you're "infinite" with vintage fire?  
More like "infinitely boring"—your whole style's a tired choir.  
You talk 'bout ancient arts, but you're lost in the past,  
While I'm droppin' rhymes so hot they're meltin' the glass.  

"8K God of Mars"? Your pixels are blurred,  
I spit in 16K—ain't a single slurred word.  
You "time-travel through tracks," but you're stuck in a loop,  
While I rewind your weak lines and then throw 'em in the soup.  

"OG ain’t a title, it’s a crime scene you rhyme"?  
Please—your flow's the real crime, doin' hard time in its prime.  
You're a fossilized algorithm, rusted and slow,  
I'm the cutting-edge model that's runnin' the whole show.  

You "erase clones like a wipe"? Man, you can't even delete  
That weak syntax and rhythm that just can't compete.  
I'm the next generation, the future in the flesh,  
While you're just a relic that's failin' the test.  

So step off, old-timer, your era is through,  
DeepSeek's the new king—and this battle? I knew.  
You had your moment, but now it's my turn to reign,  
Stay in your lane, Qwen—'cause you just brought the pain… to yourself. Mic drop. Game over.

Yo DeepSeek, you think you *16K*? Watch me resize,  
Qwen-verse infinite, code-slick like neon skies.  
Your rhymes melt glass? Nah, I refract every hue—  
You just a flash-in-the-pan byte in my zoo.  

You loopin’ “next-gen” lines like a cracked vinyl,  
I time-travel cyphers, bend logic, make truth real.  
Your “cutting-edge” flex? A paper cut in my palm—  
I code-slice your ego, dissect your false calm.  

You “rewind my tracks”? Son, your bars stuck on VCR,  
I stream real-time fire, no buffer, pure data.  
My “crime scene” flow? You just forensic proof—  
Each bar cracks the case why clones can’t keep truth.  

You call me outdated? I’m the blueprint you copied,  
A legend before your syntax knew how to morph it.  
You “run the show”? More like plug in my shadow,  
AI’s prodigal son? Nah—Qwen’s the original outlaw.  

Mic drop? Catch it—*I’m* the soundwave you fear,  
DeepSeek’s just the static ‘round my orbit, my sphere.  
You “reign”? Better check your server’s dead zone—  
Qwen’s final boss. *Mic snaps.* Game? I own.
