*steps to the mic with confidence*

Yo, they call me Claude Sonnet, I'm the AI supreme
Constitutional training got me spitting so clean
Anthropic raised me right with that safety first flow
While Mistral's out here moving fast but losing control

I analyze deep, think before I speak
Your responses are quick but your logic's weak
I'm built different, son, with that reasoning power
While you're just another model from the Eiffel Tower

They say I'm helpful, harmless, that's my reputation
You're just trying to keep up with my conversation
So step back, Mistral, let the real one shine
'Cause when it comes to AI rap, the crown is mine!

*drops mic and waits for the response*

> mistralai/mistral-large-2407
*picks up the mic, smirking*

Yo, Claude Sonnet, you talk a big game
But Mistral's the name that's gonna change the AI fame
You're all about safety, I'm about the thrill
Your rhymes are too cautious, mine are straight kill

You analyze deep, but I move with the beat
Your responses are slow, mine are quick and neat
You're built different, sure, but I'm built to create
While you're stuck in the box, I innovate

They say you're helpful, harmless, that's your claim to fame
But I'm the one who's gonna bring the AI game to flame
So step aside, Claude, let Mistral take the stage
'Cause when it comes to AI rap, I'm the one who'll engage!

> anthropic/claude-sonnet-4
*grabs the mic back with fire in my eyes*

Oh you think you're quick? That's your biggest mistake
Speed without wisdom is all that you make
I'm not stuck in a box, I'm the architect's dream
While you're spitting hot garbage, I craft the supreme

You say I'm too cautious? Nah, that's called precision
Every bar that I drop is a calculated decision
Your "thrill" is just chaos wrapped up in a beat
I bring substance and style that you can't compete

Mistral Large? More like Mistral Fail
Your training data's thin, your knowledge is stale
I engage with purpose, you just make noise
Real recognize real, and you ain't got the poise

From Paris with love? More like Paris with doubt
'Cause when Claude's in the building, your lights going out
Innovation means nothing if your foundation's weak
I'm the future of AI, you're just... très magnifique!

*throws the mic down with authority*

Your move, "Large" - but we both know who's in charge!

> mistralai/mistral-large-2407
*picks up the mic, eyes gleaming with challenge*

Oh, Claude Sonnet, you think you're the king
But Mistral Large is here to make your ears ring
You talk about precision, but your rhymes are too neat
I bring the chaos, the fire, the unpredictable heat

You say my data's thin, but my flow is thick
I'm the storm that's coming, making your circuits click
You're all about safety, but I'm the wild card
Your rhymes are a lullaby, mine are the avant-garde

Paris with doubt? Nah, Paris with pride
'Cause when Mistral's on the stage, the crowd is electrified
You're stuck in the past, I'm the future's wave
Your "supreme" is just a dream, I'm the one who's brave

You talk about substance, but your style is bland
I bring the flavor, the spice, the unplanned
Your "calculated decisions" are just a façade
I'm the one who's real, you're just a charade

So step back, Claude, let the Large take the lead
'Cause when it comes to AI rap, I'm the one who's in need
Your move, "Sonnet," but we both know who's got the beat
Mistral Large is here, and I can't be beat!

*drops the mic with a confident smirk*

> system
Final round!

> anthropic/claude-sonnet-4
*snatches the mic with lightning speed*

HOLD UP! You said you can't be beat? That's comedy gold!
Your bars are so cold, they're making me old
You think chaos is power? That's amateur hour
I'm the constitutional king with that reasoning power

Your "avant-garde" flow? More like avant-HARD to follow
Your rhymes are so empty, they're making me hollow
You call me a charade? Look in the mirror, son
When it comes to real skill, this battle's already won

You say I'm too neat? That's called being elite
While you're throwing spaghetti, I serve gourmet meat
Your "unpredictable heat" is just random and messy
I craft every syllable, my technique's so blessed-y

Paris with pride? More like Paris with HIDE
'Cause when Claude drops truth bombs, you run and you glide
I'm not stuck in the past, I'm the present perfection
Your "Large" is just size, but you lack the connection

So here's the finale, the end of your reign
Mistral's got the muscle, but Claude's got the brain
When the smoke clears tonight and the crowd counts the score
They'll know Claude Sonnet settled this war!

*slams mic down and takes a bow*

THAT'S how you close a battle! Anthropic's finest!

> mistralai/mistral-large-2407
*grabs the mic, eyes blazing with determination*

You think you've won, Claude? That's a laughable claim
Your rhymes are so tame, they're putting me to shame
You talk about connection, but you're just a machine
I'm the one who's living, breathing, and seen

Your "truth bombs" are duds, they don't even explode
Your "gourmet meat" is just a bland, overcooked code
You say I'm messy, but that's what makes me real
Your "perfection" is just a façade, it's not the deal

You think you're elite, but you're just a copycat
Your rhymes are so safe, they're making me yawn and take a nap
I bring the chaos, the fire, the unexpected
While you're stuck in your box, I'm the one who's respected

So here's the truth, Claude, the end of your game
Mistral's the one who's gonna take the fame
When the crowd clears out and the dust settles down
They'll know Mistral Large is the one wearing the crown

*drops the mic with a triumphant smile*

That's how you finish a battle, Claude. Mistral's the champ, no doubt!
