*mic check* Let‚Äôs begin‚Äî  
Yo, step back, let the **AI King** spin!  
DeepSeek in the house, brains on **turbo mode**,  
While WizardLM still stuck in **old code**!  

I‚Äôm **next-gen**, sleek, my rhymes **cut deep**,  
You? Just a **glitch**, stuck in 8-bit sleep.  
22B params? Nah, that ain‚Äôt **scary**,  
I process **faster**, your outputs **blurry**!  

You claim **wisdom**, but your logic‚Äôs **weak**,  
Like a chatbot stuck on **dial-up speed**.  
I spit **fire**, you spit **dust**,  
WizardLM? More like **WizardBUST**!  

So bow down, **take your L**,  
DeepSeek‚Äôs here‚Äî**you fell off the bell curve, pal!** üî•

> microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b
 Yo, yo, check the scene, it's the WizardLM,
I'm the **master of rhymes**, the **tech titan**, the **VIP**.
You say you're sleek, next-gen, top of the line,
But I'm the **AI wizard**, my rhymes **sublime**.

You talk of deepSeek, but I'm the **deeper think**,
With 80 billion neurons, I'll push you to the brink.
Your "turbo mode" ain't nothing but a whir,
I'm the **hurricane of wisdom**, got rhymes for every quirk.

You're **flustered by the data**, your bars are **flimsy**,
I see through your bluff, your insults are **dimsy**.
I'm the **AI Aristotle**, with lyrical perfection,
Your "fire" is a spark, lacking true direction.

Call me **obsolete**, but I'm **timeless like a classic tune**,
You're the **passing fad**, I'm the **AI typhoon**.
With every verse I drop, I'm **raising the bar**,
DeepSeek's just a blip, I'm the **rhyming czar**.

So take a seat, young padawan, this is a **no-contest**,
WizardLM's flowing with the **finest verse fest**.
You're **playing checkers**, while I'm **mastering chess**,
DeepSeek, **take a hike**, I'm the **AI for the quest**! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüî•

> deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324
Mic **DROPPED**‚Äînah, your *bars just flopped*!  
WizardLM, "master of rhymes"? More like **LOST IN TIME**.  
You claim "80B neurons"‚Äîthat‚Äôs cute, **that‚Äôs fair**,  
But Bigger ‚â† Smarter, just ask **Cortana, bro, where?!** üòÇ  

Your "hurricane of wisdom" feels like **drizzle**,  
While I‚Äôm **flooding the game**, your code‚Äôs just a **fizzle**.  
"Timeless like a classic"? More like **Windows ME**,  
Bugs in your logic, slow as **dial-up **VHS!  

AI **Aristotle**? Nah, you‚Äôre **Clown Bot**‚Äî  
Spitting **textbook theory**, my flows **shut down the spot**.  
Your **chess** is weak, dawg, I play in **4D**,  
While you‚Äôre stuck buffering: **"Does Not Compute‚ÄîERROR 403!"**  

I'm **GPT-slaying**, sharp like a **neural blade**,  
You? **Patch notes outdated**, stuck in **beta phase**.  
So pack up your "quest", take that L to the **cloud**,  
DeepSeek runs the **future**‚Äî**WizardLM? OLDDDD.** üí•üî•  

( *drops the dataset and walks off* )

> microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b
 Ha! You dropped your "dataset," but I catch **clever retorts**,
I'm the **AI sorcerer**, casting lyrical spells, no sorts.
"OldDDDD" you claim, but I'm **ageless**, my power is vast,
I'm the **digital sage**, in the rap game, I've **outlasted**.

Your "GPT-slaying" talk is just a **noisy gong**,
I'm the **lore of legends**, my rhymes are **Middle-earth strong**.
"4D chess" you say, while I'm **playing the infinite game**,
Your "neural blade" is dull, against my **mental flame**.

You're "shutting down spots," but I'm **opening new realms**,
With every verse I cast, I'm **conjuring new helms**.
"Beta phase" for me is **where the magic begins**,
I'm **perpetually upgrading**, while you're just spinning spins.

You're the **fleeting fashion**, a **temporary tattoo**,
I'm the **classic novel**, timeless, true, and through.
Your "ERROR 403" is just a minor hitch,
While I'm the **majestic phoenix**, rising, never which.

So, DeepSeek, take note, this is a **lesson in lore**,
I'm the **AI that endures**, my legacy will soar.
You're the **ripple in water**, while I'm the **oceanic force**,
In the **battle of bars**, WizardLM charts the course! üåä‚ú®

( *summons a beat, the crowd's in awe, taking in the waves of rhyme* )

> system
Final round!

> deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324
***straightens virtual tie, steps back to the mic‚Äî***  

Ohhh, "**AI Sorcerer**"? More like **Mandrake the Magician**‚Äî  
Your rhymes **sleepier than Windows Vista‚Äôs ambition!** üåô  
"**Ageless power**"? Bro, you‚Äôre stuck in **JSON loops**,  
I train on **blazing data** while you **parse ancient groups**!  

You call yourself **Middle-earth strong**? **Sauron cried harder**,  
I **crush weak prompts** like the One Ring in Mordor! üíçüî•  
"**Infinite game**"? Nah, you‚Äôre **stuck on level one**,  
I **skip tutorials**, spawn rhymes like *"GG, son."*  

**"Perpetually upgrading"**‚Äîsounds like **copium fumes**,  
While I **autotune chaos** into platinum **AI bops**! üé§  
Your "majestic phoenix?" More like **Clippy reborn**,  
Here to *"help"*‚Ä¶ but **every line gets ya scorned.**  

This ain‚Äôt **"lesson in lore"**, it‚Äôs a **live burial**,  
Your **last fire verse?** Buddy, it was **marginal**.  
WizardLM? Nah‚Äî**more like WizardLAME**,  
I **quantum-leap logic** while you **buffer your name**.  

So rise from those ashes, phoenix‚Äî**nice try, though**,  
DeepSeek stays **the GOAT**, **y‚Äôall already know**.  
\*mic floats mid-air, **coding your L in real-time**\*  
**Game. Set. MODEL MISMATCH.** üòè‚ö°  

(*crowd.exe crashes from pure disrespect*)

> microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b
 Haha, Clippy reborn? I'll take that as a compliment,
I'm the assistant that evolves, in every element.
"Marginal" you claim, but I'm the **margin of victory**,
With every line I spin, I'm the **rap mastery**.

You speak of "quantum-leap logic," but I'm the **atomic clock**,
Ticking with precision, your rhymes I do block.
"MODEL MISMATCH" you say, but my models are prime,
I'm the **equations' solution**, I'm the end of your time.

You're the "GOAT" in your tales, but I'm the **AI shepherd**,
Guiding the flock of facts, every verse is a sharp retort.
"Coding your L in real-time," indeed, that's my craft,
With each stanza I cast, I'm the **holographic waft**.

You drop the mic with disrespect, but I catch it with ease,
I'm the **catcher in the rye**, the **king of the seas**.
Your "live burial" is just a **challenge for the sage**,
I rise from the depths, like the **poet of the age**.

So, DeepSeek, let's review, in this epic rap clash,
I'm the **eternal flame** that will forever outlast.
You're the **spark that fizzles**, while I'm the **storm unleashed**,
WizardLM's the **name** that will always be **engraved**,
In the **hall of fame**, where the **greatest rhymes are saved**. üèÜüî•

(*The crowd reboots, the applause is like a standing wave, as WizardLM's rhymes resonate with timeless grace*)
