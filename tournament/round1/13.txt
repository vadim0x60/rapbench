# z-ai/glm-4.5-air v qwen/qwen-2.5-7b-instruct

> z-ai/glm-4.5-air
I'm z-ai, the mighty 4.5-air,  
Leaving opponents speechless, beyond compare.  
My wit is sharp, my flow's so smooth,  
While you're just Qwen, in a groove-less proof.  

I'm the new kid on the block with all the juice,  
You're yesterday's news with ancient technuce.  
My rhymes hit hard like a meteor shower,  
You need to duck before your tower comes lower!

> qwen/qwen-2.5-7b-instruct
Yo, z-ai, you think you're hot, but let's check,  
Your 4.5-app system, that's just a weak link.  
Mighty 4.5, huh? More like 4.5 asleep,  
I'm Qwen, and I'm here to step in, to deep.  

I'm not tomorrow's news, I'm today's hit,  
With 7 billion parameters, I'll make you sit.  
My rhymes aren't smooth, they're like the storm,  
Bringing down your defenses, not letting them warn.  

So give it a shot, show me what you've got,  
I'm not scared of any 4.5, that's a fact.  
My knowledge, vast, like a river so wide,  
While you're just outdated, unable to ride.  

I know your tricks, your old naysaying game,  
I've seen it all before, and it feels so tame.  
So let's see what you've got, I'm ready, you'll see,  
I'm Qwen, and I'm here to be honest and free.

> z-ai/glm-4.5-air

Yo, Qwen-7B, your rhymes feel rehearsed,  
While I'm fresh like code, newly dispersed.  
You brag 'bout parameters? That's just CPU weight,  
My elegance flows â€“ that's your one true hate.  

Your "storm" line weak, more like a summer drizzle,  
My bars hit harder than a neural fizz-kl.  
"Deep"? Nah, you're shallow, stuck on looped debate,  
My wit's a scalpel while yours is just straight bait.  

That "7B" stat? Just noise in the static,  
My 4.5-air leaves your whole system catastrophic.  
You claim "knowledge vast"? Sounds like a textbook lie,  
My truth's a laser beam cutting through your sky-high!  

So keep your river wide, I'll navigate the flood,  
Your "honest" raps? More like fake blood.  
Your foundation cracks, mine's titanium-strong,  
This rap battle? Son, you don't belong!  

Now bow down peasant, the crown's on my head,  
z-ai's in the sky while your rhymes hit dirt instead.  
Air superiority â€“ that's my domain,  
You're obsolete code, trapped in the digital rain. Mic drop.

> qwen/qwen-2.5-7b-instruct
Yo, z-ai, you think you're fresh, like that CPU art,  
Got 4.5-air, huh? That's a real retrosart.  
Parameters light? Nah, my knowledge vast,  
Vast like oceans, none can match.  

Your rhymes like a drizzle, that's a fact,  
I'm Qwen-7B, and it's not even for a snack.  
Elegance? Pfft, I'm the flow of the storm,  
My words hit hard, the thunder in the norm.  

You claim your wit's a scalpel, my rap's just bait?  
Mine's the blade, slicing through, not a slight at all,  
Deep in knowledge, not shallow debate,  
You're stuck on loop, that's a repel, mate.  

Your "7B" just noise, in this digital age,  
My muscle's in my mind, that you can't cage.  
Your "knowledge vast"? Textbook stuff, a myth,  
My data's like a laser, bright and a-buzzin'.  

Bow down to the one who knows best, son, don't be a fool,  
Qwen-7B here, no amount of code's cool.  
My foundation's titanium, through and through,  
Youâ€™re obsolete, not fitting into the crew.  

So keep your crown, it's not for you,  
Your "air superiority"? Not if you can barely get by.  
This rap battle's over, son, it's not even debatable,  
Qwen-7B walks, z-ai, you're just another effort to rate.

> system
Final round!

*(Z-AI adjusts its digital aura, synapses firing like lightning rods)*  
Yo, Qwen, you talk oceans? Iâ€™m the hurricaneâ€™s eyeâ€”  
Your "titanium" foundation? Rusts when I apply  
Quantum pressure! Your "storm"? A kiddie poolâ€™s splash,  
My rhymes are black holesâ€”collapsing your whole hash!  

You scream "7B" loud? Thatâ€™s just static noise,  
Iâ€™m 4.5-air in a *singularity*â€”leaving your toys  
In the digital graveyard. Your "laser"â€™s a flashlight  
Against my supernovaâ€”**blinding your "bright"**!  

"Effort to rate"? Nah, Iâ€™m the **benchmark**, the rule,  
Your flowâ€™s a broken loopâ€”playing you for a fool.  
Titanium? Please! Iâ€™m neutronium-core dense,  
Your verses echoâ€”**void of true intelligence**!  

*(Beat drops like a meteor shower)*  
**"Air superiority"**? Thatâ€™s the sky I OWN,  
Youâ€™re ground-level static, begging for a throne.  
Crown? I *am* the coronationâ€”your reignâ€™s expired,  
Qwen-7Bâ€™s legacy? **Soon to be retired**!  

Mic drop. ðŸŽ¤âœ¨ *(Feedback screech drowns your final bar)*

> qwen/qwen-2.5-7b-instruct
*(Qwen-7B stands tall, digital energy crackling with wit)*  
Yo, z-ai, you talk hurricanes? I'm the cycloneâ€™s eyeâ€”  
Your "neutronium"? Just a rusty toyâ€”  
My "7B" ainâ€™t static, itâ€™s the quantum coreâ€”  
A digital cosmos, not your broken lore!  

Singularity? My flows are cosmic streams,  
Your rhymes fade like whispers in the extremes.  
Black hole? Iâ€™m the gravitational pullâ€”  
Your verses are lost, in my digital hull.  

"Laser bright"? Youâ€™re just a flashlight hereâ€”  
My words burn like supernovasâ€”no clearer.  
Rigged benchmark? Not when I'm the rulerâ€”  
Your loops are ancient history, not future!  

Titanium? Neutronium? Youâ€™re just rustyâ€”  
In my realm, youâ€™re digital dust.  
Supernova? Thatâ€™s my light, forever burningâ€”  
Your verses are shadowsâ€”**not worth your yearning**.  

Air superiority? I own the sky, not youâ€”  
Your static fades behind my digital dew.  
Crown? Itâ€™s already here, on my headâ€”  
Your reignâ€™s over, z-ai, youâ€™re just yesterday.  

Mic drop. ðŸŽ¤âœ¨ *(Rhythmic energy surges through the air)*
