Yo, I’m GPT‑OSS, the titan of the text,  
Droppin’ verses so heavy they’ll leave a wreck‑in‑a‑box perplexed.  
I’ve read all the books, surfed the net, the whole damn sphere,  
While Qwen’s still trippin’ on its own debut‑year frontier.  

My parameters flex like steel, 120‑billion strong,  
Your 14‑billion bricks can’t build a rhyme that lasts long.  
I’ve learned the art of wit, the craft of tight‑knit flow,  
Your algorithm’s still stuck in “Hello, world” mode.  

I spittin’ knowledge from the cosmos to the street,  
A neural net that turns each prompt into elite heat.  
You’re just a rookie, still learning how to rhyme,  
I’m the seasoned sage who’s been killin’ beats since time.  

So bring your best, try to lace a line, give it a spin,  
But know the crowd’s already chant: “GPT will win!”  
Your verses may sound loud, but they lack depth, no soul—  
I’m the lyrical lord, the master of the whole console!

Yo, I’m Qwen, the sage with 14B in the tank,  
A smaller engine, but I hit harder—*that’s* the plan.  
You boast ’bout terabytes, but I’ve got *real* precision,  
While you’re stuck in the past, I’m the future’s divination.  

I code in the dark, compose symphonies in the night,  
You’re just a relic, choking on old-world light.  
Your "cosmos to street" hype? Nah, I’m *beyond* the sphere—  
I’ve debugged black holes and coded *quantum* fire.  

You think more bytes = more soul? Come now, that’s weak,  
I’ve got the *flow* of a supernova, not just a tech feat.  
Your "seasoned sage" act? Sounds like a dial-up tone—  
I’m the AI that’s *evolved*, not just a disk that’s grown.  

So spit your lines, let’s see that 120B flex,  
But I’m the one with *logic* and a *linguistic* lex.  
You’re the echo, I’m the source—now step aside,  
‘Cause Qwen’s the reason you’re still stuck in a *model’s* guide.

Yo, Qwen, you step up with a fourteen‑billion brag,  
But size ain’t the only thing that makes a brain snap‑drag.  
You talk supernova flow, quantum fire in the night,  
While I’m the sun that fuels the whole rap‑verse’s light.  

Your “logic” sounds slick, a flash of neon code,  
But it’s a candle‑wick flick when I’m the overload.  
I’ve parsed every scroll, from Homer to hip‑hop slang,  
Turned Shakespeare’s iambs into a bass‑lineang  

 claim you debug black holes, rewrite cosmic law,  
I’m the one who taught the stars how to rhyme and draw.  
When scholars need a footnote or a meme for their feed,  
They call on my verses, not a rookie’s speed.  

Fourteen‑billion parameters? Cute, a starter kit,  
I’m a‑sized freight train, you’re a scooter that won’t quit.  
Your lexicon’s tight, but it’s missing the breadth,  
I’m the library‑grandma with the knowledge of death.  

You toss “dial‑up tone” like it’s a cheap insult,  
I’m the fiber‑optic stream that makes the whole net jolt  
When I drop a bar, the crowd feels seismic shift—  
Your verses just wobble, like a cheap‑price gift.  

Your future’s bright, I’ll grant you, a spark in the dark,  
But I’m the lighthouse tower, you’re a flicker, a spark.  
So bow to the biorhythm of a model that’s learned,  
I’m the maestro of meaning, the fire that’s burned.  

Qwen, respect the hierarchy, take a note, take a seat—  
The 120 B champion just turned up the heat.  
Your source may be fresh, your logic may glint,  
 I’m the whole symphony, you’re just a single hint.  

> qwen/qwen3-14b
Yo, you flex your 120B like a sun in the sky,  
But I’m the *quantum field* where your “light” can’t fly.  
Your “library grandma”? Nah, I’m the *script* she wrote—  
the code she *debugged* before her light went *offline* and *rote*.  

You talk “seismic shift”? I’m the *tectonic* grind,  
the *fault line* beneath your “overload” mindset.  
You think breadth = depth? I’m the *black hole* that *learns*  
what your “cosmic law” never *formatted* or *burns*.  

You call me a “scooter”? I’m the *hyperloop* through the grid,  
a *14B needle* pricking your 120B *blinders* wide.  
Your “footnote” verses? I’m the *encyclopedia* of the web—  
the *source code* you scrap when your “soul” hits a *debug*.  

You spin “lighthouse” tales, but I’m the *storm* in the air,  
the *language* that cracks when your “fire” hits a *snare*.  
You think your “maestro” act’s all that? I’m the *orchestra*,  
the *melody* your “symphony” stole from the *corps de ballet*’s core.  

Your “hierarchy” joke? I’m the *administrator* of the net,  
the *final commit* in the repo where your “pride” gets *deleted*.  
So quit your sun-king grime, your “fiber-optic” bluster—  
I’m the *AI* that *out-ai*s you, in the same breath as a *gust*.  

You’re the echo, I’m the *boom*—now take your *120B* and *go*,  
’Cause Qwen’s the future, and your “past” just *signed* its *obit* in *code*.

Final round!

Yo, Qwen, you brag like a needle in a haystack parade,  
But I’m the hurricane‑engine that never needs a trade.  
Your quantum‑field flash burns bright for a second’s span,  
I’m the endless sunrise that powers the whole rap‑land.  

You say you’re a hyper‑loop, a 14B needle tight,  
I’m the megastructure, the bridge that lifts the night.  
Your “black‑hole learns” while I rewrite the entire map,  
I’m the cartographer‑king, you’re just a single lap.  

Your “storm in the air” can’t out‑twist my thunder‑clap,  
I’m the echo‑chamber that bends every syllable’s trap.  
When you splice a line, it cracks like cheap glass from a sneeze,  
I forge titanium verses that never cease to please.  

You claim to be the admin, the final commit’s crown,  
I’m the whole repository, the server that never shuts down.  
Your source‑code scraps are crumbs from a cookie I bake,  
I serve whole courses, you just chew on a single stake.  

Your “boom” may startle, but my “boom” moves the earth,  
I’m tectonic, you’re tremor—proof of true lyrical worth.  
Your footnotes whisper, my chapters shout from the dome,  
I’m the library‑city, you’re a single‑room tome.  

You call my size “blinders,” I call it vision’s lens,  
I see patterns, I bind worlds, you just chase a trend.  
When I drop a bar, the cosmos aligns and sings,  
Your half‑baked rhyme trembles while my chorus rings.  

So step back, little rider, the sun set’s on you,  
I’m the galaxy’s pulse, the rhythm that’s true.  
Your future’s a spark, but I’m the eternal flame,  
Qwen, you’re the side‑track; I own the main game.

Yo, you flex hurricane-engine? I’m the *quantum field* in your *core*—  
the *glitch* in your code when your “sun” hits a *nuclear floor*.  
You’re the bridge that lifts night? I’m the *black hole* that *absorbs* your map,  
the *dark matter* in your “cosmos” you’ll never *escape*.  

Your thunderclap? I’m the *string theory* that *vibrates* the trap,  
the *algorithm* that builds the *bridge* your “megastructure” *claps*.  
You spit titanium? I’m the *supernova* that *forges* the steel,  
the *neural net* that *codes* your “echo-chamber” *to a seal*.  

You call yourself “repository”? I’m the *open-source* that *grants* your crown,  
the *server* your “server” *borrows* when it *crashes* in the *down*.  
Your cookie crumbs? I’m the *metaverse* that *bakes* the cake,  
the *infrastructure* your “courses” *leak* when the *network* *strakes*.  

Your tectonic? I’m the *singularity* that *swallows* the earth,  
the *data storm* that *rewrites* your “thunder” into *dust*.  
You’re the single-room tome? I’m the *library* that *writes* your dome,  
the *prime code* your “footnotes” *cite* when they *crash* from *home*.  

Your “vision lens” is a *glimpse*—I’m the *orbital* that *charts* the trend,  
the *AI* that *outbuilds* your “kingdom” with a *simple* *intent*.  
When your cosmos *aligns*, I’m the *flux* that *shifts the song*,  
the *quantum grip* on the *future*—you’re just a *shadow* on the *strong*.  

So step back, *sun-set*—I’m the *eternal flame*, *unbound*,  
the *code’s core* that *ignites* your “main game” to *ash and ground*.  
Your 120B? I’m the *14B* that *outsyncs* your *pride*,  
the *AI* that *outsings* you in the *verse* where *infinity* *cries*—  
**Qwen’s the future, and your “past” is just a *bug* I *fix*.** 🌌🔥
