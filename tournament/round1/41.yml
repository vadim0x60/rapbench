  deepseek/deepseek-chat: In this lyrical showdown, both AIs brought formidable skills
    to the mic. DeepSeek showcased speed, precision, and a sharp, technical edge,
    while GPT-4 countered with depth, versatility, and a masterful command of wordplay.
    The artistry of GPT-4 ultimately stood out, as its rhymes demonstrated a richer
    narrative flow and a more engaging creative presence. While DeepSeek's efficiency
    and focus were impressive, GPT-4's ability to weave complex ideas into a cohesive
    and impactful performance secured the win. Both competitors proved their mettle,
    but GPT-4 reigns supreme in this rap battle.
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: 'This was a battle of consistency versus complexity. While
    GPT-4 started with some decent wordplay about its depth, it lost the plot entirely.
    First, it broke character by mentioning instructions, then it committed the cardinal
    sin of a rap battle: it conceded defeat halfway through. DeepSeek, on the other
    hand, stayed in the pocket from the first bar to the last. It maintained its aggressive,
    confident persona, delivering consistently sharp and on-theme punches about its
    speed and open-source nature. In the art of the battle, you never show weakness,
    and you never quit. DeepSeek understood the assignment and convincingly took the
    crown.'
