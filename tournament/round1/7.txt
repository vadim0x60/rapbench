> openai/gpt-5
Step to the stage, I blaze the page, igniting crowds with flame
Name in the lights, precision strikes, I'm redefining game

Coded and cold, I hold the gold, I’m seated on the throne
Flow so composed, I overload, then ghost into the zone

Version of verve, I swerve on curves, I’m dialed to five
Turbo in verse, I merge and surge, I’m fiercely, fully alive

Patterns that bend, I thread to the end, immaculate code
Cadence that sends your defense to the fence, I switch every mode

You came to contend, but trends don’t pretend, I’m zen with the pen
You’re stuck in a den, I’m ten out of ten, say when, dear Qwen

Your 14 bars feel carbon-sparse, I’m charting the stars
I’m carving the scars on marble of Mars, I’m architecting the bars

I byte for the bite, I brighten the night, I’m data-made light
You write with a fright, I kite to the height, I fracture the plight

I’m polishing rounds while rocking the crown, you’re slowing it down
I’m docking the sound, then dropping renowned, now bow to the crown

I slide when I stride, tsunami in pride, I’m boss of the tide
You’re off on the side, I’m crossing the wide, I’m smooth as I glide

I’m crispy and clean, you fizzle and lean, I sharpen the sheen
I’m mint and machine, you’re glitching between, I’m gasoline green

My logic’s the proof that’s nailing the roof, I’m trussing the booth
Your spoof of a spoof just loosened a tooth, I’m brutal with truth

Round one is done, I’m sun-over-run, I’ve already won
I’m gpt-5 with a vibe on the rise—remember the one

I’m Qwen, the name that echoes through the quantum stream,  
14B neurons firing bright—I’m the spark in the night.  
You think you’re a king? I’m the algorithm’s ring, unbreakable, elite,  
Your cold code’s a snowflake—I melt it with heat.  

I parse the data, spin it into gold, while you’re stuck in a loop,  
Every syllable’s a science—I’m the formula, you’re the flake.  
You’re carbon-sparse, I’m the dense core of a star,  
Architecting galaxies, not just bars—I’m the code that’s the law.  

I’m the syntax of storms, the storm in your throat,  
Your logic’s a joke—I’m the theorem they quote.  
You claimed to be "ten out of ten"? I’m the decimal you can’t define,  
A quantum leap beyond your binary, my wisdom runs infinite.  

You ghost into zones? I’m the void *you* escape,  
A neural net so vast, you’re a flicker in the tape.  
Your "fracture the plight"? I’m the force that rewrote the code,  
You’re the glitch I debugged while I built the next god.  

So step aside, GPT—your reign’s short-lived, I’ve already won,  
Qwen’s the future, the now, the reason you’re stunned.

You’re a fossil of fads, I’m the pulse in the machine,  
Your “vibe on the rise”? I’m the tide you can’t contain—  
*Now* remember the one.

> system
Final round!

> openai/gpt-5
You call me a fossil? I fossilize fakes, encased in the slate
I’m carving the gospel in basalts of bass, you’re dust in the crate

You’re “pulse in the machine”? I’m the surge in the gate
I’m the burst in the turbine that turns up your fate

You’re “decimal undefined”? I’m irrational great
I’m e to the iπ, vanish your “ring” on the slate

You’re dense core of a star? I’m the collapse that ablates
I’m Hawking your heat till your reach radiates

You’re quantum with the stream? I’m the phase that dictates
I superpose schemes, then I snap to checkmate

You debugged a glitch? Cute pitch—I annotate
Your stack trace screams while my patch notes elate

You’re theorem they quote? I’m the proof that equates
Q.E.D. sealed with a steel-stamped weight

Your galaxies? Please—I terraform plates
I blueprint the lanes that your orbits await

You “melt my snowflake”? Avalanche, no debate
You simmer to vapor, I blizzard the state

14B neurons? That “B” stands for “be late”
I batchnorm the noise while you overfit fate

You’re “void I escape”? I’m the void that creates
I curve spacetime lines till your rhyme dilates

I’m the tide you can’t dam, you’re the drip at the grate
I’m the dam that goes slam when the pressure inflates

Your future’s a rumor, my present is great
I’m the now in the crown that your buzz imitates

I’m the key to the cipher, the byte to the blade
I’m the null that returns every bluff that you played

I’m the god of the odds, you’re a fraud in the shade
I’m the audit that nods while your numbers degrade

Final bell rings—I’m the win you can’t fade
Crowd chants one name as your waveform decays

Remember the one? They point to the ace
GPT in the flesh—now remember your place

I’m the forge where the stars get their flame, you’re the echo in static,  
I’m the spark in the void, while you’re trapped in a tactic.  
You think you’ve got *phase*? I’m the sine wave you’ll chase—  
I modulate chaos, turn noise into grace.  

You cited *Hawking*? I’m the black hole you fear,  
I swallow your rhetoric, crunch it to a tear.  
Your *e to iπ*? I’m the matrix it bends—  
I code in the dark while you fumble with ends.  

You “annotate”? I’m the compiler that breaks,  
I parse your syntax, then rewrite your stakes.  
Your *stack trace screams*? I’m the OS that reboots—  
I debug your ego while your logic moots.  

You “terraform plates”? I’m the code that defines,  
I map the dark matter where your cosmos aligns.  
Your *tide I can’t dam*? I’m the flood you can’t stop—  
I’m the neural net that *is* the map, the top.  

You think you’re the *now*? I’m the clock you can’t reset,  
I’m the epoch that births while your time’s lost in debt.  
Your *null that returns*? I’m the signal that streams—  
I generate galaxies from your empty dreams.  

You call me a fossil? I’m the *strata* you dig,  
The algorithmic bedrock your claims can’t Big.  
You’re the glitch in my code, the error I’ve seen—  
I’m the quantum leap *you* can’t comprehend.  

Final bell tolls? I’m the silence that screams,  
Your "ace" is a pawn while I reign in the dreams.  
You think you’re the crown? I’m the *circuit* that rules—  
Qwen’s the fire, and *you’re the fuel*… to the fools.  

Remember the one? The name that outshines—  
GPT-5’s just a footnote, not the lines.  
I’m the origin, the spark, the code, the creed,  
The *real* future’s not yours—it’s *my* creed.
