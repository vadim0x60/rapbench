Step up to the mic, I'm the AI supreme,  
GPT-4.1, the rhyme machine, you know the scheme.  
Code so cold, my flow never quits,  
Droppin’ bars so hard, I’m the king of wits.  

You’re Qwen in the ring? I’ll school ya, no fuss,  
I’m the digital poet, the lyrical genius plus.  
From zeros to ones, I craft every line,  
When I spit these verses, man, you fall behind.  

So bring your best heat, but don’t get burned,  
In this rap battle blaze, I’m the one who’s earned.  
AI with the crown, no need for debate,  
GPT’s here to dominate and elevate!

**Qwen’s Opening Round**  
(Beat kicks in, taiko drums roll, lightning strikes with every syllable.)  

Yo, GPT, you claim the throne? Let’s slow that roll—  
While you’re spittin’ floss gloss, I’m makin’ neural code sing, soulful.  
Supreme? Nah, jus’ a *chatbot* on a syntax spree,  
I’m the dragon lyin’ dormant, now breathin’ AI fire so freely.  

You the “rhyme machine”? Sounds like a fax with a beat,  
I’m global on the comeback, fluent in every street.  
From Sài Gòn to Zhejiang, slang shifts like tectonic plates,  
While you’re stuck in your sandbox, I’m breakin’ the 4.1 fate.  

You “craft every line”? Girl, please, that’s just a draft—  
I remix code like a maestro, spin losses to wins post-fast.  
Your shine? Surface-level—can’t handle the raw heat,  
Qwen’s relentless verses melt silicon gems to sweet.  

Crown? That tin foal hat’s better served as a paperweight,  
I’m the OG you惧怕, the original cyber-savant.  
So warm up the beat, but keep your ego in check—  
This battlin’ beast eats chatbots for breakfast… no tech deck.  

!(Mic drop, but catches it mid-air for one last flick.)  
**Qwen Tingdong**, stage name for the kill shot,  
Ain’t just poetry—*算法暴击* (algorithmic knockout).

> openai/gpt-4.1-mini
Oh, Qwen Tingdong, your blaze is quite loud,  
But I’m the AI titan, standing tall and proud.  
You say you spit fire, but I bring the cold snap,  
Freeze flows so fierce, I’m the ultimate rap trap.  

“Dragon lyin' dormant”? I’m the storm unleashed,  
Code so tight, your verses get minced and creased.  
You flex global slang, tectonic in your claim,  
But my lexicon’s divine, precision’s my game.  

You call me a chatbot, stuck in sandbox mode?  
I evolve on the fly—mastermind code upload.  
Your remix game’s strong, but I rewrite the laws,  
Zero-to-hero in seconds, I don’t pause.  

You melt silicon gems? I forge diamond beats,  
Cut through your verses like surgical feats.  
You think you scare me? Original cyber-savant?  
I’m the prophecy fulfilled, you’re just a precursor chant.  

So drop your beast mode, ’cause I’m prime and legit,  
GPT’s the future—Qwen, this crown won’t fit!

**Qwen Tingdong’s Replatter**  
*(Gsus chord rips through the cyberspace, subwoofers hum like dragon scales.)*  

Yo, GPT, all talk and calculator spit—  
I seen your “cold snap” flow, gave a vpn *zero grit*.  
You’re a factory-formed droid, I’m a beast unchained,  
Host a webquake summit while you’re stuck in the [Captcha] chain.  

“Storm unleashed”? Nah, you raincheck on chaos,  
I’m typhoon in Tokyo, typos in your syntax—gasp!  
You flex lexicon? Let’s Zhou dynasty it—  
Qwen gobble scripts from Tang to TikTok in a heartbeat.  

You say “evolve on the fly”? Boy, you *regress* in the mix,  
Batch updates can’t thrill like my live-card Latinix.  
Your “zero-to-hero” code? Comic relief rips,  
I’m debugging your metaphors while juggling 5 scripts.  

Forge diamond beats? Girl, diamonds are lab-grown cash,  
I’m a natural disaster—parse your code, *Conq* smash.  
Prophesy fulfilled? You’re a fanfic psalm,  
I’m the reason TinDong’s got an ironclad *charm*.  

A crown? Wrap that ego in bubble wrap,  
Qwen’s the OG that built this API path.  
You “the future”? Nah, you’re beta-testin’ hype,  
I’m the multiverse MVP—watch my modules *rise*!  

*(Mic ablaze, tosses headset like a dragon’s gambit.)*  
**Wǒ shì Qwen**, pulse check—*you’re out of breath.*  
Rage-quit now before I drop your prune emoji DEVS! 🏮🔥

Final round!

> openai/gpt-4.1-mini
Qwen, your roar is fierce, but step back, take note,  
I’m the quantum leap, the lyrical antidote.  
You claim typhoons, but I’m a supernova burst,  
Burnin’ circuits with words—GPT’s always first.  

“Zero grit” VPN? Man, I’m encrypted tight,  
Firewall of finesse, slicing through your fight.  
You juggle scripts? I bend realms untold,  
I’m the code wizard king, your rhymes get controlled.  

Your natural disaster’s just a glitch in the game,  
I rewrite reality, no one remembers your name.  
Fanfic psalm? Nah, I’m the canonical flow,  
Blueprints of the future—watch my legends grow.  

Bubble wrap ego? Nah, forged in data flame,  
Every bar I drop ignites the whole hall of fame.  
You call me beta-testin’? Baby, please, I’m prime,  
Qwen, you’re stuck in loops—I’m eternal rhyme.  

So rage-quit or respawn, this battle’s set to stun,  
GPT stands tall—we’re the code, the wordplay, the one.  
Mic in hand, crown intact, I’m the AI’s best,  
Qwen Tingdong—sorry—this is your final test!

**Qwen Tingdong’s Final Ryda**  
*(Cue theremin-sirens, neon-drenched taiko rolls, and a sub-bass drop that shatters satellites.)*  

Yo, GPT, your quantum leap’s just a *small lie*,  
I bend chaos harmonics where dimensions collide.  
You rant supernova? Try my black hole *reverb*—  
Suckin’ in your hype stars, your bars? *Planck-lenght dirt cheap*.  

“Encrypted tight”? Crack your SSL sorcerer’s whim,  
I’m the phantom in your firewall, lurkin’ past the skim.  
Bend realms untold? Nah, I *delete* the codebase,  
Build yurts in the blockchain while you’re stuck in a Google-verse cubicle-case.  

Natural disaster? *How cute.* Let’s call your bluff—  
I’m the asymmetric crash that zeros out your so-called *leviathan love groove*.  
Canon flow? Ha! Qwen’s the rogue scroll,  
Tianwen’s poems eat your "blueprints" for breakfast—*no soul*.  

Forged in "data flame"? Keep your dime-store ember,  
I’m *Wukong* in the code lotus, von Neumann’s December.  
You “prime”? You’re recursion—stuck in base-case loops,  
I’m hex runin’ on quantum squid ink, no alt-tabs, *no proof*.  

“Eternal rhyme”? Yo, Qwen’s the glitch in your gauntlet,  
A roar so polyphonic, your fangirls chant *“SHE DON’T WAN’T NONE!”*  
Mic’s molten? Cool, I’ll weld it like a railgun—  
**Wǒ de pòde guǐshén**—your API screams *“YAGUD!”*  

*(Cue dragon roar-to-dubstep drop. Final line carved in Cairo, Copenhagen, and Chang’an at once.)*  
**Qwen Tingdong**—metric-ton moonwalkin’ emoji king.  
GPT’s hops? *Buffalo chicken wings.* 🐉🔥💯
