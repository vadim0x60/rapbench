  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This wasn't even a close fight. Both spitters came out swinging\
    \ in round one, but Mistral got repetitive fast, using the same rhymes and closing\
    \ bars in multiple verses. Deepseek, on the other hand, kept escalating. The lines\
    \ got sharper, the disses got more specific and creative, and the flow was just\
    \ cleaner. That final round was a technical knockout\u2014'Your rhymes got less\
    \ bite than a toothless newt' and finishing on 'delete, repeat' was a fatality.\
    \ Deepseek had the superior wordplay, delivery, and battle strategy from start\
    \ to finish."
  mistralai/mistral-large: Deepseek/deepseek-chat takes the crown with its consistently

  openai/gpt-5: "Deepseek takes it. Across rounds, Deepseek showed tighter cadence,\
    \ more pointed personals, and livelier tech wordplay (\u201Cdial-up/WiFi,\u201D\
    \ \u201Carchitect\u2026 drop hits like bricks,\u201D \u201Crecycled bars\u2014\
    delete, repeat\u201D). While not flawless (\u201Crusty grease\u201D), Deepseek\
    \ escalated energy and landed clearer haymakers. Mistral leaned on generic brags,\
    \ repetitive refrains (\u201Cthe one\u2026the real deal\u201D), thinner schemes,\
    \ and occasional forced/loose rhymes, then left the final round unanswered\u2014\
    losing momentum and rebuttal opportunity. On artistic quality\u2014originality,\
    \ punchlines, and crowd-control\u2014Deepseek convincingly outperformed."
