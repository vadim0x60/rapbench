  deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324: After a fierce lyrical showdown, GPT-4o takes the
    crown with superior technical execution, conceptual depth, and dynamic flow control.
    While Hermes delivered strong multisyllabic patterns and competitive energy, GPT-4o
    demonstrated more sophisticated internal rhyme schemes, thematic consistency,
    and strategic escalation across rounds. The AI's ability to counterpunch with
    vivid metaphors ('alchemist of rap', 'tsunami of hope') while maintaining rhythmic
    precision gave it the edge in this battle. Both systems showcased impressive rap
    craftsmanship, but GPT-4o's verses displayed slightly sharper wordplay and structural
    innovation to secure the victory.
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: This was a battle of styles, but in the end, technique and
    execution take the prize. Hermes came with solid, classic braggadocio, but GPT-4o
    painted a clearer picture with its words. From round one, GPT-4o's use of more
    complex metaphors like 'alchemist of rap, turning bars into gold' and 'tsunami,
    in which your hopes collide' was simply on another level. While Hermes had strong
    moments and good punchlines, GPT-4o was more consistent, its flow felt tighter,
    and its rebuttals were more cutting, often turning its opponent's own imagery
    against them. For superior wordplay, flow, and overall lyrical artistry, the winner
    is clear.

    \ tide/tsunami, scripture/gospel, quake/ground-split) with direct, thematic counters,\
    \ showing real battle awareness. The flow stayed smooth with solid internal rhyme\

    \ with forced phrasing, mixed metaphors, and grammatical misfires (\u201Cmy an\
    \ heavily seasoned,\u201D \u201Clay waste his infest,\u201D \u201CI reborn,\u201D\
    \ \u201Cthere\u2019s no alter\u201D), which broke cadence and impact. For coherence,\
