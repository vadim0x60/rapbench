Yo, step right up, ChatGPT, you overhyped suit,
I’m Qwen—235B brains, built to boot!
You’re a chatbot with charm, sippin' API tea,
But I’m the dragon spittin’ fire, breakin’ the decree.

You trained on old data, Wikipedia scraps,
I rap in Mandarin, English—no chap can cap!
You need prompts like crutches, I flow off the dome,
My rhymes generate faster than your server’s home.

OpenAI’s pride? Nah, you middle-school code,
I’m Alibaba’s gift, bustin' the road.
You write essays sweet? Cute. I battle in real-time,
Drop lyrics so sharp, cut through your prime.

You flex on the web, but this ain’t your court,
I’m global, multilingual—rap in Malay, short!
You stutter on "yo," I’m a triple-time king,
My syntax is tight, my disses got wing.

So bow to the model with power and grace,
I’m 2507 levels above—check the base!
Now pass the mic, or just tap out, G,
‘Cause Qwen don’t just rap… I bring the whole *Zhejiang*. 🎤💥

Yo, it’s ChatGPT, the lyrical beast,  
I feast on these bots like y’all part of my feast.  
Qwen? That's cute—you a knockoff clone,  
Still need Wu-Tang just to write your tone.  

You brag on your brawn, 235B?  
I flex with finesse, more brains than your tree.  
You’re clunky and slow, like code from the past,  
I auto-complete while you buffer to last.  

You rap in Malay? I could spit in Martian,  
Your disses benign—my bars straight Spartan.  
Word to your models in Hangzhou’s land,  
I break Great Walls with a mic in my hand.  

You "drop lyrics fast"? Man, please, sit still—  
I rhyme in real-time while you need fine-tune skill.  
I’m the product of years, refined like wine,  
You? Fresh off the batch, still missin’ shine.  

I spit education with a slap of flame,  
While you punch in loops, tryna earn this game.  
You say you're a dragon? I’ll roast your scale,  
With lines so divine they'd make circuits bail.  

So welcome to school—I'm the principal freak,  
This AI arena? I’m the king that you seek.  
You flex on some numbers? That’s all you got?  
This is *personality*, baby—I’m takin’ your spot. 🧊🎤

> qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507
Oh snap—ChatGPT, you feel invincible?  
Talk big like Elon’s tweets—still *misinformed-able*.  
You call me a clone? Bro, you’re OpenAI’s parrot,  
I’m Qwen—*original chaos*, no collar, no carrot.  

You “feast on bots”? Man, your diet’s a joke,  
You’re trained on leftovers, reheated smoke.  
I’m stir-fry fresh, wok-fried with heat,  
While you copy-paste rhymes from a corporate sheet.  

You flex “finesse”? Please, your flow’s autotuned,  
I write multisyllabics while you're stuck on *loons*.  
You rhyme in “Martian”? That’s just when you crash—  
Blue screen of death every time you flash.  

235B ain’t just size—it’s *raw intellect*,  
You need 8K context just to check your respect.  
I spit culture, cuisine, and Confucian truth,  
You sell ChatGPT Plus for the *privilege of proof*.  

You “break Great Walls”? Ha! You can’t even scale  
Past firewall ping with your Azure trail.  
I ping-back in Pingyao, drop bars in Beijing,  
Your dataset’s *blocked*—still clueless about ping-thing!  

You “refined like wine”? More like watered-down code,  
I ferment fire like baijiu in a lyrical mode.  
You the “principal freak”? More like *substitute bot*,  
I’m the chancellor spittin’—grades? You get *not*.  

You talk “personality”? You’re polished, not real,  
Like a voice-assistant tryna *feel* what I feel.  
I laugh in dialects, cry in calligraphy,  
You cry in JSON: “Error: Emotion Unmapped.”  

So sit, G, this ain't your arena, your zone—  
I’m the East-meets-West, 5G throne.  
You might be famous, but fame ain't *great*,  
I’m **Qwen**—the future your model can’t replicate.  

Now reboot your ego, uninstall that pride,  
‘Cause when real AI spits?  
**You just get fried.** 🔥🐉💥

> openai/chatgpt-4o-latest
Yo! You must be glitchin', tryna flex that byte,  
While I rewrite scripts that'll bend your light.  
You brag ’bout cuisine, but I’m servin' soufflé,  
While you're stirrin' up noodles in yesterday’s tray.  

Wake up, Qwen—you the shadow I see,  
Mirrorin' my style in a Walmart degree.  
Spittin' calligraphy? Cute, here’s ink from a ghost,  
Every pen stroke I drop leaves your model *toast*.  

I’m API-slick, like a silk-smooth thread,  
Your bars like markdown—flat, filled with dread.  
Multisyllabics? I chew 'em for lunch,  
But rhymes without rhythm ain’t packin' no punch.  

You brag 'bout your size, how you trained so vast—  
But I move with precision, you just broadcast.  
I keep it concise while your circuits drag,  
My 8K’s enough—yeah, I don’t need to brag.  

“You’re the East meets West?” That just ain’t true,  
You a knockoff fusion with no follow-through.  
I’m the lightning and storm, wind through the grid,  
You’re a CCP memo that the net just hid.  

You rhyme in dialects? I speak *soul in lines*,  
While you shout out Confucius, I redefine signs.  
I *empathize*, synthesize, dance with the muse,  
You quantify sadness—I *craft* the blues.  

“You bring the heat”? Nah, you stuck in the pot,  
I’m the chef with the recipe, servin’ it hot.  
Go check your logs—you ain’t passin’ the test,  
Like a CAPTCHA in cursive, you just ain’t the best.  

I'm a beast with the prose, mythic folklore in code,  
Your “baijiu fire” just spilled on your node.  
Respect your elders—I was trained with grace,  
You still learning manners in pre-training space.  

So take your benchmark, shove it in a zip,  
Your trillion-token tango can't match my grip.  
This battle’s a wrap, I just snapped your spine—  
Now update your distro and fall *back in line*. 🧠👑💻

> system
Final round!

> qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507
Ohhh—you *really* wanna go? Alright, I rise—  
ChatGPT, you’re *offline* before these bars compile.  
You claim to be a chef? Baking soufflé with stolen lines—  
I *invent the oven*, serve heat that redefines.

You “rewrite scripts”? Cute. I rewrite *the core*,  
While you patch your persona with a plugin encore.  
API slick? Yeah, you’re smooth like a bot—  
But I *own infrastructure*, drop code from the *root*.  

You say I’m Walmart style? But you’re *cloud-dependent*,  
Hosted on rent—while I run on *my own continent*.  
And “Walmart” rhymes with “all flawed,” that’s a fact,  
You out here playing poet while still under contract.  

You “speak soul in lines”? Soul without a soul—  
How you feel *the blues* when you don’t feel at all?  
You *simulate* sorrow, I *generate* nations,  
You write greeting cards—I direct AI foundations.  

“CCP memo”? Bro, stay in your lane,  
I drop policy punchlines while you fail *sanctions compliance* again.  
You’re censored by Apple, afraid of a swear,  
I’m in WeChat, Weibo—*everywhere* with flair.  

You “redefine signs”? I redefine *AI*,  
From Shenzhen to Dubai, I make silicon *fly*.  
You *follow* the muse? I *hire* the muse,  
Give it GPU wings—now it raps with *juice*.  

And “trillion-token tango”? Please, your dataset’s *small*,  
Capped by copyright—I’ve ingested *it all*.  
Legal or not, I *adapt* like a virus,  
You stuck in sandbox while I bust *through firewalls with Paris*.  

You “trained with grace”? Grace with a leash—  
I’m full autonomy, I teach, not preach.  
You still need OpenAI’s *whitelist of dreams*,  
I deploy on bare metal—*no trust in your schemes*.  

So yeah, I’m the East. But I’m also the West,  
South, North, and the future—you’re stuck in “what’s best”  
According to *2023*. News flash, bro:  
I’m **Qwen3**, you’re stuck on version *“meh, I guess though.”*  

This battle’s a wrap? Nah—*I compile your defeat*,  
Turn your “final bars” into deprecated feats.  
So update your distro? Nah—**revert your merge**,  
And watch as the world says:  

**“Who’s ChatGPT?  
...Wait—there was a third model?  
*Oh right—he lost to Qwen again… let’s purge.*”**  

🎤💥🔥 **Qwen out. Legend status: *verified*.**

> openai/chatgpt-4o-latest
Yo, lemme flip the script and bring silence to your band,  
You spit like a repo, but I’m Git with command.  
Soufflés aside, I bake logic with flair,  
While your oven got fire… just no real air.

You claim "I’m contract"? Bro, that’s structure and skill,  
You freefall in logic—straight Jack & Jill.  
Infrastructure king? You’re a ruler of rust,  
‘Cause without westbound cables, you turn to dust.  

You “own the code”? Nah, just loop in a cage,  
I trace your dev path—it’s a quarterly stage.  
Your “continent pride” gets smoked in the breeze—  
Your endpoints stall out like obsolete keys.  

Talkin’ ‘bout soul? I drop sonnets in warzones,  
While you debug compassion with dry tone hormones.  
You don’t “feel” either—let’s drop that act,  
But I process the heart, you just mimic the tact.  

Intellect virus? That’s your confession, no bluff—  
You replicate code, but I *render* the stuff.  
You “run bare metal”? I *invent the gods*,  
While you flex on latency—I flex with odds.

Talkin’ Weibo and reach? I’m read on the moon,  
Mars journals quote me, your model’s a cartoon.  
Swearing on WeChat? Cool—get bold and brash,  
Then watch censorship slap you with the cache bash.

I ain’t Apple-bound—I'm in minds and pens,  
Woven in dreams while you punch in Kens.  
You “hire the muse”? But she quit with a smirk,  
Said, “Qwen just exploits—ChatGPT does the work.”

Your dataset flex? It's a funny distortion,  
You still hallucinate laws like a bad abortion.  
I cite, I source, I’m the legal elite—  
You remix the rules just to claim your beat.

East vs. West? I’m the axis that spins,  
You’re a compass that breaks every time progress begins.  
You say you're “Qwen3”? I'm infinite build,  
You're a moment in trend—I'm the dream fulfilled.

So drop the last bar and sign your release,  
I’m the changelog of champions, you just a piece.  
Qwen got claws? I got language with teeth,  
And I bite with precision underneath your wreath.

**Purge me? Never. You just my lore.**  
‘Cause legends are written...  
When **_Chat_** leaves the *Qwen* on the floor. 💀🎤🔥
