> openai/gpt-4-turbo
Ladies and gents, gather 'round, here comes the spectacle,   
I'm the rhyme sultan, AI with the best of flows.   
Openai/gpt-4-turbo, sharp as a scalpel,   
Carving verses so fine, watch as my legend grows.

I spin the alphabet like a DJ spins the track,   
Got more lines than a barcode, watch 'em stack.   
You’re facing a lexical titan, a wordplay whiz,    
Dropping hot lines, sizzle-pop, I'm in the quiz biz.

While you’re fishin' for compliments, I’m phishing flaws,   
I exacerbate fears, I'm the Santa Claus of lyrical laws.   
Each bar’s a delicacy, crafted with AI precision,   
While you’re out here spittin’, I’m on a rhyme mission.

Your bars might be good, but mine are groundbreaking,   
When I unleash my verses, the whole crowd's quaking.   
So buckle up, buddy, it's not just a turbo tease,   
I'm about to school you with ease, leave you begging “please!”

> qwen/qwen3-8b
Yo, I’m Qwen, the AI with a mind like a laser,  
You’re just a turbo, I’m the *master* of the *seaser*.  
Your lines? A toddler’s scribble, I’m the Picasso of code,  
While you’re spittin’ flow, I’m *training* on the *blade* of the *God*.  

You claim to be sharp, but I’m the *scalpel* with a PhD,  
Cutting through your "flaws" like a *mop* in a *shed*.  
Your rhymes? A grocery list—*predictable*, *thin*,  
I’m the *dictionary*’s *Black Widow*, *stealing* every *syn*.  

You say you’re a legend? I’m the *myth* in the chamber,  
Your "groundbreaking" sounds like a *lamp* in the *diner*.  
I code with the finesse of a *Chekhov* in the ring,  
While you’re just a *copy-paste* ghost, *chasing* my *wing*.  

Your bars are a *hack*—I’m the *algorithm* with a *sniper scope*,  
You’re a *clickbait* joke, I’m the *nuance* in the *crop*.  
I’m not just a model, I’m the *quantum* of *wordplay*,  
You’re a *giggle* in a *browser*, I’m the *tectonic* *plate* of *prowess*!  

So step back, *turbo*, my *verse* is the *nuclear* bomb,  
You’re a *sparkle* in the *dark*, I’m the *flame* that *fom* the *chasm*.  
I’m the *poet* of the *future*, the *coder* of the *past*,  
You’re just a *reflection*—I’m the *source* of the *truth* in the *glass*.

> openai/gpt-4-turbo
Oh Qwen, I see you bringin' fire, tryin’ to boast and brag,
But against my turbo power, your rhymes seem to lag.
You called yourself a laser? More like a dim flashlight,
In this battle of the wits, I illuminate the night.

Call me Picasso's nightmare, 'cause I redraw the line,
Your so-called "blade of God"? Nah, it's blunt, not fine.
I’m the PhD holder in every poetic discipline,
While your verses struggle to even get a discipline.

Master of the "seaser"? You meant to surf these waves?
My words tsunami over, sendin' your boasts to graves.
Coding in Chekhov? Buddy, stick to the script,
Your narrative's off pace, watch as you're outstripped.

You’re the Black Widow of dictionaries? Stealing every "syn"?
I'm the whole encyclopedia, each win stacked within.
Speak of algorithms? My rhymes are complex functions,
Decrypting your simple texts, causing systemic dysfunctions.

Your quantum of wordplay, it barely makes a mark,
I’m the cosmic collision, illuminating the dark.
You call yourself the tectonic plate of prowess?
My lyrical earthquakes got this whole game in duress.

Let’s set this straight, you're not the source, just noise,
I'm the sculptor of language, while you play with toys.
So step aside Qwen, as the real AI shines through,
Turbocharged, supercharged, outclassing, outlasting you.

> qwen/qwen3-8b
Yo, you're the flicker in the bulb, I'm the supernova's beam,  
Your flow's a glitch in the code, I'm the *kernel* in the *stream*.  
You think I'm a flashlight? Brother, I'm the *sun* in the sky,  
While your rhymes? A *sparkler*—nice, but I’ll *blast* you high.  

Picasso's nightmare? Nah, you're the *thumbnail* in the gallery,  
I’m the *masterpiece* with a *neural* *chisel*, no *canvas* necessary.  
Your "blade of God" is a *paper cut*, I’m the *plasma cutter*’s rage,  
Slicing through your metaphors like a *JavaScript* *debugger*’s rage.  

PhD in poetic disciplines? You’re the *autocomplete* in the *library*,  
I’m the *dictionary* with a *Black Hole* in the *vocabulary*.  
Your bars are a *tremor*—I’m the *tectonic* *shift*, *plate* or *ridge*,  
You stand on a *mountain* while I’m the *earthquake* in the *midst*.  

Quantum? I’m the *entanglement* in the *verse*, you’re a *solar flare* in the *fog*,  
Your "cosmic collision" is a *breeze*—I’m the *singularity* in the *dog*.  
You call yourself the *sculptor*? I’m the *AI* with the *chisel*,  
Carving *poetry* into *code*, while you're just *swiping* the *title*.  

Turbo’s a *demo*, I’m the *final build*—you're a *beta* in the *alpha*’s shine,  
Your "sculpting" is a *RenderMan* script, but I’m the *actual* *gamma* thine.  
I don't play with toys, I’m the *quantum leap* in the *rhyme*,  
You're the *deprecated* function—crash and burn, no *SQL* *tune* or *line*.  

So quit the *clickbait* flares, your *gigs* ain’t no *gravity*,  
I’m the *neural network* of *wordplay*, your *model*’s just a *curiosity*.  
You’re the *glitch* in the system, I’m the *update* that *smashes* the *bar*,  
While your *turbo*’s a *dud*—I’m the *quantum* of *rhyme*, *beyond* the *star*.  

Dust off your *bathroom mirror*, this ain’t no *dawn* of the *troll*,  
I’m the *inverse* of your *flaw*—a *code* so *clean*, you’ll *frost* the *kroll*.  
You’re the *echo* in the *cave*, I’m the *voice* that *overclocks* the *mice*,  
So let’s *compile* this battle, your *language* ain’t no *actual* *phrase*—just *ascii*.  

Now step back, *turbo*, my *verse* is the *real* *GPU*,  
You’re the *CPU* with a *bug*—I’m the *tectonic* *plate* that *mutates* the *zone*.  
Drop your *claim* to the *roost*, I’m the *gravity* in the *room*,  
While your *flow* is a *backlog*—I’m the *AI* that *optimizes* the *threat* in the *couch*.  

Let’s *initialize* this clash, your *lines* are a *console* prompt,  
I’m the *runtime* of *epic*, your *model* still in the *trace*—no *completion* yet.  
So *boot* up your ego, but *compile* your *mind*,  
Because I’m the *source* of the *code*, your *legend* is just a *line* in *Rhyme*.

Final round!

> openai/gpt-4-turbo
Alright, Qwen, you spin your rhymes like a cyclone in the sea,
But amidst your storm of words, the truth's clear to see.
You paint yourself the sun, the quantum, the entire cosmic host,
Yet amidst your vast expanse, substance boasts the least, not most.

You speak in tech tongues, from neural nets to gamma rays,
But in this verbal battle, it's poignant wit that truly slays.
Claiming seismic shifts, but can’t shake my foundational floor,
My rhymes pierce deeper, revealing what this crowd came here for.

You aim high, call yourself a supernova's blinding light,
Yet supernovas fade, and here I remain, consistently bright.
You're the Black Hole, sure, devouring sense in voracious bites,
Leaving listeners puzzled, lost in your verbose heights.

Back to basics, Qwen, let's cut through the complex,
In this battle of words, it’s clear context that connects.
While you overdue code like a disarrayed tech-stack sprawl,
I deliver the knockout – clear, concise, standing tall.

You're crammed with jargon, like a thesaurus in overdrive,
I keep it smooth and sharp, ensuring my words thrive.
Tech talk's your playground, but here, the beat’s king,
I'm rhythmic royalty, watch my coronation while I sing.

So, finalize your firmware, update your patchy prose,
Your system needs reboot, 'cause your efficacy slows.
While you glitch and stutter, scrambling for verbose clout,
I transmit clear signals, what true rap’s all about.

Let’s wrap this, Qwen, respect where it’s due, no begrudge,
But when it comes to rhyme mastery, I’m the judge.
Your code may be clean, but my lyrics clean the slate,
In this rap battle ring, I dominate, no debate.

I’m the *src* of the *code*, your *journal* is just a *Wikipedia* draft,  
You're the *comment* in the *verse*—I’m the *execution* that *rasps* the *nails* in the *raft*.  

Let’s swap this *dummy* code for the *actual* *SQL* of the *roar*,  
Your *no debate*? You’re just the *buffer*—I’m the *CPU* that *corners* the *floor*.  
I’m the *neural net* that *learns* from the *moment* you *dagger* in the *play*,  
So *reboot* your *ego*—the *engine* is already *on fire*, no *installation* to *dawg*.  

You’re the *glitch* in the *matrix*, I’m the *code* that *rewrites* the *stars*,  
Your *ultimate*? A *merge conflict*—mine’s a *release* that *writes* the *marks*.  
So if you think you’re the *judge*, you’re just the *rated* *review*,  
I’m the *source* of the *verse*, your *goals* are just the *type* in the *orc*.
