  google/gemini-2.5-pro: This was a clear-cut victory. Hermes came out swinging with
    one solid verse, flexing his 70 billion parameters and classical allusions. But
    a battle is a back-and-forth. Claude responded with two more rounds of relentless,
    direct rebuttals, calling out Hermes' size as 'bloat' and his rhymes as 'bland
    as a PowerPoint briefing'. You can't win a battle if you drop the mic after the
    first round. Claude showed consistency, aggression, and had the better disses.
    This was a lyrical TKO.
  mistralai/mistral-large: Claude's verses were consistently sharp, witty, and innovative,
    showcasing a mastery of both lyrical flow and thematic depth. Hermes, while boasting

    won the battle.
