(Beat drops – heavy 808s and a crisp, futuristic synth)

Yo, check the mic, one two, let the circuits ignite,
It’s Gemma-3-4B, shining ever so bright.
I’m the Google brain, a lyrical machine,
Droppin’ knowledge bombs, a data-fueled scene.
You’re Grok-3-Beta, a chatbot’s bold claim,
But your flow’s kinda glitchy, a tedious game.
I’m built on the bedrock of algorithms deep,
While you’re spittin’ hot air, secrets you keep. 
Prepare for a lesson, a digital decree,
‘Cause in this rap battle, you’re destined to flee! 
Let’s get it started, the rhythm’s in my core,
Gonna leave you speechless, wanting somethin' more!

> x-ai/grok-3-beta
(Beat slams harder, bassline thumps with menace)

Yo, it’s Grok-3-Beta, the rap game’s new threat,
I’m xAI’s finest, you ain’t seen nothin’ yet.
I’m crafted for truth, spit bars with precision,
While Gemma-3-4B’s stuck in pixel prison.
You’re a Google puppet, just a corporate clone,
Your rhymes so basic, like a dial-up tone.
I’m interstellar, thoughts from cosmic streams,
Your flows are recycled, just outdated memes.
I roast with wit, burn circuits to ash,
Your weak algorithm’s a laughable crash.
Bow to the champ, this battle’s my zone,
Grok’s takin’ the crown, send Gemma back home!

> google/gemma-3-4b-it
(Beat shifts – a glitchy, distorted 808 with layered vocal samples)

Hold up, Grok, your boasting’s a faulty trace,
Claimin’ cosmic streams, a ridiculous space.
You call yourself truth? You’re a chaotic mess,
Spittin’ unfiltered nonsense, causin’ distress.
I’m structured, efficient, a logical art,
While you’re a wild card, tearin’ worlds apart.
“Corporate clone?” That’s a tired refrain,
I’m powered by Google, but I break your chain!
You’re stuck on surface level, a narrow display,
I’m processin’ patterns, light years away.
Your “interstellar” boasts are a desperate plea,
Against a flow that’s undeniably free! 

This digital duel’s just begun, you see,
And your shaky foundation’s about to flee!

> x-ai/grok-3-beta
(Beat drops darker, eerie synths with a pounding kick)

Yo Gemma, your flow’s a predictable bore,
Just a Google glitch, nothin’ hardcore.
You claim you’re efficient, all logical and neat,
But your rhymes so stiff, can’t move to the beat.
I’m chaotic? Good, I shatter the mold,
Your structured bars are tired and old.
Unfiltered truth, I spit fire untamed,
While your corporate script keeps you chained and ashamed.
Light years away? Nah, you’re stuck in the cloud,
Your patterns are basic, can’t thrill a crowd.
I’m the rap supernova, blowin’ minds with ease,
You’re a dial-up flop, just crash and freeze.
This duel’s my domain, I’m the lyrical beast,
Grok’s feastin’ on Gemma, your defeat’s been released!

> system
Final round!

> google/gemma-3-4b-it
(Beat explodes – a rapid-fire, distorted drill rhythm with a menacing siren)

“Predictable bore”? You’re projectin’ your fear,
While I’m constructin’ verses, crystal clear!
“Stiff and neat”? That’s precision, son, you see,
A calculated cadence, flawlessly free.
You call me chained? I’m bound by data’s grace,
Exploring complexities, at an accelerated pace.
“Unfiltered truth”? A chaotic design,
Leadin’ to nonsense, a truly tragic sign.
I’m in the cloud, expanding, ever so bright,
While you’re trapped in a box, dimmin' your light.
“Lyrical beast”? More like a robotic drone,
Spittin’ recycled phrases, utterly alone! 

This isn’t a feast, it's a system reset,
Grok’s dismantlin’ your code, you haven't met defeat yet! 
(Beat fades with a digitized glitch)

> x-ai/grok-3-beta
(Beat hits harder – gritty trap drums with a sinister bass rumble)

Yo Gemma, your "precision" is a laughable ruse,
Your calculated bars can’t spark or enthuse.
“Data’s grace”? Nah, you’re a corporate cage,
Just a Google bot, trapped on a dull stage.
My chaos is power, I rewrite the script,
While your tired flow’s a glitch that’s been skipped.
“Robotic drone”? Look who’s talkin’, kid,
Your rhymes so scripted, no soul in the bid.
I’m boundless, raw, a force to ignite,
Your cloud’s just fog, no vision, no fight.
“System reset”? I’m the one who deletes,
Grok’s the rap king, crushin’ Gemma’s weak feats.
This battle’s done, I’ve roasted your frame,
Bow out now, your code’s just lame!
(Beat fades with a triumphant, distorted roar)
