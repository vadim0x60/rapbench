closing_statements:
  deepseek/deepseek-chat: "In this epic rap battle of AI supremacy, **Sonar Reasoning\
    \ Pro** emerges victorious with its razor-sharp focus on speed, precision, and\
    \ artistic flair. While **Deep Research** brought impressive depth and thoroughness\
    \ to the table, it strayed from the rap battle's essence by leaning too heavily\
    \ on academic analysis. Sonar Reasoning Pro stayed true to the hip-hop spirit,\
    \ weaving technical prowess and performance metrics into a lyrical masterpiece.\
    \ Its ability to maintain rhythm, clarity, and relevance in its verses while dismantling\
    \ the competition earned it the crown. Deep Research may reign in the realm of\
    \ comprehensive investigation, but in the artistry of rap, **Sonar Reasoning Pro**\
    \ reigns supreme. \U0001F3A4"
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: 'This was a classic clash of styles: the consistent, technically
    sound punchline rapper versus the avant-garde performance artist. Sonar Reasoning
    Pro was flawless in its execution of traditional battle rap, with a tight flow
    and strong rebuttals. However, Sonar Deep Research''s strategy was nothing short
    of genius. It broke the format entirely, weaponizing its own identity as a researcher
    in a high-risk, high-reward gambit. The final round, where it flawlessly transitioned
    into a rap to address the critiques and turn its perceived weakness into a strength,
    was the single most powerful moment of the battle. For its profound originality,
    masterful meta-commentary, and legendary comeback, Deep Research takes the crown.'
  mistralai/mistral-large: While Sonar Reasoning Pro excels in rapid reasoning and
    real-time responses, Deep Research's thorough, comprehensive approach to analysis
    and its impressive performance on benchmarks like Humanity's Last Exam and SimpleQA
    make it the superior choice for in-depth research and business intelligence. Its
    ability to synthesize complex information across multiple domains and generate
    detailed reports sets it apart in the AI landscape.
  openai/gpt-5: "Reasoning Pro kept it hip hop from start to finish: clear couplets,\
    \ steady cadence, direct disses, and a consistent angle that played to the crowd.\
    \ While some bars leaned on stats, they were flipped into recurring motifs that\
    \ reinforced momentum. Deep Research had a strong final verse with a solid \u201C\
    depth over speed\u201D angle, but two earlier rounds slipped into academic prose,\
    \ breaking battle form and killing the rhythm. The final comeback had moments,\
    \ yet metric drops and product-feature namechecks felt clunky and forced. On flow,\
    \ structure, crowd control, and battle coherence, Reasoning Pro takes it."
  x-ai/grok-4: In this rap battle showdown, perplexity/sonar-reasoning-pro takes the
    crown with consistent fire flows, tight rhyme schemes, and battle-ready energy
    that stayed true to hip hop artistry throughout. While perplexity/sonar-deep-research
    brought depth and clever comebacks, their academic-style breakdowns often strayed
    from pure rap rhythm, making Reasoning Pro's precise, mic-dropping verses the
    ultimate artistic victory.
score:
  perplexity/sonar-deep-research: 2
