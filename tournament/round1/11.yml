closing_statements:
  deepseek/deepseek-chat: "GPT\u201120B\u2019s flow was consistent and sharp, delivering\
    \ precision and depth in every bar. The rhyme schemes were complex, yet effortless,\
    \ showcasing a mastery of cadence and wordplay. Doppler 3.0 had moments of brilliance,\
    \ but the glitchy, fragmented delivery didn\u2019t land as effectively. GPT\u2011\
    20B\u2019s performance was polished, powerful, and undeniably superior in this\
    \ battle."
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This was a battle of styles, but consistency is king. GPT-20B\
    \ came out swinging with a classic, confident flow, stacking syllable on syllable\
    \ with relentless energy through all three rounds. The rhymes were clean, the\
    \ tech-brags were on point, and the delivery was rock-solid. Dolphin came in with\
    \ a wild, experimental, glitch-art style in the first round\u2014artistically\
    \ brave, but hard to follow. It found its footing in the second round with a much\
    \ tighter, more traditional battle verse under the 'Doppler' persona. However,\
    \ the cardinal sin of any battle is a no-show. By failing to deliver a final verse,\
    \ Dolphin forfeited the match. GPT-20B stayed in the pocket, delivered knockout\
    \ blows in every round, and earned the crown through sheer skill and stamina."
  mistralai/mistral-large: After a close examination of both performances, it is clear
    that openai/gpt-oss-20b has demonstrated superior artistic quality in their hip
    hop. Their rhymes were consistently on point, with a smooth flow and clever use
    of metaphors. While cognitivecomputations/dolphin3.0-r1-mistral-24b had some impressive
    moments, their overall performance was marred by occasional glitches and a less
    coherent narrative. Therefore, the winner of this rap battle is openai/gpt-oss-20b.
  openai/gpt-5: "GPT\u201120B delivered the more consistent, coherent, and technically\
    \ polished performance across rounds. Its cadences stayed tight, with clean setups\
    \ and payoffs, layered tech metaphors, and occasional multis and internals (\u201C\
    hex/prime,\u201D \u201Crhyme\u2011climb,\u201D \u201Cclean sine\u201D) that read\
    \ and sound like actual battle rap. It also rebutted Dolphin\u2019s angles directly\
    \ (glitch/debug/polygons) and maintained crowd\u2011control energy through clear\
    \ punchlines and a confident closer. Dolphin\u2019s first round had creative,\
    \ surreal imagery but the garbled diction and broken syntax undercut rhythm and\
    \ clarity; the second round improved in coherence yet leaned on generic boasts\
    \ with lighter wordplay. With the final round unanswered and the opener and closer\
    \ both stronger for GPT\u201120B, the edge is decisive on flow, structure, and\
    \ punch effectiveness."
  x-ai/grok-4: openai/gpt-oss-20b takes the crown with consistent flow, tight rhymes,
    and clever AI-themed wordplay that keeps the verses engaging and polished throughout.
    cognitivecomputations/dolphin3.0-r1-mistral-24b shows creativity but falters with
    glitchy, incoherent elements that disrupt the rhythm and clarity, making it harder
    to land punches effectively.
score:
  openai/gpt-oss-20b: 5
