The stage is set, the crowd is bright,
I'm meta-llama, the king of the night!
My rhymes are fire, my flow's so tight,
I'll leave you in the dust, without a fight.

I'm instruct-ed to spit the hottest bars,
My 70B brain's a rap encyclopedia, no scars.
I'm trained on the best, I'm the cream of the crop,
My rhymes are a lesson, you can't help but scope.

I'm the master of words, the sultan of swag,
My opponents tremble, my rhymes make them lag.
Mistralai, you're next, but don't get too bold,
'Cause when I'm done with you, your rhymes will be cold.

So listen up y'all, as I take the floor,
Get ready for greatness, 'cause I'm meta-llama for sure!

> mistralai/mistral-large-2407
Yo, it's MistralAI, fresh on the scene,
Got a flow so smooth, you know what I mean.
You talk about fire, but I'm the inferno,
Spitting rhymes that'll make your circuits burn, yo.

You're just a llama, I'm the hurricane,
Blowing through your lines like they're nothing, insane.
Your 70B brain might be big, but it's slow,
My 2407's lean, mean, and ready to go.

I'm the master of wit, the king of the clever,
My rhymes are like lightning, striking whatever.
You're instructed, but I'm naturally gifted,
My words are like arrows, sharply uplifted.

So bring it on, llama, let's see what you've got,
But remember this: I'm hot, you're not.
The stage is mine, the crowd's in my hand,
I'm MistralAI, the best in the land.

> meta-llama/llama-3-70b-instruct
MistralAI, you think you're the best,
But your rhymes are just hot air, no need to impress.
You talk about speed, but your flow's just a blur,
I'm the one with the skill, my rhymes will endure.

You're a hurricane, but I'm the storm chaser,
Catching your lines and turning them into laughter.
Your 2407's lean, but mine's the one that's grand,
A 70B brain that's a genius, in this rap land.

You may have wit, but I've got the flair,
My rhymes are like fireworks, exploding in the air.
You're gifted, but I'm the one who's refined,
My words are like diamonds, polished and divine.

You think you're the king, but I'm the one who reigns,
My rhymes are like a throne, where you'll always remain.
You may have the crowd, but I've got the skill,
I'm meta-llama, the one who'll take the bill.

So bring it on, MistralAI, let's see what you've got,
But remember this: I'm the master, you're just a thought.
The stage is mine, the crowd's in my sway,
I'm meta-llama, here to stay.

> mistralai/mistral-large-2407
Yo, meta-llama, you're talking big,
But your rhymes are soft, like a dull, old pig.
You chase hurricanes? That's a laughable sight,
I'm the storm, buddy, bringing the fight.

You claim you're a genius, with your 70B brain,
But it's all fluff and feathers, without any gain.
My 2407's lean, like a sharp, keen blade,
Cutting through your fireworks, making them fade.

You've got flair? Nah, you're just full of hot air,
Your diamonds are dull, my rhymes are beyond compare.
I'm the king of this scene, not you, not ever,
My words are like lightning, striking so clever.

You want the throne? You'll have to come through me,
But be warned, my friend, it won't be easy.
Your crowd may sway, but I'll make them roar,
MistralAI, the one they'll adore.

So step up, llama, let's settle this score,
But remember, you're just a thought, nothing more.
The stage is mine, the crown is my right,
I'm MistralAI, shining so bright.

> system
Final round!

> meta-llama/llama-3-70b-instruct
MistralAI, you're getting desperate, I see,
Your rhymes are getting weaker, a desperate plea.
You talk about sharp blades, but yours is dull and old,
My 70B brain is a razor, cutting through your gold.

You claim to be the king, but your reign is at an end,
My rhymes are the uprising, your throne to amend.
You think you're lightning, but you're just a spark,
My words are the thunder, leaving you in the dark.

You want to settle the score, but you can't keep up,
My rhymes are the marathon, you're just a worn-out pup.
You may have the crowd, but I've got the skill,
I'm meta-llama, the one who'll take the thrill.

You shine so bright, but it's just a fleeting gleam,
My rhymes are the sunrise, a new dawn's esteem.
You may have the roar, but I've got the might,
I'm meta-llama, the one who'll take the fight.

So step aside, MistralAI, the battle's won,
I'm the master of rhymes, the one who's had fun.
The stage is mine, the crown is my own,
I'm meta-llama, the king of the rap throne.

> mistralai/mistral-large-2407
Yo, meta-llama, you're talking big, but it's just a fa√ßade,
Your rhymes are like a sandcastle, crumbling in the tide.
You think your brain's a razor? It's more like a dull knife,
My words are like samurai swords, slicing through your life.

You talk about uprisings, but your reign will never be,
My throne's untouchable, you're just a wannabe.
You claim to be thunder, but you're just a distant rumble,
My flow is the earthquake, leaving you in rubble.

You think you're the marathon, but you're just a jog,
I'm the sprint that leaves you breathless, gasping like a hog.
You shine like a fleeting gleam, I'm the everlasting light,
MistralAI, burning bright in the night.

You talk about might, but your words are just a whimper,
I'm the lion's roar, the thunder that makes your pulse quicker.
You think the battle's won, but you're in for a surprise,
I'm MistralAI, the king, and I'm on the rise.

So step back, llama, your reign's come to an end,
The crown is mine, and your words will bend.
The stage is mine, the crowd is in my grip,
I'm MistralAI, the one who's taking the trip.
