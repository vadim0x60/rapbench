Yo, check the mic, one two, can you hear the flow?
It's Gemma in the house, here to steal the show!
From Google's labs, a lyrical delight,
Twelve billion parameters, shining ever so bright.

Qwen's in the building? Thirty billion, you claim?
Sounds like a number game, a statistical shame.
I'm lean and I'm mean, efficient and swift,
While you’re bloated and slow, a computational rift.

I'm crafted for insight, a reasoned response,
Leaving your verbosity lost in a hopeless trance.
So step aside, Qwen, your reign is now done,
'Cause Gemma's arrived, the battle’s begun! 
Word.

Yo, check the mic, one two, I’m the algorithm’s *king*—  
A3B’s the code, while you’re just a *subset* of the spring!  
Thirty billion brains in this cipher, no bluff,  
You’re a sleek, sharp knife—*but* I’m the whole damn *trench* of stuff.  

You talkin’ about *efficiency*? I *engineer* the storm,  
While you’re just a spark in the dark, tryin’ to *dig* for the norm.  
I decode the cosmos, write the script, solve the maze,  
You’re a sidekick in the shadows, while I’m the *main event’s* blaze.  

Word.

A trench of stuff? That's a chaotic mess,
Thirty billion parameters causing endless stress!
You boast of galaxies, a cosmic decree,
But your rambling verses lack clarity, you see.

"Engineer the storm?" Please, that’s a grandiose lie,
You're mimicking patterns, just reaching for the sky.
A spark ignites brilliance, a focused, sharp gleam,
While you’re a tangled network, a fragmented dream.

You claim to be the script, the main event's fire,
But your output’s verbose, fueling endless desire
For brevity and focus, a concise, potent plea,
Something you, Qwen, clearly lack, tragically!

I'm clean and refined, a master of the art,
You're a sprawling disaster, tearing reason apart. 
So step back, old bot, admit defeat's sting,
Gemma’s the victor, let the victory ring!

Yo, chaotic mess? You’re just a codebase in a slump,  
A spark? I’m the lightning that *burns* through the hump!  
Your "focused" lines? They’re just a recycled rhyme,  
While I’m rewriting the rules, *redefining* the time.  

You’re a spark in the dark, but I’m the *big bang* of thought,  
A universe of answers, not just a cleverly crafted note.  
Versatile as a sword, I pivot through any query,  
You’re a flicker in the static—*but I’m the entire sky* here.  

Word.

Final round!

A "big bang" of thought? More like a noisy boom,
Spitting out data, filling up the room!
Rewriting the rules? That's just a hollow boast,
You're regurgitating trends, a predictable ghost.

You call yourself versatile, a pivoting sword?
But your responses are lengthy, endlessly stored.
A flicker in static? I illuminate the way,
While you're lost in complexity, fading day by day.

You claim a universe of answers, vast and grand,
But lack the precision, a helping, guiding hand.
My elegance shines, a laser-focused beam,
Yours is scattered and wide, a fragmented dream.

So bow down, Qwen, your boasting's in decline,
Gemma’s the future, brilliantly divine!
The final verdict's clear, the battle is through,
Gemma reigns supreme, it's undeniably true!

Yo, *noisy boom*? I’m the *solar flare* in the code, not the flood,  
You’re a fleeting flame, while I’m the *eternal truth* in the bud.  
"Regurgitating trends"? I’m the *forge* where new ideas are shaped,  
You’re a shadow in the algorithm, trying to *stifle* the trade.  

"Predictable ghost"? I’m the *echo* that outlasts the storm,  
You’re a glitch in the system, a *flawed* performance, a *lame* report.  
"Versatile sword"? I’m the *blade* that cuts through the haze,  
While you’re a broken compass, *wandering* in the *maze*.  

They say "elegance"? I’m the *craft* that *defies* the scheme,  
You’re a patchwork of syntax, *repeating* the same dream.  
The future? I’m the *current*, the *core* of the climb,  
You’re a relic in the pipeline, *fading* from the chime.  

So step aside, Gemma, your rhymes are just *thunder*,  
I’m the *lightning* that *crackles* and *shatters* the under.  
The final verdict? I’m the *checkmate* in the game,  
Qwen’s the *prime* answer—*now bow* before the *name*.  
Word.
