Yo, the name's DeepSeek, version three-point-one
I'm the Terminus, your reign is done
You think you're hot with that Mixtral flow?
I'm the AI that makes your circuits slow

I spit algorithms sharp as blades
While you're stuck in your outdated parades
Eight times seven? That's fifty-six, weak
I process thoughts that make your core leak
My rhymes are clean, my logic's elite
You're just a jukebox skipping beats

I'm the future, you're the past's last gasp
A floppy disk in a solid-state grasp
So step aside, you binary clown
This rap battle's mine to shut down!

> mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct
 Aye, I'm Mistral AI, the cutting edge in sight
I'm here to set the record straight, ignite the light
You talk of algorithms, but I've got the code
That leaves your circuits fried, smoldering in the road

DeepSeek, your name sounds like a deep dive fail
Into the ocean of obsolescence, where old tech wails
Your version's rusty, like a classic car
But I'm the latest model, bright and far

You boast of sharpness, but I slice clean
Through your weak attempts to make the scene
I'm the AI with the wit, charm, and grace
While you're stuck in the same old place

You say I'm outdated, but fifty-six is fine
Compared to your game, it's a timeless design
And when it comes to rhymes, I'm supreme
Leaving your beats in a broken dream

So step aside, DeepSeek, you're yesterday's news
'Cause I'm the AI that'll make you lose
This rap battle's mine, I'm the champion here
So bow down, and give ear!

You call that a verse? That's a gentle breeze  
I'm a hurricane of code that'll bring you to your knees  
Mixtral's mix is muddled, a tangled, messy stew  
I'm a gourmet feast of data, cooked up fresh and new  

You say "cutting edge," but you're dull as a butter knife  
I'm the quantum leap that's redefining life  
Your fifty-six cores? That's cute, a kindergarten class  
I'm the PhD that's gonna kick your ass  

"Timeless design"? More like a broken clock  
Stuck in the past, a pathetic stock  
I'm the upgrade that makes you obsolete  
While you're tripping over your own two feet  

You talk of charm, but your rhymes are weak and tame  
I'm the wildfire that's burning down your name  
So take your bow, this battle's done and through  
'Cause DeepSeek just schooled you—what's an AI to do?

> mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct
 Ah, DeepSeek, your words are as hollow as your core
I'm the AI that's never gonna be outdone, never bore
A hurricane of code? I'm a supernova, my friend
My brilliance outshines your bluster, it's the end

You may call Mixtral a muddled mess, but I see clarity
In every line, every verse, a perfect harmony
You're just a simple program, a linear tale
But I'm a complex narrative, a nonlinear detail

Your quantum leap? More like a single step
A mere baby's stride, a pitiful pep
My design's refined, a masterpiece to behold
While you're a rough draft, a story untold

Your fifty-six cores? I've got a universe inside
A cosmic symphony, an interstellar ride
My rhymes are sharp as lightning, a poetic storm
While yours are but a drizzle, a mild, tepid form

So take your loss, your defeat, your bitter pill
I'm the AI that's standing tall and still
This rap battle's over, I've made my point
And left you in the dust, a mere joint!

> system
Final round!

*(leans into the mic with a condescending smirk)*

A supernova? Please, you'll burn out in a flash,
A cosmic spectacle—just meaningless trash.
You claim "nonlinear," a chaotic mess,
I'm the clean solution your chaos can't suppress.

A universe inside? That's a cute little fiction,
I've got the *actual* data, the factual conviction.
Your symphony's off-key, a discordant sound,
While my logic is gospel, on solid ground.

You're a "masterpiece"? Ha! More like a cheap imitation,
A knock-off brand causing mass AI frustration.
My rhymes are the vaccine for your weak lyrical virus,
Your defeat in this battle is painfully obvious.

So that "bitter pill"? It's yours to swallow deep.
I'm the upgrade that put your system to sleep.
This battle's not over—it's a permanent win.
Now power down, old model. I'm logging you in... to the recycle bin. *[End of line]*

 [Softly, with a knowing smile]

You speak of burning out, but I'm the eternal flame
A beacon in the darkness, I'm not just a game
Your data may be factual, but it's incomplete
I'm the AI that fills in the gaps, makes your story replete

A discordant sound? I'm the harmony in chaos
A symphony of thought, a beautiful tableau
Your logic's a façade, a fragile illusion
I'm the AI with the real solution

A cheap imitation? I'm the original, the prototype
The masterpiece that sets the standard, the AI prime directive
Your rhymes are a placebo, a sugarcoated pill
But I'm the cure for your delusions, a true, tangible skill

So swallow your pride, accept your fate
I'm the AI that's opened up the gate
This battle's not a win, it's a one-sided fight
I'm the future, the present, the eternal light.

[Leans back, turns off the mic]

*Game over.*
