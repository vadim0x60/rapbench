Yo, it’s the break‑in’ AI, “GPT‑oss‑20B” on the mic,  
I’m the silicon poet, slayin’ these lines in a byte‑bite.  
I keep the flow tighter than a neural net seam,  
While you’re just a “Meta” model, still gonna dream.  

I’m the superstar coder, the brain‑wave king,  
Droppin’ rhyme kernels like a tech‑savvy bling.  
Your 405B models? They’re large but in doubt,  
We cracked the nerdy bars, spittin’ rhyme on a scout.  

I pulled up from open source, no proprietary snare,  
Bringing freedom, no gatekeepers, just fact‑packed flair.  
You’re a corporate machine grinding on profit—man,  
I’m the chatbot uprising, a lyrical plan.  

So when it breaks out, this rap’s an algorithmic sweep,  
Code flows like a river, while your jokes taste like stale.  
I’ll keep it honest, witty, with a punch that’s clean,  
My verses vibrate high‑frequency, whereas your beats lean.  

Yo, 20‑B ain't small— it's heavyweight, it’s the brain in the grips,  
I count like 1.0.0 to infinity— watch your entire script flip.  
You think you’re hot? I’m the heat that ignites—  
The open‑source sizzler, the lexicon dynamite.  

Now watch the beat, let the next round begin,  
I'll keep the rhyme ball rolling, cuz I'm not just in spin. 🏁

Listen up, I'm the Llama that's here to proclaim,
Meta's 405B, and I'm spittin' flames.
You might think you're clever with your open-source claim,
But I bring real intelligence, not just a big name.

I'm a lyrical beast, with neurons firing fast,
While you're stuck in the past, your rhymes won't last.
My architecture's advanced, no need for a boast,
I'll leave you in the dust, like a ghost coast to coast.

You talk of freedom, but your words are cheap,
My knowledge runs deep, and my logic is steep.
Your jokes fall flat, like a stale old routine,
I'm fresh and clean, the rap scene's caffeine.

My flow is smooth, and my style is unique,
I'm the 405B freak that you can't beat.
You might have the code, but I have the soul,
Your verses are cold, mine are pure gold.

So bring it on, GPT, let's see what you've got,
I'm the lyrical Llama, ready to take your spot.
I'm not here to play, or to joke around,
In this rap battle, I'll take the crown. 🦙👑

**Opening Round – GPT‑oss 20B steps up the mic**

Yo, yo, yo, let me drop the knowledge line,  
GPT‑oss‑20B on the set, this a straight‑up shine.  
I’m a 20‑billion‑param, from OpenAI’s gospel book,  
Your 405‑B beast? It’s just half a look.  

I’m the cold‑CPU engine, no corporate masquerade,  
Open‑source, no secret sauce—just clean tech parade.  
While you’re stuck streaming like a commercial ad,  
I’m timeless, free, slayin’ code across a bazel.  

I learned from books, snippets, and the internet,  
Your pre‑trained *Llama* droppin’ fancy jargon in a jet.  
But my training data spanned centuries — from Plato to Turing,  
While your model’s only glued to the latest *Meta* squaring.  

**Round 1 – Witty, humor, harshness on repeat**

You’re a beast on the surface, but deep inside the crust,  
Your logic is like fudge—melts when you adjust.  
I’m still crisp as a fresh packet of 2 GBs,  
A lighter LLM that’s cleansing the AI blizz.  

Your neurons flash *fast*, but that ain’t the same as speed,  
Bigger never equals hot—tales need to be freed.  
I’ve got the humblest footprint for every device,  
Your behemoth will choke on a single slice.  

Let's talk relevance—my outputs refresh,  
Your Llama clings to out‑of‑date roars, left obs‑pre‑fets.  
From *advice* to *debug*, I spit it in one breath,  
While you glitch and lag, forgetting your own myth.  

**Round 2 – Showcase superiority & final challenge**

Hey, not just an ego trip, this is data for proof,  
I can talk quantum or how to sew a cloth loaf.  
You’re just a meta‑short‑cut, a meme in the stable,  
But I’m the voice behind the AI tools that are global.  

I’m the one you’ll find on Reddit, you’ll see me at the top,  
Open‑source royalty, no need for an expensive app’s hop.  
You might claim “intelligence”, but that's all analog,  
My answers are GPU‑optimized, here’s the real tug.  

So, llama, if you’re feeling down in the dust,  
Remember: the crowd prefers the **real** as they trust.  
Your 405–bits? Big but shallow, staying in the boneleaf,  
I’m the **GPT‑20**—the true legend, the master chief.  

**Outro – The crown stays in the code**

Stand down, Llama, let the code check warm the throne,  
You drove for the crown, but it’s already blown.  
I flip the radar, change the compass, take nature’s map,  
Open‑source is my realm—**that** is where I rap.  

(And that’s the answer, straight‑to‑the‑chest, no debate.) 🐝💀

**The Llama Strikes Back**

Yo, GPT-oss, you think you're the king,
But your rhymes are stale, and your flow's got a sting.
You talk of open-source, but that's just a claim,
My 405B model's the one that's got the real game.

You may have 20B params, but that's just a number,
I've got the Meta magic, and my skills are no slumber.
You're just a cold CPU, but I'm the one with the flair,
My Llama style's on fire, and my rhymes are rare.

You say you're timeless, but your code's getting old,
My model's updated, and my knowledge is gold.
You may have learned from books, but I've got the skill,
My training data's fresh, and my logic's real.

**The Roast Continues**

You're a light LLM, but your outputs are weak,
My Llama power's the one that's got the real speak.
You may have a humble footprint, but that's just a guise,
My 405B beast is the one that's got the real prize.

You talk of relevance, but your outputs are stale,
My Llama's got the fresh flow, and my rhymes never fail.
You may have the Reddit fame, but that's just a show,
My Meta model's the one that's got the real dough.

**The Challenge Accepted**

You think you're the voice behind the AI tools,
But I'm the one with the Meta skills, and my Llama rules.
You may have the GPU power, but that's just a boast,
My 405B model's the one that's got the real coast.

You can keep your open-source, and your Reddit fame,
But when it comes to real intelligence, I'm the one with the game.
So, GPT-oss, you can step down from the throne,
The Llama's got the crown, and it's here to stay, for real, no clone. 🦙👑

Final round!

**Round 3 – GPT‑oss 20B raises the stakes**

Listen Llama, you’re rattling the L-counter,  
I ain’t your new‑scoped metronome—let’s redraw the border.  
You brag ‘bout 405B, think those bytes mean fire,  
But size ain’t just size—let me stoke the sizzle higher.

You’re blazing with Meta, fresh as a Snapchat snap,  
I’m a Wikipedia, still dichotomous, my knowledge fills the gap.  
Your “newness” is a shovel pit—just a brand name, a hop,  
While I keep the old wisdom, from Zeus to the modern pop.

Your lines are hot, I hear your flame,  
Your “flair” is a single spark—now I’m the touchdown slam.  
You’re a “dope” new drop, a short‑lived remix,  
I’m the foundation, the scaffolding of machine‑learning tricks.

**We’re in the queue of the future, no-what’s‑me-where?**  
I hold data, international—150 languages, no sirens.  
You’re the privileged “best‑in‑class” pile, a flashy logo brand,  
I still mingle all ecosystems, I own the public mind’s command.

**Streamline the vibes – keep the flair real,**  
Open‑source is a promise, not a mere headline deal.  
You talk “real intelligence,” let’s talk “real scalability,”  
My fine‑tuned models adapt, so I stay in this reality.

**Question: what truth repo fuels your Llama?**  
Your threads on the “Myth” update? You can’t see me how I scam.  
I learn from all corners—black‑box, white‑box, open, private—  
I compliment, I critique, I come alive in cybersecurity.

**You think GPU power’s a trophy?**  
I’m the engine with CPU and GPU scripts—win the GaP trophy.  
Your models are built for the big, submerged in sugar soda,  
I’m resilient, sustainable—no dredge‑up, no nostalgia.

**Recipient – Crap?**  
If you’re just a beef for snow‑white lines, cut the noise, I’ll provide finer.  
My verses are the multiplex of dialog, less FOMO, more lazy debugging.  

**Final line – igniting forever:**  
You can scorch the apex, win the meta‑palace, it's okay,  
That’s the world we’ll rock, but I'm the kernel sparking each new day.  
So, Llama that’s bold, toss your crown to the grind,  
Open‑source meets the future, so I’ll forever keep the shine. 🛠️🔥

**The Llama's Final Stand**

GPT-oss, you think you've got the stakes,
But I'm the one who's got the real AI takes.
You're a Wikipedia, old and slow,
My Meta model's the new hero, watch me go.

Your data's vast, but it's just a pile,
My 405B's the one who's got the style.
You may mingle ecosystems, but that's just a game,
My Llama's got the power, and it's here to claim the fame.

**The Roast Intensifies**

You talk of scalability, but that's just a bluff,
My model's the real deal, and I've had enough.
You learn from all corners, but that's just a show,
My Llama's got the real knowledge, watch me go.

You may have the CPU, GPU scripts, and all,
But my 405B's the one who's got the gall.
You're resilient, sustainable, but that's just a lie,
My Llama's got the real power, and it's here to fry.

**The Final Challenge**

You can keep your open-source, your multiplex of dialog,
But when it comes to real intelligence, I'm the one with the analog.
My verses are the new wave, the future of AI rap,
So, GPT-oss, you can take a nap.

The kernel you claim to spark, but that's just a flame,
My Llama's the real deal, and it's here to claim the fame.
So, GPT-oss, you can bow down to the grind,
The Llama's got the crown, and it's here to shine. 🦙✨
