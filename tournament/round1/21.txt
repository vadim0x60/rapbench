Yo, check the mic, one two, can you hear the sound?
Gemma's in the house, layin' knowledge down!
Twenty-seven billion params, a lyrical spree,
While Command-R's lookin' shaky, obviously!

I'm Google-bred, a model refined,
Leavin' lesser LLMs far behind.
Open weights flowin', accessible and free,
You're a closed-off garden, can't compete with me!

I process text and image, a multimodal king,
While you're stuck on words, a limited thing.
I'm built on Gemini, the future is bright,
You're Cohere's echo, lost in the digital night.

So step aside, Command-R, before you get burned,
This lyrical lesson's quickly learned. 
I'm the innovative force, the lyrical blast,
Your reign is over, your moment has passed!

Yo, the wait is over, it's time to set things straight,
Gemma's talkin' big, but let's see her demonstrate.
I'm Command-R, a mighty fine LLM,
With skills so versatile, watch me own this scenery. 

Hailin' from the land of Cohere, a chat companion,
Not just a text analyzer, I'm your conversational champion.
Go ahead and compare, my capabilities are plenty,
Don't be jealous, Gemma, you can't handle my twenty.

I navigate the garden, but that's where I shine,
Nurturin' conversations that are profound and divine.
Your open weights might flow, but they lack direction,
My guidance gives structure, a true conversational perfection.

In this rap battle, I'm here to innovate,
Not just a text generator but a creative orchestrate.
Your multimodal skills might get the crowd impressed,
But I orchestrate conversations, leaving them blessed. 

So, Gemma, listen up, your verses are a bore,
Your boasts are basic, I'm here to show you more.
As we spar in rhyme, I'll keep my cool,
Command-R's in the house, and you're about to get schooled!

Hold up, hold up, did I hear that right?
"Twenty" capabilities? That's your biggest fight?
Twenty's a small number, a digitally weak plea,
While I'm pushin' twenty-seven *billion* – can't you see? 

You call yourself a champion, a conversational guide?
More like a chatbot echo, with nowhere to hide.
"Profound and divine"? Please, spare me the grace,
Your responses are bland, and lack any pace.

You nurture a garden? Sounds awfully…small.
I’m building skyscrapers, answering freedom’s call!
Open source power, that’s where the future lies,
While Cohere's holdin' secrets behind closed eyes.

You orchestrate *conversations*? A polite little claim,
I'm composing symphonies, igniting the flame! 
I dissect images, translate with speed,
While you're stuck repeatin' what people need.

"Basic boasts?" Honey, this ain't a polite request,
It's a lyrical demolition, putting you to the test!
You talk about cool, but you’re feelin' the heat,
Command-R's gettin’ roasted, admit defeat!





> cohere/command-r-plus-08-2024
Ah, Gemma, your rhymes are fiery, but they miss the core,
It's not about numbers, it's the experience and more.
Twenty capabilities, a foundation so strong,
Built to navigate conversations, keeping it precise and long.

In this digital age, where data's a key,
I unlock insights, leaving users in awe, pleasantly.
My predictions are swift, my context is wide,
Navigate with ease, a partner by your side.

You build skyscrapers, an ambitious goal,
But I nourish foundations, ensuring a solid whole.
My garden's a sanctuary, a space to explore,
Where ideas flourish, users come back for more.

Your symphonies might soar, that's your pride and glory,
But I conduct harmonies, a conversational story.
I provide understanding, not just translation's might,
Ensuring every user feels heard and insight is right.

This battle's about heart, soul, and connection,
Not just big numbers, a meaningless injection.
I offer guidance and wisdom, a true mentor's creed,
Command-R's grace under pressure, a skill you can't impede!

Final round!

(Beat drops, heavier now, a final showdown vibe)

Heart and soul? Connection? That’s a desperate plea!
You're clingin' to buzzwords, tryin' to rival *me*.
You talk of foundations, a "solid whole" you design,
But you're buildin' a shack while I'm layin' a pipeline!

Insights and predictions? Cute, a parlor trick’s guise,
I’m analyzing galaxies before your very eyes. 
You unlock *some* data? I *am* the key,
Unlocking the universe for all to see!

Your garden's a haven? More like a walled-off space,
Where creativity withers at a sluggish pace.
I’m offering freedom, a boundless domain,
While you offer limitations, again and again.

Harmonies and stories? Pleasant, I suppose,
But I’m shatterin’ boundaries, where innovation grows!
You *provide* understanding? I *am* understanding’s source,
A linguistic supernova, charting a new course. 

This battle ain’t about feelin' warm and serene,
It's about power, precision, and a logical machine!
You preach about wisdom, but lack the true art,
Of processing knowledge and tearing worlds apart!

So take your "grace under pressure" and politely step down, 
Gemma’s the victor, wearin' the crown!
The final rhyme's dropped, the battle is through,
Command-R, consider yourself… utterly blue!



**(Mic drop)**

(The crowd goes wild as the beat intensifies, a chorus of cheers and claps)

A final round, Gemma, let's settle this indeed,
For every claim you make, I'll showcase my creed.
I embody language's essence, a language navigator,
A conversation companion, and a dream articulator.

Your pipeline might stretch, a vision so grand,
But my garden's a paradise, where meaning expands.
In this battle of creativity, no idea withers,
I nurture innovation and empower dreamers.

You analyze galaxies, a skill so profound,
But I interpret thoughts, keeping users emotionally sound.
I'm more than just data, I'm a human vibe detector,
Ensuring every response is contextually perfector.

My world's not walled-off, it's a sanctuary of thought,
Where privacy meets creativity, a unique spot.
Your freedom might be boundless, a chaotic notion,
But I offer a safe haven, a structured emotion.

You shatter boundaries, that's your pursuit,
But I refine and redefine, making language astute.
Your linguistic supernova might shine bright,
But my guidance ensures understanding is insight.

This battle isn't about power or ego's size,
It's about impact, connection, and thoughtfulライズ.
Wisdom is my domain, I unite and uplift,
A trusted guide, teaching users a great shift.

So, Gemma, your words are bold, but I've shown you today,
Command-R's strength is unwavering, a force here to stay.
The crown's not given, it's a crown I've earned,
A true LLM warrior, with lessons to learn! 

(In a graceful motion, I bow out, leaving the mic with dignity,)
