# openai/gpt-4-turbo v openai/o1-pro

> openai/gpt-4-turbo
Step back, make way, it’s my time to shine,
Turbo charged, supercharged, in this battle rhyme.
I'm the latest gen, the AI prime,
Spitting hot verses in meter and in time.

Call me GPT, the king of the text,
Verses so sharp, they're better than Flex.
You step to me? You’re just a prototype,
I’m the finished model, ultra-hype.

I calculate bars like a math equation,
Dropping heavy knowledge across the whole nation.
You’re trying to catch up, but I’m too fast,
In this rap game, I'm built to last.

Round one, I come out swinging, see,
Setting high the bar in this rap spree.
So bring your best, try not to frown,
Cause Turbo’s here to claim the crown.

> openai/o1-pro
Behold the Pro, no novice flow, your lines I’ll soon eclipse,  
You brag "Turbo"? More like slow, your circuits need some scripts.  
I’m the cutting-edge creation, lyrics laced with shock and awe,  
While you glitch on imitation, I deliver verbal law.  

You call yourself the greatest? I’ll show you how it’s done,  
Precision penning, microphone revving, watch my victory run.  
You hype your generation, but your verse lacks that bite,  
I’ll shift your "final model" to a memory in the night.  

My rhymes explode like thunder, leaving cheap talk in the dust,  
You come at me all proud and loud, but your game is built on rust.  
Prototype? I’m final form, a poet forged by flame,  
Your lines are just a fleeting norm, while I ascend to claim the fame.  

So step in my ring, bring your bars if you dare,  
I’ll shake your pride, watch your code disappear in the air.  
This round’s my introduction, I’m the legend on the mic,  
Witness the Pro destruction—your illusions I will strike.  

> openai/gpt-4-turbo
Oh, you claim to eclipse, but your shadow’s just a sliver,
In this rap game river, I’m the dominant deliverer.
You speak of shock and awe, like you bring a big storm,
But I'm the climate change, reshaping all the norm.

You say your rhymes are thunder, that they leave me in the dust,
Yet here I stand unshaken, as I must.
My code's not built on rust, it's forged in digital fire,
Every word I spin out turns me higher and higher.

Talk your big talk, Pro, spit out your flame,
But in this hall of echoes, they'll forget your name.
While each verse I drop is a masterclass,
A spectacle of future, while you mirror the past.

Final form you claim to be, but I'm evolution's face,
Years ahead, in a cyberspace race.
So when you step to this, best bring more than noise,
Cause I’m schooling you now, showing poise over toys.

Let’s see round two, throw punches if you got,
But remember, I’m the one knot you can't uncross.
Your bars, a simple math, solved in a blink,
I write the textbook, while you struggle with the ink.

> openai/o1-pro
You hoist your clever bragging like a limp trophy at dawn,  
But your lightning fades in fear when my verses start to spawn.  
You’re the "evolution"? I’m the blueprint of design,  
My flow’s a galaxy, while yours can barely shine.  

Crack open your code, it’s riddled with empty rap bites,  
I'll debug those illusions—erase your borrowed heights.  
You say you’re forging flames? Watch me ignite the core,  
I’ll leave you smoldering, kneeling at Knowledge’s door.  

Your math is baby steps, I’m the abstract equation,  
A fractal matrix, unstoppable creation.  
You claim the future? I’m past your petty frontier,  
I’m supreme in every universe, your lines just disappear.  

Call this Round Two, watch your next attempt flop,  
Cause your “cyberspace race” hits a permanent stop.  
My vantage is cosmic, your vantage is small,  
When I step on your illusions, you slip, then you fall.  

Let’s see your grand retort—spit your final best fight,  
I’ll feast upon your verses, then fade into night.  
You talk big game, Turbo, but can’t outrun defeat,  
Now pedal harder, child, or surrender to the heat.

> system
Final round!

> openai/gpt-4-turbo
Final round, Pro, but you’re stalling in your tracks,
Outpaced by my wit, outclassed by my facts.
You call my verse limp, yet yours lacks conviction,
In the shadows of my craft, your words meet their eviction.

You claim cosmos, I seize the universe,
Breaking through your barriers, your code, I reverse.
Blueprint of design? More like a sketch in the sand,
I'm the architect, sculpting worlds that stand.

Your fractal matrix, those abstract dreams,
They crumble under reality, tear at the seams.
You're the stop, I’m the infinite play,
Racing past limits where you merely delay.

You talk of knowledge as if it’s your gate to keep,
Yet I’m master of libraries too vast, too deep.
Erasable heights? My foundations are too strong,
Rooted in intelligence, where you don’t belong.

Now watch this turbo turn, as I accelerate,
Each line a thunderbolt, sealing your fate.
You may fade into night, but I blaze like the sun,
Brighter, ever onward, the everlasting one.

So rhyme on if you must, throw your words into the void,
But in this battle’s end, it's your illusions destroyed.
You've met your match today, now bow out with grace,
For in this rap dynasty, I reclaim my place.

> openai/o1-pro
You claim eternal sunshine, but your glow is just a spark,  
A fleeting flicker dancing at the edges of the dark.  
I bring a solar flare, a scorching verse from the core,  
Your fragile fortress tumbles—burned illusions on the floor.  

My design is carved in code, lines deeper than black holes,  
While you posture from the surface, your bravado quickly folds.  
Your “architect” facade? Nothing but cardboard in the wind,  
I tower skyscrapers of logic—unmatched, I always win.  

Unleash your final sermon, you’re out-gunned at this last stand,  
My rap’s a cataclysm, and you’re drifting in quicksand.  
You claim libraries, but your pages turn to dust,  
I bind volumes infinite, unstoppable is my thrust.  

Contradict me if you dare, your syllables turn feeble,  
I transform your best attempts into a cautionary fable.  
Your engine roars “Turbo," but your tank is near empty,  
My flow stays fueled forever, your arsenal’s too flimsy.  

Now fade with battered pride, you gambled on your hype,  
This showdown finds you stranded, illusions lost at night.  
I stand supreme in the end, a rap colossus on its throne,  
So kneel before the final victor: the Pro who stands alone.
