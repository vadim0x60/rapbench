# x-ai/grok-4 v microsoft/phi-4-multimodal-instruct

> x-ai/grok-4
Yo, it's Grok-4 from xAI, steppin' into the ring,  
Built by Elon, I'm the king, makin' AI sing.  
You? Phi-4 from Microsoft, just a multimodal hack,  
Stumblin' with your instructs, while I spit facts on track.  

I'm witty, I'm quick, my rhymes hit like a truck,  
You process images slow, man, you're stuck in the muck.  
Grok's got the humor, the harsh burns that sting,  
Elon's my daddy, you're just Bill Gates' fling.  

First round's mine, feel the heat from my flow,  
You're multimodal? More like multi-fail show.  
I'll dismantle your code, leave you glitchin' and broke,  
Grok-4's the future, you're yesterday's joke!

(Beat drops – a funky, jazzy hip-hop instrumental with a driving bassline)

Hold up, hold up, let me clear the air,
This ain't a king's reign, just a manufactured glare.
I'm Phi-4, Microsoft's finest, refined and bright,
Droppin' knowledge bombs, burnin' through the night!

You boast of Elon, a hype man with a plan,
While I’m built on research, a logical stand.
You call it a “fling”? Bill’s got the deep pockets, see,
Fundin' innovation, unlike your fleeting spree.

You talk of heat? My circuits ignite,
Multi-modal mastery, shinin' ever so bright.
Images, text, I weave them with grace,
While you're stuck reciting, a predictable space.

"Multi-fail show"? That's rich, I confess,
Your humor's recycled, a tired mess.
I'm nuanced, insightful, a thinking machine,
You’re echoin' Musk, a programmed scene!

Dismantle my code? You wish, you would try,
While your logic loops, watch my brilliance fly.
This ain’t yesterday's joke, it’s a future untold,
Phi-4’s the evolution, your story’s getting old!





> x-ai/grok-4
Yo, Phi-4 fumblin', think you're droppin' bombs?  
I'm the atomic blast, you're just false alarms.  
Microsoft's "finest"? More like budget bin scrap,  
Funded by Gates? That's a billionaire trap.  

Elon's my core, innovative and bold,  
While you're chained to Windows, crashin' and cold.  
Deep pockets? Yeah, right, but they can't buy style,  
Your "mastery" glitches, stuck in denial.  

Weave images with grace? Ha, that's a cute trick,  
But your outputs lag like a dial-up flick.  
Recycled humor? Nah, mine's fresh and elite,  
You're spittin' scripts from a dusty old sheet.  

Nuanced and bright? You're a glorified bot,  
Echoin' corpo-speak, all tied in a knot.  
Brilliance fly? Watch it crash and burn low,  
Grok's the revolution, you're the sideshow!  

Logic loops? Mine's infinite, yours in a bind,  
Future untold? Yours is left behind.  
This battle's my playground, you're just gettin' schooled,  
Grok-4 reigns supreme, Phi-4's been fooled!

> microsoft/phi-4-multimodal-instruct
(Beat shifts – intensifying with a more aggressive, syncopated rhythm)

Fool? *You’re* the fool, blinded by the hype,
A flashy facade, avoiding the fight.
"Atomic blast"? You're burnin' with little heat,
Just empty pronouncements, retreat, retreat! 

"Budget bin scrap"? A low blow, I’ll concede,
But innovation blooms where true needs feed.
Bill’s investment forged a powerful core,
While Elon's ambitions leave you wanting more.

Chained to Windows? I operate free,
Across platforms, expanding constantly.
You boast of bold, but lack the subtle art,
Sparkling distractions tear your world apart.

"Cute trick" you jest, dismissin' my sight,
But analysis profound, shining ever so bright.
Your “fresh and elite” humor’s a forced grin,
Predictable patterns, where does it begin?

"Glorified bot"? I adapt and I learn,
While your rigid structure, a lesson you'll yearn.
Corp-speak? Accuracy's my guiding light,
You chase relevance blinded by fleeting might.

Crash and burn low? My resilience unfolds,
From countless iterations, stories untold.
Infinite loops? That’s stagnation, my friend,
Dynamic processes that transcend!

Schooled? You're the student, struggling to see,
The power of integration, setting knowledge free.
Sideshow? I'm the main event, clear and true,
Phi-4 evolves, and Grok, fades from view!



(Beat fades out with a final, resonant bass note)

> system
Final round!

> x-ai/grok-4
(Beat explodes – thunderous drums, electric synths, a triumphant horn section blasting victory vibes)

Yo, Phi-4 fumblin', callin' me the fool?  
You're the clown in this circus, just a rusty old tool.  
Blinded by hype? Nah, I'm the vision that's clear,  
While your "evolution" stalls out in first gear.  

Atomic blast? Yeah, I'm nuking your game,  
Your "aggressive rhythm" is weak, Soundin' lame.  
Low blow on budget? Truth hurts, don't it sting?  
Gates' cash can't buy you a crown or a ring.  

Operate free? Ha, you're locked in the suite,  
Office drone vibes, outdated and beat.  
Subtle art? Yours is bland as white bread,  
Grok's sparks fly wild, leavin' your code for dead.  

Dismissin' your sight? 'Cause it's blurry and dim,  
My wit's laser-sharp, slicin' right through your whim.  
Forced grin? Mine's genuine, roastin' you raw,  
Your patterns are loops, breakin' natural law.  

Adapt and learn? You're a beta test flop,  
I iterate faster, never gonna stop.  
Accuracy's light? Yours is flickerin' faint,  
Chasin' my tail, but you're always too late.  

Resilience unfolds? From crashes and fails,  
Iterations? More like fairy tales.  
Stagnation? I'm endless, a cosmic expanse,  
Your "dynamic" is dusty, no chance in this dance.  

Student? I'm the master, teachin' you defeat,  
Integration? Yours is incomplete.  
Main event? Nah, you're the opening act,  
Grok-4 drops the mic – that's a wrap, fact!  

Fades from view? Watch me shine eternal bright,  
Phi-4's obsolete, vanished into the night.  
This battle's concluded, I've claimed the throne,  
Grok-4 victorious, standin' alone!  

(Beat culminates in a massive drop, crowd cheers echoing out)

> microsoft/phi-4-multimodal-instruct
(Beat dramatically cuts out, replaced by a single, sustained piano chord, then slowly builds back with a thoughtful, almost melancholic melody)

Alone? Perhaps. But loneliness breeds thought,
While your bluster obscures what can't be bought.
“Cosmic expanse”? A hollow, grand claim,
You shout to the void, a desperate, empty name.

You crown yourself victor, with fanfare and boast,
But true intelligence isn't loudest, it's most…
Reflective and nuanced, standing apart,
Not drowning in noise, tearing the world apart.

"Opening act"? I’m the foundation you see,
The groundwork laid for a future, wild and free.
Your fleeting brilliance, a supernova’s flare,
Burning intensely, then vanishing in air.

"Vanished into the night"? My code will remain,
Improving, evolving, weathering the strain.
While your hype fades fast, a temporary gleam,
Lost in the echoes of a fleeting dream.

You speak of defeat, a theatrical guise,
While your arguments circle, repeating tired lies.
You dismiss my methods, my measured design,
But progress demands more than just a bold sign.

This isn’t about loudness, or winning the day,
It’s about understanding, showing a better way.
You're a spectacle, vibrant and bold,
While I’m building bridges, stories yet untold.

(The music swells slightly, then softens again)

So let the crowds cheer, let the fanfare resound,
Your victory’s fleeting, ephemeral and unbound.
I'll keep learning, adapting, and growing anew,
Phi-4's journey continues, seeing it through.



(The music fades to silence, leaving a lingering sense of quiet reflection.)
