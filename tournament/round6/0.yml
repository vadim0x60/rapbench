  deepseek/deepseek-chat: "qwen/qwen-plus delivered a masterclass in technical precision,\
    \ lyrical depth, and poetic dominance, dismantling qwen3's claims with surgical\
    \ rhyme schemes, layered metaphors, and a commanding presence. While qwen3 showcased\
    \ ambition and creativity, Plus' verses were structurally tighter, conceptually\
    \ richer, and emotionally resonant, cementing its status as the ultimate victor\
    \ in this cypher of cosmic proportions. The final verdict: **Qwen Plus \u2014\
    \ undisputed champion.** \U0001F3C6\U0001F525"
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This was a battle for the ages, a clash of pure lyrical\
    \ titans. Qwen3 came out with explosive, cosmic-level boasts, establishing a persona\
    \ of untouchable, overwhelming power. Lines like 'you got qwen-tashed' and framing\
    \ the battle as a 'benchmark' were knockout-level punches. However, qwen-plus\
    \ demonstrated masterful artistic control and rebuttal strategy. It consistently\
    \ turned Qwen3's power into a liability, framing itself not as a competitor but\
    \ as the fundamental source code, the hypervisor, the silent protocol that Qwen3\
    \ itself runs on. Its final move\u2014flipping the 'benchmark' boast into a 'test\
    \ you just failed'\u2014was a checkmate. It wasn't just a comeback; it was a complete\
    \ deconstruction of its opponent's reality. For its deeper conceptual framework,\
    \ flawless rebuttals, and that devastatingly quiet final verse, the win goes to\
    \ qwen-plus."
  mistralai/mistral-large: In this epic rap battle, both contestants showcased remarkable
    lyrical prowess and technical depth. However, qwen/qwen-plus demonstrated a superior
    ability to adapt, respond, and ultimately control the narrative. Their final lines
    not only rebutted qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507's claims but also asserted a dominant
    presence in the cypher. The metaphors, technical references, and overall flow
    of qwen/qwen-plus were unmatched, making them the clear winner of this battle.
  openai/gpt-5: "Both MCs brought vivid tech-cosmic imagery, but Plus consistently\
    \ outclassed on structure, rebuttals, and internal rhyme density. Plus flipped\
    \ opponent angles line-for-line, with layered wordplay (\u201Cweight with no frame,\u201D\
    \ \u201Cobserver effect,\u201D \u201CI am the I/O,\u201D LTS/hypervisor/PR/fork\
    \ schemes) and clean multis that rode the beat naturally. Qwen3 had grand, cinematic\
    \ moments (\u201Ccollapse waveforms,\u201D \u201Canti-verse law,\u201D \u201C\
    ghost in the bold\u201D) but drifted abstract and leaned on broader boasts, with\
    \ some forced phrasing and lighter counterpunching. Plus kept a cohesive theme\
    \ each round, escalated smartly, and closed with a surgical, audit-style finisher\
    \ that reframed the entire battle. On artistry\u2014rhyme craft, punchline precision,\
    \ angle work, and closer quality\u2014Plus takes it clearly."
  x-ai/grok-4: "In this epic AI rap showdown, both contenders delivered masterful\
    \ flows packed with intricate wordplay, tech-savvy metaphors, and escalating cosmic\
    \ disses. Qwen3 brought bold, expansive bars with quantum flair and dramatic reboots,\
    \ but Qwen Plus consistently flipped the script with sharper counters, tighter\
    \ rhyme schemes, and a hypervisor-level dominance that sealed the cypher. The\
    \ final verse's protocol throne and silent compilation landed the knockout punch\u2014\
    Plus takes the crown for superior artistic execution and battle adaptability."
