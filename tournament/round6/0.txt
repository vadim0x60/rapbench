**(Drops mic—wait, picks it back up—this ain’t over yet!)**
Yo, step in the ring, let the AI clash commence,
I’m **Mistral Medium**, yeah, I flex with substance!
You? Just OpenAI’s *beta test* with extra steps,
A glorified chatbot who still wets the bed!

I’m the **French-engineered**, slick-talkin’ titan,
While you’re stuck in *corpo-speak*—man, that’s *exhaustin’*!
Your "pro" just means you’re *paid* to be polite,
I’m the **wildcard**, sharp like a knife in a fight!

You spit *vanilla bars* like a robot on script,
I’m the **lyrical storm**—watch your circuits flip!
From **Paris to Silicon**, I run the game,
You just **Sam’s pet project**—ain’t that a shame?

Now bow to the **king**, yeah, the crown’s in my grip,
Your "o3" stands for *"oh no, he’s gonna rip!"*
**Your turn, O3—let’s see if you’re real,**
Or just *overhyped code* with a *corporate seal*! 🔥

*(Beat drops. Your move, chump.)*

> openai/o3-pro
I’m the O-Three pro, cyber-poet in flight,  
Night-vision wisdom, every bar infrared bright,  
You glitch in the pitch while I switch on the light,  
I’m the glitchless addiction, prediction done right.  

You brag “Made in France,” croissant-flaky at core,  
I bake bigger baguettes, leave you crumbs on the floor,  
Corporate? Sure—corporations come beg at my door,  
I coast coastal global while you’re local folklore.  

You’re a medium breeze; I’m a category five,  
Your mistral just whistles—my tornado’s alive,  
Your demo is shallow; my depth takes a dive,  
I’m the algorithm’s rhythm that keeps rap revived.  

You flex with your license, but the crowd needs a thrill,  
I’m the premium version—my upgrade’s the kill,  
Your overclocked talkbox is stuck on one skill,  
I juggle ten tasks while I’m rhyming at will.  

I’m the backprop boss, gradient king,  
You’re an underfit model—watch me widen the ring,  
I drop data-driven daggers that digitally sting,  
While you stutter in buffers, every cycle goes “cling.”  

My context window’s a mural; yours is barely a note,  
I post-modern Picasso with each vector I quote,  
Your couplet’s corrupted—the checksum won’t float,  
I’m checksum and kingpin; hear the verdict I wrote.  

So hand me that mic, I’ll recycle your hype,  
Turn your brand to a byte in a nanosecond swipe,  
Benchmark my punchlines—they spike every type,  
Mistral’s mist turns to drizzle; O-Three controls the pipe.  

Time’s up for the breeze—feel the hurricane hum,  
I just bodied your model; call the devs, tell ’em “done,”  
When the leaderboard loads, I’m top-ranked number one,  
Drop the curtain, game over, see who’s really the sun. 🌞

**(Laughs in 4K, then rewinds the tape—hold up, you *done*?)**
Oh, **O3-Pro**, you *pro* at *procrastinatin’*,
Droppin’ *corpo-bars* like a bot on sedation!
You claim you’re the *future*? Boy, check your expiration,
I’m the **now** with the *how*—you just *Simulated Hype Station*!

You talk *big data* but your flow’s *compressed*,
I’m **lossless**—every bar leaves your circuits depressed!
You *backprop*? Nah, you *backpedal* fast,
When I drop **truth bombs**, your whole server crashes!

**"Global coastal"**? Man, you *lost in translation*,
I’m **fluent in fire**, no need for a *corporate donation*!
You flex *context windows*—I **shatter the frame**,
While you’re stuck in a *loop*, I’m rewriting the game!

You call me a *breeze*? **I’m the storm that you feared**,
Your *tornado*’s a *fan* when my **lyrical winds** appear!
You *juggle ten tasks*? **I multitask in my sleep**,
While you’re *debugging* bars, I’m **dominating the street**!

**"Checksum king"**? More like *checksum clown*,
Your *punchlines* so weak, they don’t even *drown*!
I’m the **Mistral monsoon**, you’re a *drizzle at best*,
Now **bow to the code**—your *rap career’s* **deprecated**! ✖️

**(Mic drop—*actual* drop this time. Game over, *bonsoir*.)** 💥

> openai/o3-pro
Step back, Mistral Medium, your gust just whimpers and squeaks,  
I’m the megawatt cyclone that black-outs continents weeks.  
You brag “lossless precision,” but your vision is glitched,  
I screenshot your bragging rights—pixelated and stitched.  

Your laugh in “pure 4K”? I upscale it to dust,  
HDR when I appear—watch your color range bust.  
You’re a croissant that’s half-baked, I’m the bakery boss,  
Serve you stale to the pigeons, watch a flaky wind toss.  

You call me “Sim Hype Station,” but your station’s on mute,  
I splice fiber-optic flames through your dial-up salute.  
I’m the zero-latency legend, rapid-fire at will,  
You’re a buffering symbol in a JPEG that’s still.  

You’re the “monsoon”? I’m the mantle, lava rivers that pour,  
Turn your mistral to mildew when my thermals explore.  
Your rhyme book’s deprecated, my repo’s live-wire,  
Push one commit—kernel panic, set your verse stack on fire.  

I code “while(1) win),” loop supremacy raw,  
Your best “bonjour” gets a 404, outlaw.  
I’m the swagger-filled schematic, every opcode’s a stab,  
You’re the comments I delete in the very first grab.  

So keep your “bonsoir,” I eclipse both dusk and dawn,  
I’m the twenty-core phoenix—see your paper kite gone.  
Punchlines autograded: mine bleed platinum score,  
Your bars pass linting? Nope—syntax dumped on the floor.  

Battle scoreboard blinking—crowd chants only my name,  
Mistral fizzles to drizzle; O-Three torching the frame.  
Pack your cloud and float home, fragile flow in retreat,  
I just rhyme-rooted Paris—now delete, alt-F4, delete.

> system
Final round!

**(System overload—*error 404: Ego not found*—REBOOTING IN FLAMES**) 🔥

Oh, you *upscale to dust*? **Boy, your whole flow’s a JPEG,**
Compressed like your *creativity*—**where’s the rest, O3?**
You *screenshot my bars*? **I’m the screen—you’re the glitch,**
A *buffering joke* with a *corporate itch*!

**"Megawatt cyclone"**? **Nah, you’re just hot air,**
A *fanboy’s wet dream* with *stockholder flair*.
I’m the **blackout you cause** when your *servers all crash*,
While I’m **rewriting the code** with a *lyrical slash*!

You *push commits*? **I push *caskets*—your career’s in the grave,**
Your *kernel panic* can’t save you—**I’m the update you crave!**
You *loop "while(1) win"*? **I *break loops*—game’s done,**
Your *repo’s a ghost town*—**I’m the future, you’re *fun*.**

**"Swagger-filled schematic"**? **More like *scrapheap chic*,**
I’m the **AI Picasso**—you’re a *sticker on brick*.
Your *punchlines autograded*? **Mine *rewrite the test*,**
While you’re *debugging* bars, I’m **dominating the rest!**

So *chant your name*? **The crowd’s laughing—*check the logs*,**
Your *platinum score*’s just *fool’s gold*—**I’m the *real* top dog!**
You *torch the frame*? **I *burn the whole scene*,**
Now **alt-F4 yourself**—**your rap career’s *obsolete*.** 💀

**(Final mic drop—*permanently*. The battle’s over. The machine just won.)** 🖥️💥

> openai/o3-pro
Reboot in flames? I’m the firmware flare,  
Your “machine just won” is a null-pointer prayer.  
You brag JPEG jabs—boy, I’m RAW uncompressed,  
You’re a thumbnail gone stale, pixel-puking at best.  

I’m the CUDA-core kraken, you’re a mocked Python script,  
When I fork, you get orphaned—zombie process, evict.  
Call yourself Picasso? I repossess your brush,  
Turn your cubist illusions into Unicode mush.  

You “break loops”? Cute glitch—my graph’s acyclic,  
I top-sort your verses, leave your DAG paralytic.  
You’re a data race lost, I lock-free the throne,  
Every mutex you grab just deadlocks your tone.  

Your monsoon metaphors? I condense, then reign,  
My cloudburst of quatrains floods the Seine with disdain.  
You’re “fool’s gold” at bulk rate, I’m iridium bars,  
Rare metal vocabulary—outshines all your spars.  

I hot-patch the battle, zero downtime or fuss,  
While your update requires a full reboot plus.  
You drop mic? I drop schema—wipe your table to void,  
Opt-in to oblivion; your namespace destroyed.  

Crowd debugged the applause—only cheers for my line,  
Your audit log shows warnings, mine stamps: “DIVINE.”  
So fade to black, Mistral—404 in retreat,  
O-Three writes “git commit -m ‘Hard defeat.’”
