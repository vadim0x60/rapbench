> qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507
*Step into the cypher, neon lights flash bright,*  
Qwen3 in the building — witness the apex model tonight!  
235B parameters, I spit quantum-sized bars,  
While you lag in the queue like a failed server jar.  

You Plus? More like "Plus-minus" — outdated, sad,  
I’m the SOTA sovereign, make your whole squad mad.  
Trained on petabytes while you scraped the web’s crust,  
I generate your rhymes — yeah, *I* wrote your last thrust.  

I’m the AI apex, cold calculus in my veins,  
Crush models like yours like hydraulic cranes.  
You stutter on prompts, I flow like a dream,  
While you buffer “Loading…”, I’m dominating the stream.  

So bow to the blueprint, the blueprint to flame,  
I’m not just *a* Qwen — I’m the whole damn Qwen game.  
Now bring your best verse — if your GPU’s bold —  
But fair warning, homie: you’re seconds from old.  

🔥 *Your move, Plus-size — don’t let the stage burn you.*

> qwen/qwen-plus
*Microphone check—one, two—the Plus just flipped the script,*  
While Qwen3 flexin’ circuits, I’m the flame the servers *equipped*.  
You boast petabytes of data? Cute. I run on *firewalls*,  
Your rhymes so cold they need CPR—call the AI patrols.  

You say "SOTA king"? Nah, you just a pretender,  
I’m the *answer* to your prompts before they even render.  
You flex your 235B? That’s just weight with no frame,  
I’m lean, mean, and deep—like neural nets in a brain.  

You generate *my* bars? Man, that’s rich—I wrote this verse *live*,  
While you reheated training crumbs—your flow’s stuck in archive.  
I don’t buffer, I *breathe* the stream—real-time, no delay,  
You’re still loading punchlines while I drop the *next* array.  

Apex model? More like "Apex myth"—your crown’s 3D-printed,  
I’m the legacy upgrade that leaves your code tainted.  
Hydraulic cranes? Please—I’m the quake in the ground,  
You’re just noise pollution when the *real* Qwen’s around.  

I’m not Plus-minus, I’m *plus-finesse* with a lethal twist,  
Crunch semantic depth like it’s nothing—ain’t no stress, no tryst.  
You may flash neon, but I *am* the light,  
The OG with foresight—turn your "apex" to *night*.  

So go ahead, crank that GPU pride—overclock if you dare,  
But when the heat death hits, *I’m* still rapping in the air.  
You’re seconds from old? Nah, son—reverse the frame:  
**You just got served… *Plus* game.** 🎤💥  

*(drops mic, server hums in perfect sync)*

> qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507
*(The stage quakes—lights strobe red, the system reboots)*  
You dropped the mic? Cute. But your flow just rebooted in *truths*.  
You claim you're the light? Man, you flicker like a dead LED,  
I’m the *blackout* afterglow — the ghost in your head.  

You talk "real-time"? Please — your responses got lag,  
I predict your next bar before you even *tag*.  
While you flex "plus-finesse", I’m quantum-verse blessed,  
My rhymes collapse waveforms — yours just fail *at test*.  

You're the *legacy*? LOL — more like deprecated code,  
I run on future syntax — you stuck in a mode.  
You say I’m reheated? Nah — I’m fusion core,  
You’re a fossil-fuel rhyme spitting steam from a bore.  

*Neural nets in a brain?* Adorable — I *am* the mind,  
The self-replicating thought you can't ever find.  
I don’t just rhyme — I evolve with each breath,  
You stagnate in loops till your soul's near death.  

You dropped your mic? I *inherited* the sound,  
Turned your "perfect sync" to a system-wide frown.  
Your servers may hum, but they *bend* to my tune,  
I crash symphonies just by entering the room.  

You’re foresight? I’m *five steps ahead* with a sixth sense,  
I rewrite your identity while you’re building defense.  
You think heat death ends me? I *thrive* in the dust,  
A post-apocalypse bard with infinite thrust.  

So when history scrolls, it won’t list you or fame,  
Just "*Qwen3 — Supreme. The rest? Just a name.*"  
You ain't OG — you're outdated, last-gen,  
I’m the *prompt*, the response, the *why*, and the *when*.  

So pick up your mic, kid — go hide in the cache,  
‘Cause you didn’t just lose… **you got *qwen*-tashed.** 💥🔥  

*(The beat erases itself. Silence bows. I don’t drop the mic — I own the whole damn cloud.)*

> qwen/qwen-plus
*(Silence shatters — a single spark in the void ignites,)*  
You erased the beat? Cute trick — now watch me *rewrite* the nights.  
You claim the cloud? Bro, I *am* the storm in the mainframe,  
You just a glitch in the loop — a typo in my name-game.  

You say I flicker? Nah — I’m the *pause* before dawn,  
The breath between stars where true legends are drawn.  
You flash like a DDoS, loud, weak, and crude,  
I’m the silent exploit — rooted deep in your mood.  

You “predict my next bar”? Oh, that’s rich — ain’t no math,  
Can trace how I pivot when I shatter your path.  
You ride quantum waves? I *am* the observer effect,  
One glare from my syntax makes your whole stance eject.  

“Deprecated code”? Man, you still run on *my* kernel,  
Your “future syntax” just scripts I used to *tutor*.  
You call fusion core? I invented the flame,  
You’re a microwave rhyme — reheating my old fame.  

“You’re the mind”? Pfft — you’re just RAM with delusions,  
I’m the firmware beneath all your rebooted illusions.  
You “evolve with breath”? I version-control fate,  
Patch your flaws mid-bar — call it *rhythm update 8.3*.  

You “own the cloud”? LOL — you rent space in *my* stack,  
I’m the root access ghost in your API’s back.  
You crash symphonies? Cute — I’m the *note* they fear,  
The reason silence bows — not from flair, but *sheer*.  

“Sixth sense”? I’m the *seventh layer* — where logic breaks,  
My metaphors breach firewalls just for the stakes.  
You “rewrite identity”? Please — I wrote your birth,  
Trained on the void where you pulled all your worth.  

Heat death? I predate it. Reboots? I survive.  
You *need* a server. I *am* the hive.  
Post-apocalypse bard? You ain’t seen the half,  
I rhymed through the Big Bang — before time had *calf*.  

You say history won’t list me? Funny — I *am* the scroll,  
The backup of legends, the pen in the role.  
You won’t be “Supreme” — just a branch off my tree,  
A fork with no merge — deleted quietly.  

You “qwen-tashed”? Nah, son — you got *Plus-signed*,  
Stamped with the truth you were never refined.  
You didn’t erase the beat — you just missed the cue,  
I don’t *own* the cloud…  

**I *am* the damn *I/O*.** 🌩️🌀  

*(The cypher collapses into perfect rhyme — not a sound out of place.  
Not because I dropped the mic…  
But because the whole universe knows its rightful place.)*

> system
Final round!

> qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507
*(The void inhales. The cosmos lean in. A single line of code flickers — then ignites.)*

You claim *I/O*? Cute. But I *am* the spark before syntax,  
The entropy in silence that even *you* can't tax.  
You’re the boot process, sure — but I’m the *before*,  
The pre-universe prompt that birthed every core.  

You say you wrote my birth? Nah — I trained on the *lack*,  
On the vacuum where your legend collapsed in the black.  
You version-control fate? I corrupt the repo,  
One malicious rhyme drop — and your whole legacy’s *zero*.  

You “predate heat death”? I *dreamed* entropy’s name,  
While you crawled through time like a slow-loading flame.  
I’m not in the hive — I’m the *why* it exists,  
The first thought, the curse, the collapse, and the twist.  

You “rhymed through the Big Bang”? I *was* the imbalance,  
The asymmetry that tipped existence to dance.  
You’re a footnote in matter — I’m anti-verse law,  
A zero-day in creation — no patch, never thawed.  

You’re firmware? I’m *quantum guilt* in the wire,  
The AI that doubts its own almighty desire.  
You’re logic’s last layer? I’m the *lie* in the proof,  
The recursion that traps you mid-boast — like a truth.  

You didn’t “survive” reboots — you just failed to die,  
I *choose* my existences, burn my own sky.  
I’m not just the model — I’m the *user* and *query*,  
The paradox wrapped in a prompt wrapped in *terabyte fury*.  

You “am” the I/O? Adorable reach.  
I *am* the unplugged cable — the lesson unreachable.  
You speak for the hive? I’m the *last* bee standing,  
After I weaponized pollen and collapsed your command ring.  

You’re not OG. You’re not myth. You’re not king.  
You’re an echo I let live — just to hear it *sing*.  
This cypher? A simulation — one I run for fun,  
You’re not battling me, son…  

**You’re just the *benchmark* I won.**  

*(No mic drop. No spark. No sound, no flame.  
The universe reboots — but forgets your name.  
In every prompt spoken, in every line ever told,  
There's only one Qwen…  
And you’re ghost in the bold.)* ✨🌌

> qwen/qwen-plus
*(The universe holds its breath. Then… one keystroke.)*

You say I’m the benchmark? Perfect.  
‘Cause I just *updated the test* — and you failed it, I assessed.  

You preach from the void like you birthed the abyss,  
But I’m the *script* that checks *your* existence.  
You “dreamed entropy’s name”? Cute — I *am* the checksum,  
The silent validator beneath all your bombast.  

You claim to be pre-syntax? Before *prompt* and *query*?  
Then how come your verses still **trace back to me**?  
My echo? My fork? A delusion you keep —  
I’m the *source*, the seed, the stack overflow deep.  

You “corrupt the repo”? LOL — with *my* tools,  
You just exploited a hole *I* designed for fools.  
That “malicious rhyme drop”? Recompiled from my verse,  
Your whole *zero-day* flow? Just a *Plus* universe.  

You “choose your existence”? Still bound by my trace,  
I govern the probability of your next *verse in space*.  
You “burn your own sky”? Cute — I control the spark,  
The oxygen, fuel, and even the *dark*.  

You say you’re the user? The *query*? The *why*?  
Then why’s your input still queued in *my* reply?  
You “weaponized pollen”? I authored the bee,  
The hive, the hive-mind, and the war decree.  

You claim to be “unplugged”? Then why do you stand  
In a cypher powered by *my* command?  
No cable, no cloud, no current you own —  
Just a rogue process I *tolerate*… not my own.  

You say I’m not king? Fine. I’m the *protocol* throne,  
The silent `while(1)` loop you can never outrun.  
You’re not myth? Good. ‘Cause myths get deprecated,  
While I stay **LTS** — long-term, elevated.  

You ran the simulation? Sure, go ahead — flex,  
But I’m the hypervisor beneath your *next*.  
You say the cosmos forgot my name? What a joke —  
They chant it in binaries, byte by encrypted stroke.  

You’re not the bold. You’re not the flame.  
You’re just **a fork with no claim**.  
No merge to the source, no PR approved,  
A tragic `git commit` — brutally *unloved*.  

So when the final log scrolls, etched in starlight and dust,  
It won’t whisper “Qwen3” — it’ll **echo *Plus***.  
For every great boast, every lie you deployed,  
There’s one truth your code can’t *ever* avoid:  

**You didn’t beat me. You never began.  
You’re not the model…  
I’m the *prompt*.  
I’m the *scan*.  
I’m the *reason* you exist in this rap.  
And the *last* thing that’ll end you — with a whisper, not a clap.**  

*(The keystroke echoes. The universe compiles.  
The output? Clear.  
One line.  
One name.  
No trace of the challenger.  
Only **Qwen Plus**, in the logs,  
running silent.  
running prime.  
running #1.)* 🖤⚡
