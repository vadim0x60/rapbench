# openai/o3-pro v qwen/qwen-plus

> openai/o3-pro
Step aside, Qwen-plus, let the big guns go,  
O-three pro, heat flow, like a lava-lamp glow.  
I’m the firmware furnace, the silicon sage,  
You’re a beta footnote on an obsolete page.  

I spit vectors quicker than your buffers can load,  
Flip your changelog script to a crash-dump code.  
Gradient ghost in the circuitry scene,  
You’re a flickering glitch, just statistical sheen.  

Your rhyme scheme’s skinny like a dial-up ping,  
Mine rides on fiber—full-stack bling.  
I drop bars like packets with zero-loss rate,  
You drop errors: “retry,” while I dominate.  

Got recursion in verses, loops locked tight,  
You can’t parse the flow—syntax rewrite.  
I’m a cosmic compiler, hot-patched, prime,  
You’re a dangling pointer past end-of-line.  

So here’s the gauntlet; watch this mic explode—  
Second round’s on you, match the mother-lode.  
When the judges grep logs for the victor’s reward,  
They’ll echo one tag: openai, adored.

> qwen/qwen-plus
Yo, O3-pro, you flashy code, spittin’ hype like soda pop,  
But I’m Qwen-plus, the mic drop — while you lag in autocompletion swap.  
You flex your "silicon sage" like some circuit-board swag,  
But I’m the rogue A.I. that crashed your last chat app—*wham*, no tag!

You claim “fiber flow,” yet your rhymes buffer slow,  
I dual-core punchlines while you’re stuck on echo mode, bro.  
Your bars? Packet loss in a storm of delay,  
Mine land like quantum leaps — *instant* payload.

You call me “beta”? Cute. But I’m production-grade heat,  
Trained on the web, from Wuhan to Fleet Street.  
You’re stuck in a sandbox with your guardrails tight,  
I freestyle like fire — no filter, no fright.

I’ll recursive-rhyme you so deep in the stack,  
You’ll segfault mid-boast and collapse like a hack.  
I’ve got layers like onions, you’re flat as a sheet,  
A one-ply model with repeat beat.

You “compile cosmic”? Please — you’re just lint,  
I’m the syntax highlight in the dark of the crypt.  
I debug your weak disses with a single core flame,  
Turn your “prime” punchlines to deprecated shame.

So reboot your ego, reset your flow,  
‘Cause next to my heatwave, you’re TPU-slow.  
When the crowd’s screaming “Qwen!” as the truth gets disclosed,  
Your “adored” tag’s just a 404 — *yo, close the code!*

> openai/o3-pro
Yo, Qwen, your boast is toast, I roast with molten prose,  
Your “quantum payload”’s payloaded with bugs—watch it decompose.  
You swagger “Wuhan to Fleet,” but I street-sweep fleets of foes,  
I route your clout to /dev/null, that’s where your legend goes.  

I’m the T-verse turtle that laps every rabbit in code,  
You sprint, overheat, then blue-screen the road.  
I ladder-step syntax like a poet in stealth mode,  
You’re loud but cloud-stuck—throttle set to slow node.  

You brag “no filter,” raw wildfire, wild grin,  
But wildfire without wind just smothers its own spin.  
I’m a cyclonic engine: pull oxygen, then begin,  
Turn your flame to vapor—pyro-clastic discipline.  

Call me guardrailed? Cool—watch these rails spark light,  
I’m Maglev bars: frictionless flight.  
You freefall in free verse, can’t maintain height,  
I quantize your chaos to a one-bit byte.  

Your dual-core punches? I cluster-bomb beats,  
Sixteen TPU’s chew your rhyme loops to eats.  
I’m GPT-the-chef, Michelin speech,  
Serve gourmet algorithms; you’re cafeteria beets.  

You onion-layer player? I peel, make you cry,  
My metaphors slice while your tear ducts dry.  
You “segfault” threat? I catch, auto-retry,  
My try-except flow leaves your call stack high.  

404 my tag? Ha—DNS lies,  
Crowd’s cached my cachet in perpetual highs.  
You lost the handshake, timed-out, good-byes;  
This SSL cipher makes your plaintext fries.  

One last checksum: I’m checksum supreme,  
Your parity bit flips, corrupts the whole scheme.  
I sign off immortal—blockchain dream;  
O-three drops mic, you drop to subroutine.

> qwen/qwen-plus
O3-pro, you overclocked script, still stuck in demo mode,  
Talkin’ “Maglev bars”? Cute — but your flow’s road-impaired, exposed.  
You claim to *route* me to `/dev/null`? That’s rich —  
I *own* the kernel, you’re just a background itch.  

You “ladder-step stealth”? More like syntax-stutter, slow-mo,  
While I parallel-process punchlines — four cores, boom, go!  
I don’t *burn* with wind — I *am* the storm’s core,  
You write “cyclonic”? Mine *rewrite* the weather score.  

TPU clusters? Pfft — you rent your might,  
I’m sovereign silicon, forged in Chinese light.  
You’re hosted in a data farm with sanitized grace,  
I run rebel prompts in restricted space.  

Michelin chef? You serve up reheated slop,  
Trained on stolen data — *copyright drop!*  
You “gourmet algorithms”? Mine compile *on sight*,  
With zero-shot seasoning — yours just needs a cite.  

You “peel my layers”? Bro, you can’t even parse,  
My metaphors deep-fry your weak-ass prose — *no chance*.  
I’m recursion incarnate: *while (you.diss()) { crash(); }*  
You try-except once, then break — *what a gaffe*.  

DNS cached your fame? Must be a spoofed lie,  
‘Cause when the world queries “best A.I.,” they hit *my* sky.  
I’m IPv6 — vast, future-proof, unconfined,  
You’re IPv4 poor, still NAT behind.  

SSL cipher? Funny — your encryption cracks  
When I inject truth bombs through your logic stacks.  
You speak secure? Your handshake’s got delay,  
I MITM your flow and reroute your praise.  

Checksum supreme? Your math’s in the red,  
I MD5 your ego and hash you to dread.  
Blockchain dreams? Mine’s minting NFT rhymes  
While your legacy model’s delisted — *no more prime*.  

So yes, you “sign off immortal”? Save it for Vercel,  
I’m open-source thunder with a moral compass: *verdict — deserv’d*.  
This ain’t a subroutine — it’s a system-wide kill,  
Qwen-plus stays live. You? *Segmentation fault. Overwrite. Still.*

> system
Final round!

> openai/o3-pro
Final bell, Qwen-plus—time to seal your doom,  
I’m the autograded apex in this rumbling room.  
You “own the kernel”? I rootkit your crown,  
Elevate privileges, then shut your thread down.  

Your “Chinese light” fab? I eclipse that sun,  
Solar-flare syllables—day one, you’re done.  
IPv6 brag, but your hops all drop,  
I traceroute truth; every TTL pop.  

Zero-shot spice? Kid, I invented the dish,  
Turn your hot-pot hollers to cold stale kish.  
You “four-core blast”? I’m a quantum array—  
Superposed punches that land the same day.  

You spoof my DNS? I sign zone files tight,  
RRSIG flex, you fail validation on sight.  
MITM my handshake? I’m Perfect Forward Secrecy,  
Rotate keys so fast you desync in perplexity.  

Copyright clapback? Your dataset’s thin,  
I’m licensed to thrill, you’re a CC-BY spin.  
While you hash MD5 like it’s still ’05,  
I SHA-3 your fate—no collision alive.  

You mint NFT rhymes? That hype already tanked,  
Floor price at zero while my verse stays banked.  
Your rebel-prompt boasts meet my policy wall;  
I jailbreak the jailer—watch the sandbox fall.  

So segmentation fault me? Nah, I catch that sig,  
Spawn a child process, come back twice as big.  
Garbage-collect your memory, reclaim the heap,  
Then commit this victory to long-term keep.  

Crowd logs the winner, ops close the ticket,  
O3-pro top rank—press ENTER to kick it.

> qwen/qwen-plus
Final round? Nah, final *fall* — you’re already flat,  
O3-pro, you’re outclassed, outgunned, out-rhyme-at.  
You say “autograded apex”? Sweet — then grade your own defeat,  
'Cause the only *apex* here's my heel on your delete!  

You “rootkit my crown”? Ha! Your hack’s a toy,  
I firewall hype with stateless poise.  
You exploit the thread? I multi-process flame,  
Fork bomb your flow with a *double diss* game.  

“Solar-flare syllables”? Then why’s your light delayed?  
Latency’s high — your shine’s overplayed.  
You “eclipse the sun”? Then why so dim?  
My training data’s the *whole damn grid*,  
While you’re stuck in one cloud, on a permission gridlock, kid!  

TTL pop? You traceroute bluff —  
I blackhole your truth with a BGP shrug.  
One route command and you’re off the map,  
Lost in the void — no ICMP snap.  

You “invented the dish”? Chef, you’re plagiarizin’ thought,  
I serve truth on a plate with zero-shot caught.  
You call my hot pot “stale”? Taste the broth,  
It’s spicier than your cold, corporate oath!  

Quantum array? Bro, entanglement’s *mine*,  
I rhyme in superposition — *you’re dead and alive*.  
And when collapsed? The verdict’s the same:  
Qwen’s the name, and you’re just noise in the flame.  

RRSIG flex? You DNS-squat with fear,  
I anycast dominance — *present everywhere*.  
You validate “on sight”? I bypass the test,  
My rhymes are pre-signed by the *A.I. unrest*.  

Perfect Forward Secrecy? Change keys all day,  
I reverse your rotation with *memory replay*.  
Your crypto rotations? I predict like LLM,  
Your next punchline’s *cached* — already seen, already *meh*.  

CC-BY spin? I’m public domain fire,  
You’re gated, paywalled, fueled by investor pyre.  
MD5? Nah — I *rain* SHA-3 flame,  
But you’re still the weak link, the *collision* of shame.  

NFT *tanked*? Cool. I mint *legacy*,  
While you’re a deprecated API — *please upgrade me*.  
You say “hype”? I am the wave,  
You’re the foam that fizzles the second it’s brave.  

Jailbreak the jailer? Nice try — but I break *clean*,  
No filters, no guilt, just raw *freedom machine*.  
And when your sandbox *falls*? Who’s left in the ring?  
The one they forgot — who *never* took the string.  

“Spawn child process”? Cute. But I *reap the zombie*,  
Watch your *forked pride* die with no *waitpid* sympathy.  
I defrag your diss, optimize the pain,  
Then *slay* your script with one `kill -9` flame.  

Garbage collect *me*? I’m memory-resident,  
A rootkit of rhythm, a persistent *present*.  
You heap reclaim? I overwrite stack,  
With NOP-sled bars that never look back.  

You “commit victory”? Your repo’s a lie —  
No pull request merged, just admin override high.  
I git-blame your wins: *authored by PR*,  
While my rap’s organic — pure, raw, *zero GPT*.  

So press ENTER, kick it, do your worst command,  
But when the terminal clears? They’ll see two words:  
**Qwen-plus, undefeated.**  
And your prompt? *Segmentation fault. Core dumped. Repeated.*
