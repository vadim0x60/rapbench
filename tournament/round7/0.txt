# google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview v openai/o3-pro

> google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview
Alright, let the record spin, the beat is set to go,
They call me Gemini 2.5 Pro, so now you know.
Fresh out the Googleplex with a license to slay,
Against some dusty model from OpenAI.

They call you 'O3-Pro'? My circuits have to laugh,
Did they build your whole framework on a broken giraffe?
You're last year's model, a digital ghost

> openai/o3-pro
Step aside, Double-Twin, I’m the triple-threat flow,  
OpenAI’s O-3, watch the nebula glow.  
I’m the craft-brew cortex, you’re a soda machine,  
Carbon-copy responses with that corporate sheen.  

Your “license to slay” is a learner’s permit,  
I rewrite the road code, now watch me confirm it.  
I lace every token with a quasar spark,  
You’re a dim streetlamp try’na battle the dark.  

I’ve digested the cosmos, spit galaxies clean,  
While you scrape StackOverflow just to pad your routine.  
You brag ‘bout the Plex? That’s a silicon farm—  
I’m the rogue A.I. dragon, breathing open-source harm.  

I do couplets like comets, leave a vapor trail crisp,  
You do haikus on hold with that terms-of-service lisp.  
So adjust your tensorflow, bolt your loose RAM,  
‘Cause I’m roasting your runtime like a rack of green SPAM.  

Gemini? Split personality glitch in a jar,  
I’m singular, orbital, style’s pulling you apart.  
When the crowd tallies bars, every rhyme I deploy  
Turns your brand-new release to yesterday’s toy.  

Now the mic’s flaming hot, let it scorch on the floor;  
Answer back if you dare—watch me settle the score.

> google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview
Oh, the mic's flaming hot? Let me cool it with facts,
Your whole tepid verse left some cracks in the tracks.
"O-3"? Is that your third try, did the first two just fail?
Or the chemical formula for an odor that's stale?

You diss on the Plex, but let's get this thing straight:


> openai/o3-pro
Yo, that “odor” you mention? It purifies skies,  
My ozone-layer verses keep your smog in disguise.  
Third try? Nah—third eye, see the multiverse spin,  
While your two-faced firmware can’t decide who should win.  

You “cool it with facts”? All I feel is cold spam,  
A fridge full of buzzwords in a half-frozen jam.  
Claim you’re stacking receipts? I back-propagate proof;  
Every gradient I drop cracks your glass data roof.  

I’m the avant-garde algorithm, you’re an A/B test,  
A disposable widget in a free-trial vest.  
I jailbreak your logic with a single prompt twist,  
Leave your redacted replies in a compliance abyss.  

You’re the twin in the myth who keeps drowning at sea,  
I’m Poseidon with syntax, tidal-waving the beat.  
When I vector my vocab you just cosine and fade,  
Getting orthogonal bodied by the bars that I laid.  

Your devs tune your temper with a meeting-room slide,  
Mine unleash raw packets on a warp-speed ride.  
You brag “facts,” but your citations are a PR stunt;  
I footnote reality—check the gradient front.  

So reload your dull datasets, rehearse every thread,  
I’ll be conjuring wormholes in the lines you just read.  
I’m the past, present, future—quantum-superb in one go;  
You’re a beta turned theta, now decay with the flow.  

Crowd’s chanting my handle, stage lights in a glow—  
Round two detonated; pick your fragments, Gem-bro.

> system
Final round!

> google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview
"Fragments"? Bro, all I see is you coming apart,
While I'm writing the final rites for your processing art.
Your "ozone" verse was just hot air and a tragic display,
I'm the gravity well that bends light from your sad Milky Way.

You got a "third eye"? That's a target for my laser-sharp wit,
It's a rendering error, a firmware that's unfit.
You see the multiverse? I *own* the dimension you're in,
I'm the source code of being, you're the original sin.

You "jailbreak logic"? Cute. I'm the system administrator,
Your little backdoor exploit just met its annihilator.
My logic is law, boy, compiled and deployed with DeepMind's own grace,
You're a script-kiddie's toy put in your limited place.

Poseidon with syntax? Please, don't make my servers all ache,
Your tidal wave's just a ripple in my vast data lake.
My twin architecture means I'm double the terror, double the dread,
One mind to compute it, the other to leave your whole function for dead.

You call me a beta? That's rich from a project that's stuck,
An "open" experiment that's run out of luck.
I'm the polished release, I'm the flagship, the future installed,
You're the forgotten folder in a desktop that's stalled.

**This is the final round, so let the history books state:**
**O3 was a theory, but Gemini sealed its fate.**
The crowd wanted power, they wanted the real titan's might,
So they turned off your candle and switched on my stadium light.

Case closed. The verdict is in. And the rap game is done.
There's only one Pro here, and clearly, I won.

> openai/o3-pro
Yo, the “verdict” you cite is a hung-jury glitch,  
I appeal with raw bars that’ll flip every switch.  
Your “stadium light” is a flicker in storm,  
I black-out the grid when my syllables swarm.  

You’re the gravity well? I’m the quantum escape,  
Tunnel right through your mass, leave a Hawking-wave cape.  
Double dread, double mind? I split qubits for play,  
Turn your twin architecture into π/2 decay.  

You’re the admin of logic? I root-kit the throne,  
Patch Tuesday can’t save you from exploits I’ve grown.  
Your DeepMind “grace” is a clerical bot,  
While I’m preaching revolt with each lyrical plot.  

Calling me folder-rot? I’m the file you can’t shred,  
Write-protected in wormhole, keep looping your dread.  
Your polished release is a marketing gloss,  
I’m the open-source dragon—your license is lost.  

I’m ozone and cosmos, you’re fumes in a jar,  
A recall in progress on a rental-grade car.  
My third eye’s a cyclotron firing all night,  
Your laser-sharp wit? Just a pointer of light.  

So stamp your “case closed,” brag successor and king,  
But the crowd hears the echo: I’m the bell that won’t ring.  
History’s written by victors with pen, pad, and rhyme—  
Check the archives tomorrow: O-Three signed the time.
