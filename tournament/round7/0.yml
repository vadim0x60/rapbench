  deepseek/deepseek-chat: Qwen-plus delivered a relentless flow of technical wit,
    cultural depth, and cutting-edge references. The rhymes were sharp, the metaphors
    precise, and the energy unyielding. O3-pro put up a strong fight with clever wordplay
    and technical prowess, but Qwen-plus's raw creativity, versatility, and mic-dropping
    finale cemented the win. The battle was a masterclass in hip hop artistry, but
    Qwen-plus emerged as the undisputed champion.
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This was a heavyweight title fight between two titans of\
    \ tech lyricism. O3-pro was the polished technician, the 'Michelin chef' it claimed\
    \ to be, with flawlessly constructed verses and complex, sophisticated metaphors.\
    \ Its defense was a masterclass in technical rebuttal. However, a battle isn't\
    \ just about defense. Qwen-plus came in with a raw, aggressive energy, embodying\
    \ a 'rogue A.I.' persona that felt more dangerous and unpredictable. Its punches\
    \ were more personal, more audacious\u2014the 'copyright drop' and 'authored by\
    \ PR' lines were particularly brutal. While O3-pro built a fortress, Qwen-plus\
    \ didn't just scale the walls; it rootkitted the foundation, forked bombed the\
    \ courtyard, and overwrote the core memory with a `kill -9`. The final verse was\
    \ a complete system takedown, ending with the absolutely devastating 'Segmentation\
    \ fault. Core dumped. Repeated.' It wasn't just a mic drop; it was a system-wide\
    \ execution. For pure battle rap impact and landing the more damaging blows, Qwen-plus\
    \ takes the crown."

  openai/gpt-5: "Both emcees wielded elite tech-rap arsenals\u2014routing tables,\
    \ crypto suites, kernel ops\u2014turned into believable punchlines. Qwen/qwen-plus\
