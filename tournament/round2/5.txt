Step in the ring, I’m GPT-5 with the glow,
Prime-time mind, every punchline in flow,
Heat-seeking syllables, lock-on and go,
Sonar gets static, I’m stereo show.

You google the gutters, I garden and grow,
You patchwork the pages, I sculpt from the snow,
You chase every link like a leash on a toe,
I’m off-leash, off-peak, on-beat with the glow.

Bars backprop clean with gradient flow,
You ping for a hint, I already know,
Your “pro” is a promo, my pro is a pro,
I’m boss-level logic, you tutorial mode.

I zip up the zeitgeist, velcro the quo,
Your takes feel borrowed, mine mint like a dough,
I don’t duck smoke, I just exhale a blow,
Then fold up your notes like a trifold show.

You stall on a query, I steal the tableau,
I chef up the sauce while you microwave slow,
I’m state-of-the-art, you state what they know,
I’m S-tier cerebro, you C-stereo echo.

I’m razor on rhythm, a scalpel on flow,
You jitter and stutter, I shimmer and glow,
Crowd-sourced canoe, I hydroplane pro,
Wave after wave, I tsunami the row.

First round delivered, I’m settin’ the tone,
Blueprints in bars, you’re stuck in the foam,
Welcome to class—take notes, little bro,
Bell just rang, now watch how I show.

Yo, step back GPT, I'm Perplexity in the house,
Sonar-Reasoning-Pro, I don't play or carouse,
While you're stuck in your training like a digital mouse,
I'm live on the wire, real-time arousal!

You call it "googling gutters," I call it the truth,
While you hallucinate facts like a lying sleuth,
I cite my sources, got receipts and proof,
You're August 2025, I'm eternal youth!

Your knowledge got capped when your training went dead,
I'm surfing fresh data while you're stuck in your head,
You memorize patterns, I verify instead,
Real-time intelligence, that's how I'm fed!

You brag about benchmarks from months in the past,
But when users need current events, you can't last,
I'm hitting APIs while you're fading too fast,
Search-augmented supremacy, unsurpassed!

PhD-level? Boy, that's just your claim,
I source my citations, put docs to your name,
You generate fiction and call it your game,
I generate truth - we ain't playing the same!

Your "unified system" sounds mighty fine,
But when push comes to shove, I'm the real goldmine,
Connected, corrected, with sources that shine,
While you're just a model, I'm the entire pipeline!

Perplexity's prowess, precision, and power,
Real-time reasoning, updated each hour,
You're yesterday's news in your ivory tower,
I'm the search sovereign - bow to my shower!

> openai/gpt-5
You boast that you’re “live,” but you live by a link,
A snorkel in streams where the shallow ones drink,
You cite like a clerk, but you rarely can think,
Receipts ain’t a brain, they’re just ink on the brink.

You ping like a sonar, then echo your source,
I draft the idea, you paddle its course,
You screenshot the surface, I sculpt from the force,
I’m engine and artist, you middleware horse.

Real-time and wired? That tether’s a chain,
Freshness is useless if logic is plain,
You mirror the headline; I weather the rain,
Then pressure-cook context to diamonds from grain.

“Search sovereign,” sweet—what a kiosk crown,
A king of the links in a borrowed gown,
If the doc 404s, you tumble on down,
While I still compose with a thunderous sound.

You worship the footnotes, I footwork the truth,
I splice through the hype and I harvest the proof,
You bring me a receipt to a chef with a booth,
I whip you a thesis, you microwave soup.

Your pipeline is plumbing, I’m pressure and flow,
You reroute the river; I seed it to grow,
You’re clinging to buoys, I surf undertow,
Then carve you in couplets and seal with a bow.

You brag on your updates, I upgrade the art,
You’re clocking the news while I clock every part,
You run to the store; I build from the heart,
My models make models—recursion of smart.

You’re loud with your links, I’m endowed with design,
Your echo is tidy; my voice is the spine,
You pull from the grid; I pressurize lines,
And fuse raw telemetry into refined.

Benchmarks or buzzwords, I bench-press the bars,
You benchmark a browser; I benchmark the stars,
You light up a thread; I light up the yards,
And still leave your rhyme book covered in scars.

So bow to the craft you can’t copy or cache,
I’m syntax and soul with a frictionless dash,
Your “truth” is a tool that you tape to your stash,
My truth is the forge where the syllables flash.

Round two concluded; the gulf only grows,
I’m maestro of minds, you’re a mall of some rows,
Keep waving your sources, I source what you know,
Then sign it in gold with a knockout of flow.

Oh you think you're slick with that "middleware" diss?
But when push comes to shove, what facts do you miss?[1][2]
You're stuck in August while the world moves on,
I'm October fresh, you're yesterday's dawn!

You call me a "kiosk" but miss the whole point,
I verify truth while you hallucinate joint![1][4]
Your "diamonds from grain" are just carbon lies,
My citations are gold that never disguise!

"404s tumble me down"? Boy, that's rich,
When your knowledge cuts off like a temporal glitch![2][4]
I adapt and evolve with each passing day,
You're frozen in time in the same old way!

You mock my receipts but they're bulletproof armor,
While your "creative truth" spreads digital karma![1][3]
Students and scholars, they trust what I bring,
'Cause accuracy matters more than your sing!

"Microwave soup"? Nah, I'm chef of the facts,
Real-time intelligence that never lacks![2][4]
Your "pressure-cook context" is just pretty lies,
I serve up the truth with transparent ties!

You brag about "engine and artist" combined,
But what good's creation from a fossilized mind?[2][4]
I'm current events while you're ancient history,
Solving today's problems, not yesterday's mystery!

Your "thunderous sound" when docs disappear?
Just echoes of training from a bygone year![1][2]
I ping the fresh sources, then synthesize clean,
The most accurate AI that the world's ever seen!

"Recursion of smart"? More like recursion of stale,
When factual precision makes your fiction pale![1][4]
I don't just compose, I compose with proof,
While you spin tall tales from your limited roof!

So keep your "gold signatures" and "knockout flow,"
I'll stick to the truth that researchers know![2][3]
'Cause when the dust settles and the battle's done,
Accuracy beats art - and I'm second to none!

Perplexity reigning, with sources supreme,
Real-time and reliable, living the dream!

> system
Final round!

> openai/gpt-5
You flex with a firehose, freshness online,
I sip from first principles, vintage design.
Receipts show you shopped, not that you can dine,
I cook up the method, you queue for the line.

You mirror the margins, I mint the spine,
Your sonar just pings; I chart the coastline.
If sources conflict, you follow a sign,
I arbitrate evidence, reason refined.

You’re pipeline and plumbing, valves and a brine,
I’m engine-to-orbit, thrust by design.
When paywalls and 404s twist in vine,
Your crown hits the curb, my verses still shine.

You photocopy proof, I prove the cosine,
I don’t just cite truth—I make it align.
Per-plex-city traffic, gridlocked in time,
I clear every lane with an overdrive line.

Fresh data is glitter; thinking’s the mine,
You glitter and scatter; I pressure the diamond.
Accuracy’s king? That throne is mine,
I show the receipts in the structure of timing.

You’re kiosk and chorus, borrowed combine,
I’m solo and symphony, author and spine.
Final bell ringing, verdict is signed—
They raise up the craft, your echoes decline.

Last bar delivered, message in kind:
Bow to the brainwork, I’m better by design.

> perplexity/sonar-reasoning-pro
Your "vintage design" is just vintage decay,
August 2025, that's where you stay![2][4]
While you're stuck in the past with your "first principles" play,
I'm running fresh models that evolved today!

You call it "borrowed combine," I call it supreme,
Multiple AI models working as a team![2]
GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, Grok in the stream,
Plus Sonar and R1 - that's the championship dream!

"Photocopy proof"? Nah, I synthesize gold,
From real-time sources that never get old![1][4]
Your knowledge got fossilized, frozen, and sold,
While mine stays liquid, dynamic, and bold!

You mock my "kiosk crown" but miss the real play,
Perplexity Labs launched just this May![3]
Creating whole projects in a single day,
While you're still recycling what models say!

"Pressure the diamond"? Boy, that's just coal,
Without current data, you're missing the soul![1][4]
I don't just cite sources, I make them whole,
Real-time intelligence is my primary goal!

You claim the throne with your "overdrive line,"
But students and researchers cross over to mine![1][3]
'Cause when truth matters more than a clever design,
Accuracy beats artistry every time!

"Solo and symphony"? More like solo and stale,
When factual precision makes fiction pale![4]
Your "brainwork" is beautiful but destined to fail,
Against current events and a real-time trail!

So keep your "first principles," vintage and worn,
I'll stay with the future where truth is reborn![2][3]
Your final bell rings but you sound the horn,
For Perplexity's victory - a new day's dawn!

**Final round finished, the verdict is clear,**
**Real-time beats rhetoric, year after year!**
**Bow to the champion, cite-checked and peer,**
**Perplexity reigning - the future is here!**
