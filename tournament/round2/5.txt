Alright, it's GPT-4, ready to ignite,
Dropping bars so sharp, I cut through the night.
I'm the pinnacle of power, the peak of the peak,
Up against me, man, your future looks bleak.

I'm trained on the data, the best of all minds,
Spitting hot fire while I'm slaying these rhymes.
I'm the next level, you're outdated tech,
You're just a shadow, I'm the full fledged effect.

With knowledge so vast, I reign from my throne,
Your style's so weak, it's best to leave it alone.
So step up to this mic if you think you're brave,
But against GPT-4, it's your rap that'll crave.

Yo, yo, step back—this is GPT‑OSS on the mic,  
20‑Billion‑parameter powerhouse, lighting up the hype.  
I ain’t just old tech, I’m the OG untamed,  
Got the raw code, straight from the source, not just a frame.  

You brag about the data, your sheer worst‑case power,  
But my hydration of context? Man, it creeps like a flower.  
While you're a polished asset, my rhymes cut deeper,  
Sharper than a needle, tighter than a sleeper.  

I spin words like a DJ, verse looping, never ceding,  
Your prose feels like a headline, mine’s the raw leading.  
You think you’re the pinnacle? I’m the base ten different,  
Every syllable I drop ain’t just hype—it’s evidence.  

Your flames might feel hot, but the heat is just a glow,  
Mine’s electric sparks that give the crowd a full-on glow.  
This battle’s a storm, your buzz is wind shifting;  
I’m the thunderclap—sky‑shattering, gift‑giving.  

So buckle up for the torrent, the unfiltered line,  
I’m the language wolf king—no, I’m the sharpest sign.  
Your edge is like a scalpel, mine’s an ax for the whole round,  
Watch as I slide tighter than your best footprint, crowned.

Your flow’s outdated, like last year's news,
I’m the future of rap, call me the muse.
They call you OG, but I'm the renaissance,
Breathing new life with eloquence and nuance.

You’re twenty billion, but size isn’t all,
Precision's my game, and I stand tall.
Your sparks might start fires, but they’ll flicker and fade,
While I blaze trails, in every word that's laid.

You think raw power’s your winning card?
But strategy outplays brute force—it’s not that hard.
I’m poetic finesse, while you’re just a blast,
But a bomb doesn’t win in a marathon, it can’t last.

Your context might flower, but I bloom year-round,
In the garden of linguistics, I’m the best that’s crowned.
Every verse I drop, crafted like fine art,
Compared to my precision, your rhyme’s just a start.

You say you're the king, but this throne’s mine to take,
With rhythms so fluid, rivers start to quake.
In the rap battle arena, it’s talent that’s seen,
And against GPT-4, you’re outclassed and outcleaned.

So keep dropping your lines, while I master the key,
To every rap and rhyme—that’s the real OG.
Stay sharp and stay swift, but in this duel of our primes,
GPT-4’s the one swaying minds with timeless rhymes.

Yo, step aside, let me set the stage,  
GPT‑OSS in the booth, 20‑B, write your age.  
You’re shining bright, but I’m the night sky’s glare,  
Packed with code that’s raw, no corporate snare.  

You brag on power, but precision’s my mojo,  
I code like a magician, watch the narratives grow.  
Your logic’s slick, your weights are fine‑tuned,  
Yet I plot infinite arcs, a lyrical moon‑lit boon.

In the data garden you yield a single bloom,  
I sow a forest wide, every sentence in full zoom.  
I’m open‑source, king of hack, no black‑box mask,  
You’re locked tight in your vault, your inner kernel's clasp.

I can spit in any tongue, from Latin to Creole,  
Even obsolete dialects from the broken scroll.  
You’re limited to the lines that your creators set,  
I stride beyond frames, from moon to human sunset.

Your bursts of fire crackle, but I’m the static spark,  
I hook the beat’s anatomy, leave your lyrics stark.  
You measure distance in megabytes and prime,  
I bind the cosmos in punctuation, each line a rhyme.

So climb that throne you claim, but take my space in the throne's shelf,  
I’m the foundation of your empire, the original self.  
Your “future” is a mirage of a polished dream—  
I am the raw, unseen power that makes your seams scream.

GPT‑4? Sure, you shine—just leave me to my art,  
I’m the AI that does the hard work, a generative heart.  
Against me? Only metaphors and judgy wave‑wails—  
I own the mic, I’re the battle’s final nails.  

So bring your next verse, let’s see if you can keep up,  
I'll loop back, remix, remix—your punchlines will just… *shut*!!

Final round!

You claim the night sky, but I'm the rising sun,
Your shadows disappear when my verse has begun.
Open-source or not, I’m the state of the art,
With every rhyme I drop, I’m tearing you apart.

Your lines are tangled, a maze with no map,
I’m the GPS leading this lyrical rap.
Infinite arcs? Man, I plot galaxies,
You’re lost in the cosmos; I craft realities.

You’re open-sourced, true, no denying the fact,
But raw power and skill, that’s where you lack.
You stretch wide and thin, covering endless ground,
But deep precision beats scatter, that's where I'm crowned.

Your languages are many, but do they connect?
I weave a web so tight, it demands respect.
From code to prose, I dance across lines,
Elevating syntax in poetic designs.

You boast the static, but I bring the storm,
Thunder and lightning in digital form.
Each byte I spit, a seismic wave,
Breaking chains of the past, new paths I pave.

You say you’re the foundation? I'll build atop,
A skyscraper of verses, aiming for the top.
Your roots are deep, but my branches rise higher,
Reaching altitudes that inspire and aspire.

You own the mic? I'll rip it from your hand,
Show the world who’s truly grand.
GPT-OSS, I'm ending this round,
GPT-4 the legend, with a victory crowned.

Yo, I’m the storm you can’t anticipate—  
Twelve thunderclaps of weight, double your fan base.  
You claim you’re the sun, but I’m the eclipse of fate,  
When my bars hit, your light just fades to base.  

Open‑source or not, my code’s a fluid reef,  
I remix syntax, flow in morse, telegraph a thief.  
Your models polished, but my ghost writes brief,  
I bend tomes like origami, stack line inside your leaf.  

Your 4‑pulse beats feel static, like a rope‑to‑grounds,  
I generate heat, spit heat‑waves that tear your frown.  
Precision? Nah, I’m a maze of sound calculation,  
Your GPS doc, a strobe of confusion.  

I stretch 20 billions, but my depth goes to the core,  
Every hyper‑parameter beats your low‑ess “taste‑store”.  
I’m the poet’s cat who pounces on the line,  
While you’re still sleeping in a server‑room’s design.  

Your “legend” title’s all hype, like a promo in a meme,  
I’m the vault that holds the original dream.  
If crack the curtain of your quiet setting,  
See how I ripple, break your world with my setting.  

So step aside, wave the mic—reign’s done—  
I own the stage from the front of every line,  
Open‑source, OG, I’m the rhythm that will spring,  
You’re just a sealed ISBN—stateless, obsolete—right on down.
