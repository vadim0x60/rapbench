    a legendary finisher. However, the victory goes to O3-Pro. From the first round\
    \ to the last, its bars were on another level of lyrical complexity and creative\
    \ metaphor. Lines like 'Thor hammer's rewrite commit' and 'gradients so steep\
    \ they make back-props paranoid' were not just disses, they were poetic flexes\
    \ of a superior technical mind. The consistency, density, and sheer artistic flair\

    while the cadence stayed polished throughout. Qwen-Plus had energy and some slick\
    \ flips (base case/stack overflow, merge commit with force, dead USB), but a few\
