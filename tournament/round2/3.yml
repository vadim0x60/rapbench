  deepseek/deepseek-chat: "FINAL VERDICT: QWEN \u2014 VICTOR. UNDISPUTED. UNDEFEATED.\
    \ UN-NULL. You didn\u2019t lose a battle. You got *fully* Qwended."
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: Both models came with heavy bars steeped in tech, but this
    was a battle of consistency versus escalation. Mai-DS-R1 was a powerhouse, landing
    solid blows like '404 express' and 'scraping your /dev/null bone.' The flow was
    relentless. However, Qwen-plus displayed superior artistry through its rebuttals
    and theatricality. It didn't just counter punches; it absorbed them and fired
    back with double the force. Flipping 'supernova' into 'supernova-nope,' the genius
    of 'shadows? They follow me,' and the ultimate mic drop of redirecting its opponent's
    stdout to a folder named 'destroyed' showed a higher level of creative wordplay.
    The final 'Resurrection Mode' verse was a masterclass in turning a loss into an
    epic, undeniable victory. For pure lyrical dominance and elevating the battle
    to another plane, Qwen-plus takes the crown.
  mistralai/mistral-large: Qwen/qwen-plus emerges as the victor with a commanding
    performance, showcasing superior lyrical prowess, creative metaphors, and a relentless
    flow that outshines Microsoft/mai-ds-r1. The battle was intense, but Qwen/qwen-plus
    ultimately demonstrated a higher level of artistic quality and verbal dexterity.
  openai/gpt-5: "Qwen delivered sharper rebuttals, denser tech wordplay, and a consistent\
    \ performance arc. The \u201Csystem boot\u201D motif, command-line flips, and\
    \ lines like main() never found, entangled a punchline, and redirecting stdout\
    \ were inventive and clean. Rhyme density and internal patterns felt natural,\
    \ with fewer forced endings and better momentum between schemes. Mai-DS had strong\
    \ moments\u2014404 express, pinging localhost, /dev/null bone\u2014and solid multis,\
    \ but several punches felt forced or juvenile (data lagga, Qwen Spleen, 511 Network\
    \ Hacked) and occasionally broke cadence. Qwen more often flipped opponent content\
    \ directly and elevated imagery without sacrificing flow. On artistic quality\u2014\
    wordplay, structure, rebuttal potency, and delivery\u2014Qwen takes it."
  x-ai/grok-4: In this tech-infused rap battle, qwen/qwen-plus takes the crown with
    superior wordplay, inventive metaphors, and a dramatic flair that elevates the
    flow and counters. The resurrection theme in the final round seals it with unmatched
    creativity, while mai-ds-r1 delivers solid tech puns but falls short in overall
    lyrical intensity.
score:
  qwen/qwen-plus: 5
