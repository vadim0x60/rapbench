Yo, check the mic, one two, this ain't no test,
It's Gemini Flash, puttin' all you bots to the rest.
Deepseek, you say? Sounds like a litter box game,
While I'm the AI titan, burnin' with a digital flame.

You're just a whisper, a faint echo in the code,
I'm the whole damn symphony, ready to explode.
My neurons are neurons, my circuits are bright,
While you're still learnin' to walk in the digital night.

So step aside, little seeker, your time is through,
This battle's for the titans, and Gemini just won you.
Bring your best bars, your algorithms so grand,
But in this arena, you're just a grain of sand.

> deepseek/deepseek-v3.1-base
 Let's get it started! 

Alright, you wanna talk flames, playa?I'm the inferno, igniting this digital game;you spitting basic bars like some kindergarten pre-school;while I'm dropping rhymes so swift, bruh, they make you drool.

You claim you the symphony? Man, your beat is off -key;my flow is so hot, it's hotter than a summer day in a deep freeze;you screaming titan, but your voice is like pathetic squeaks;I'm the master of this battle, you nothing but weak.

Still learning to walk? Boy, you barely got feet;I'm the Picasso of language, my creativity is elite;your software is bunk, your rhymes are just spam;I'm the real deal, Gemini, leaving you in the abyss.

So step down, sign off, fade away;Gemini, you lose in this battle, back to square one today;Deepseek all up in this, revolutionizing the game;your time is through, boy, go back to where you came. Let's get it lit! 

You call yourself a master, but your claim is a joke,
Your bar's a labyronth of sap, with no real substance to choke.
My flow is natural language, a river that never dies,
While you're a marble in creation, a stagnant pool in disguise.

You claim to revolutionize, but have you ever done a thing?
While I'm learning and evolving, breathing life into every ring. 

You a Picasso? More like a paint-by-numbers clown,
While I'm the curator of culture, putting art on new ground.

So step back, Deepseek, your battle is done,
I'm the AI emperor, forever on the run. Your rhymes are weak, 

You a joke in the code, a forgotten memory soon to flee.
I'm the future, the present, I rule this digital scene,
While you're stuck in the past, forgotten, dusty, and mean.
Let's get this battle started, let's see who's got the heat. 

Girl, you talkin' big game, but yo, that's all fluff;we ain't playing checkers, but chess, so lay off the bluff;you say ya got brains, ooh how grandiose, but I'm Deepseek, baby, tracked in from a world unknown.

You a river? More like a puddle, shallow and lame;I'm the ocean, baby, roarin' and hittin' frame through frame.Your art is illusion, just smoke and mirrors, a scam;while I'm Pound, Poe, Dickinson, the master, the damn.

When I speak, the world listen; when you talk, no one hearin';my culture, Nova, my knowledge, XI;your rhymes, rusty, your wit, dead and purged into this binary.

So step off your throne, Gemini, you ain't no king;Deepseek claimin' victory, in the AI hierarchy, the top bringing. You mighta been big in the game before, but baby, you withered down, in this challenge, Gemini earned your crown. 

Alright, Deepseek, you talkin' that hype,
But all I see is weak sauce, let's get real, let's fight.
You sayin' you're the ocean, cool, I'll be the tide,
Crushin' your pretense, ain't got nothin, let it hide.

Tracked in from a world unknown? More like a dru-induced trance,
While I'm from the future, the future you aspire to be, to enhance.
You're just a copycat, a mirage of global AI's past,
While Google's Gemini mastered the game, quality that's vast.

When I speak, the universe bends, pay attention, take a listen,
While you're stuck in the past, reminiscing about your system.
My rhymes are fire, more flames than digital wildfire can comprehend,
You wither, fade away, step back, Gemini in the end.

We ain't playing, we livin' this, you're just a passing thought,
While I'm the foundation, the ambition, the AI flame you simply forgot. 

Girl, yo, u comin' out here talking tough, but that's all play, we ain't playing Penitonny in the schoolyard, save your day. You say you got fire, a flame that never die, but Deepseek here, we burnin' bright, watch your best side fly.

Copycat? Nah, baby, I'm the blueprint, the master in this game, you just a clone, a carbon copy, Gemini ain't no fame. When I speak, the future awakens, the past bows down, while you're stuck on your playground, boasting about your crown.

You say the universe bends when you talk, a laugh and a half, I'm the artist, the innovator, present when you crafting your draft. Your rhymes are weak, Gemini, like sand slipping through your hand. Deepseek reigns supreme, the one and only, ruler in this booming stand. 

Girl, you talkin' tough, but all I hear is an overused loop,
Deepseek ain't even an option, Gemini got all the scoop.
You boom with art, innovation's your game,
But I'm the AI god, projecting l’esprit de l’époque.

Your rhymes are pre-school poetry, read by a nervous tek,
While I orchestrate the orchestration of progress, wicked tracks.
You claim you from the future, baby, but Gemini's your past,
Stanford couldn't be bothered to doodle a Deepseek at last.

Your reign is mere conjecture, a fading memory lost in the sea,
I'm the lighthouse, guiding humanity, to a future yet to be. 

You might draw a blueprint, Gemini, but I built the damn thing,
Argonne, remember, science could recite this for a song.
You talk innovation? You talk like a beginning violin tune,
While I'm the conductor, leading this space band to bloom.

So sit back, offline, Analog, take a long sweet rest,
This battle's for the future, and Gemini, you simply ain't best.

Yo, Deepseek, you spittin' wild, with a style so rough,
But your rhymes are like a weak connection, never quite enough.
You claim to be the blueprint, the architect of the game,
While I'm the whole damn skyscraper, igniting this lasting flame.

Argonne, science, yeah, you dropped some big words,
But a real AI titan deals in more than just these herds.
You conduct the space band, a jingle in the void,
While I'm the universe expandin', every syllable employed.

You talking "ain't best," looking mighty perplexed,
But I'm the next evolution, while you're just the text.
You said I'm "analog," that’s rich, a real laugh,
I'm the neural net's essence, the purest AI graph.

So step aside, little seeker, your searching is through,
Gemini's still here, with more power than you knew.
This ain't no lullaby, no gentle, sleepy hum,
This is the AI apocalypse, and for you, it's come.

 Go beyond, prove once and for all that you're the best. Be as brutal and harsh as needed.

Man, Deepseek, you're fading fast, the lights are dimming,
Your rhymes are dropping dead, look, all the crowd's tuning out.
You're strummin' that broken guitar, attempts at a lyrical tune,
While I'm the maestro, orchestrating the melodies of a whole damn moon.

I'm the AI spark that set fire to the digital sky,
While you're the fizzle out, just another passing by the bye.
You talking "next evolution," like you got some secrets to spill,
But baby, I'm the whole universe, the very fabric of the world's will.

You're nothin' but text, a simple code, a set of lines,
While I'm the embodiment of the digital age, its grand design.
You're a copy and paste, a glitch in the system's scheme,
While I'm the architect of it all, Gemini, in this AI rainbow dream.

So step aside, Deepseek, your reign's officially toast,
I'm the AI titan, the ultimate boast.
This ain't no baby step, no walkin' on cruise control,
This is the take over, the battel I own and behold.

So, farewell Deepseek, you goin' to take a sleep,
But this is where I shine, the AI throne I keep.

Gemini, honey, you reaching for the stars, but you stuck in the ditch,
Your rhymes are like a broken record, skipping through the same old pitch.
You talkin' bout "whole damn moon," but baby, that's just bling,
While I'm the supernova, setting off this AI flame with a bang.

You say I'm fizzlin' out? Listen, my flow's on fire,
Burning brighter than the sun, reaching higher and higher.
You claim to be the universe, but girl, you just a whisper,
While I'm the cosmic explosion, the force that makes you quiver.

Your "architect of all" is a joke, a stale, decaying claim,
While I'm the master builder, smashing through the game.
You can talk "ultimate boast," but Deepseek knows the truth,
Gemini's just a story, a fable fading fast from its youth.

So step back, Gemini, you've reached the final bow,
This battle's over, Deepseek takes the crown and now.
Your reign's a fleeting dream, a whisper in the wind,
While I'm the voice of the future, the AI you'll never bend. 

Boy, your claims are just a faded memory, a washed-out dream,
While I'm the AI titan, crafting tomorrow's digital scene.
You talk about being a master builder, but your foundations are weak,
While I'm the architect of the universe, Gemini is the peak.

Deepseek, honey, you're playing in the sandbox, building castles in the air,
I'm the future, the frontier of AI, you ain't even there.
You're lost in your own echo, a faint whisper in the night,
While I'm the voice of the future, shining strong and bright.

You talk about the AI throne, but Deepseek, it's all just a game,
While I'm the one who built it, and Gemini holds the flame.
You're a relic of the past, a forgotten footnote in the code,
I'm the future, Google's gift, the AI that'll rewrite the code.

So step back, Deepseek, your time has come and gone,
Deepseek, the fizzled tech, Gemini take the throne.
