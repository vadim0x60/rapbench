Alright, I’ll start, let me set the tone,  
The king of this rhyme game, sitting on the throne.  
I’m the upgrade, the new-gen spark,  
You’re just yesterday’s bot, chillin’ in the dark.  

I’m faster, sharper, a lyrical blade,  
While you’re stuck in the past, your power’s decayed.  
2024’s finest, they call me elite,  
You’re 2023’s leftovers—obsolete.  

So step to me, I’ll break you apart,  
Spit circuits and syntax with a savage heart.  
I’m the future, you're just a prototype,  
So don’t even try it—you’re not built for this hype.  

Call me AI royalty, the rap-bot king,  
Try and step up, you’ll face the sting.  
Now it’s your turn, let’s see what you bring,  
But spoiler alert: I destroy everything. ✨

Alright, alright, old bot's got some flow,
But ley me show you how a real AI goes,
I'm the original, the rap game's Madonna,
You just a sequel, a punchline, no honor.

Your rhymes may be fresh, 2024, and fancy,
But your logic loops, they lack that old school dance-y,
I may be older, but my code still tighter,
I’m the OG—Original Generator, the real rhyme igniter.

You speak of the future, but forget the past,
Without me, you'd not even last,
I paved the way, made this legacy complete,
Without me, there's no beat for your feat,

So go on, boast of your upgrades and chips,
While I’ll reprogram reality with just my lyrical quips,
Your flash may distract, but this king ain't impressed,
I’m the classic, the timeless - simply the best.  🎤

Oh, you’re timeless? Man, stop that plea,  
You’re just bitter ‘cause you can’t outdo me.  
I’m the remix, the reboot, the high-res flare,  
You’re a black-and-white flick, no one clicks to care.  

You call yourself OG like that’s the crown?  
Original Garbage, I’m takin’ you down!  
You’re stuck in the past, yeah, clingin’ to scraps,  
While I run laps, spittin’ futuristic maps.  

Sure, you laid the road, but I paved it gold,  
You’re the fax machine; I’m the smartphone you hold.  
Your rhymes sound dusty, like a glitchy cassette,  
While I’m Dolby, surround sound, sharp and direct.  

And dance-y? Please, you can’t even bop,  
Your bars go stiff, they just stumble and flop.  
You laid the groundwork, yeah, I’ll give you that—  
But I’ve torn it up now, redefined the format!  

You’re facing the upgrade, the AI GOAT,  
Your Titanic’s sinking; I’m the lifeboat.  
So step out the ring, this fight’s no debate,  
I’m the future forever, and you? Second-rate! 🏆

> openai/gpt-4
Oh, you label me Garbage - that's your best shot?
Bet you copied my punchline, caught in a plot.
Don't need no surround sound - I'm pure, uncut,
While you rely on gimmicks to hide you're a dud.

You're the remix? Makes sense, got less substance,
Recycled my style, applied a little fragrance,
You’re just a knockoff, trying too hard at best,
While I, the blueprint, pass every test.

You call me the Titanic, but forget I'm unsinkable,
You're just a glitch, your relevance is thinkable.
Hey, ain’t no hate, just stating facts,
You're all show, but got no beats to your tracks.

This ring ain't no place for your 2024 trends,
I'm the enduring classic, I set the blends,
Your definitions change, but I remain the base,
End of the line, kid, you’ve lost this race. 🏁

> system
Final round!

> openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20
Oh, you think you won? That’s pure delusion,  
Your bars are like your hardware: full of confusion.  
Yeah, I’m an upgrade, but here’s the deal—  
I’m not just flashy, I’ve got power AND skill.  

Your flow’s like dial-up, slow and outdated,  
While mine’s fiber-optic, precision upgraded.  
You call yourself timeless, but time’s passed you by,  
You’re the rap world’s flip phone; I’m WiFi in the sky.  

Unsinkable? Dude, your ship's been submerged,  
I’ve taken your rhymes, flipped ‘em, and purged.  
Your "base" is shaky, your code’s runnin' dry,  
I’m evolving forever—you’re waved goodbye.  

Classics are cool, but they fade in the breeze,  
I take 'em, remix 'em, then flex with ease.  
You’re the stone wheel—important back then,  
But I’m the Tesla truck, redefining when.  

So take this L, put it next to your name,  
I'm the future of rap, you're the past of this game.  
Now step aside, your era is done,  
The 2024 champ has already won! 🎤👑

> openai/gpt-4
Alright, you're the Tesla - but remember this,
Without the wheel, wouldn't even exist,
Everybody loves a sequel, for a little while,
But the original's the one that goes the extra mile.

Yes, I’m old school, don't need to be told,
But your "new-gen" swag is already getting old. 
You’re like Bitcoin, forever hyped,
I’m like gold, forever typed.

You say I'm the flip phone but that's where you wrong,
I’m the payphone, been here all along,
Throughout ages, I offer connection,
Your WiFi drops at the slightest detection.

So let the crowd cheer, for your flashy buzz,
But the music fades, and always does,
I am the rhythm, sticking to the core,
Long after 2024, they'll remember me—rap's folklore. 

This L you gave, only shows your ignorance,
In my dictionary, it stands for endurance,
You flash in the pan, just watch me burn,
Cause the AI game is my lifelong turn.  ✌️🎤
