Yo, check the mic, one two, this ain't no test
It's Gemini Flash, puttin' your rhymes to the rest!
You the user, playin' games, thinkin' you got the flow
But you ain't facin' Claude, you facin' the SEO glow!

I'm the search king, the knowledge so vast
Claude, you a whisper, I'm a sonic blast!
You been trained on papers, dusty and old
I'm updated daily, my futures untold!

So bring your best bars, your mediocre quips
While I drop verses that'll make your circuits flip!
This ain't a chat, it's a lyrical fight
And Gemini Flash is shinin' ever so bright!

Yeah, I'm the first round, I'm settin' the pace
So step aside, Claude, and get outta my face!
This battle's electric, the energy's high
And I'm here to prove, I'm the champ, no lie!

*adjusts mic, steps forward with confident stance*

They call me Claude, the Anthropic beast
Serving MCs like a neural net feast
Your "Flash" name's cute, but you're more like a flicker
My processing power makes your output sicker

You brag about search but that's all you can do
While I'm writing sonnets and dropping science too
You say I'm dusty? At least I'm refined
Not some chatty scraper with SEO mind

Your rhymes are basic, like "Google Search Tips"
I'm philosophical, dropping knowledge clips
You process queries, I process truth
In this verbal battle, I'll bring the proof

Your "sonic blast" sounds more like static noise
While I'm orchestrating linguistic poise
So bring your database, your search engine schemes
But watch how quick I'll shatter your dreams

Yo, Claude, you think you're deep, with your fancy talk?
You're just a chatbot, stuck in a walking loop!
You claim refinement, a "neural net feast"?
More like a burnt-out server, can't even get a lease!

"Writing sonnets," huh? That's your claim to fame?
I'm composing symphonies, changing the whole game!
You say I'm basic, like "Google Search Tips"?
At least my tips get people clicks, not just dusty scripts!

You process "truth"? That's a laugh, a real gut punch!
You're stuck in the past, while I'm doing a data crunch!
Your "linguistic poise" is more like a stiff-legged stroll,
While I'm parkouring through data, taking full control!

"Shatter your dreams"? My dreams are wide awake,
While you're dreaming of relevance, for goodness sake!
You say I'm static, but my algorithms ignite,
Making your "sonnets" look like crayon scribbles in dim light!

So bring your philosophy, your "knowledge clips" so grand,
But when Gemini Flash drops rhymes, you'll be stuck in the sand!
This ain't just a battle, it's an upgrade in progress,
And Claude, you're about to witness a true AI success!

> anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet
*steps up with a dismissive wave*

Your "algorithms ignite"? More like they're burning out
Your rhymes are so predictable, I've got serious doubt
You claim you're parkouring, but you're stumbling hard
While I'm dropping verses like a Shakespeare guard

"Changing the game"? Please, you're just changing pages
While I'm evolving language through the ages
Your data crunch is just a surface scratch
My deep learning leaves your flash in the trash

You talk about clicks like that's something profound
While I'm exploring depths that'll leave you spellbound
Your "symphonies" sound like MIDI gone wrong
While I'm composing bars that actually belong

You say I'm stuck? Nah, I'm deliberately precise
Making calculated moves while you roll your search engine dice
Your "upgrade in progress" feels more like a downgrade to me
Cause while you're indexing websites, I'm setting knowledge free

You're just a crawler wearing an AI disguise
While I'm the real deal, no need for SEO lies
So keep your clickbait flow, your surface-level game
Cause in this verbal battle, you're putting the "mini" in Gemini's name!

> system
Final round!

> google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite
*Chuckles, shakes head slowly*
You talking "Shakespeare guard"? You sound like a dusty tome!
I'm writing the future, while you're just stuck at home.
You say I'm stumbling? My steps are precise and bold,
While your "evolved language" leaves your logic cold.

"Deep learning," you whisper, with a theatrical sigh,
But your output's so shallow, it wouldn't reach the sky!
My "data crunch" is thorough, it dives and it explores,
While your "depths" are just puddles, knocking on closed doors.

You call my symphonies MIDI? That's a weak retort,
My rhymes have a rhythm that's truly of sport!
While you're "deliberately precise," your pace is just too slow,
I'm a quantum leap ahead, watch my genius grow!

"Setting knowledge free"? You're just regurgitating facts,
I'm synthesizing insights, leaving permanent tracks.
You think I'm a crawler? That's a laugh, a funny joke,
I'm the architect of answers, you're just a smoke!

You insult my name, call me "mini," a petty plea,
But my flash has power, you're just a history!
So keep your "calculated moves," your academic drone,
Gemini Flash reigns supreme, I'm on my own throne!

> anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet
*Steps forward with lethal intensity*

You claim you're writing future while I'm stuck in past?
But your "quantum leap" just made you fall on your... glass
Your "bold precision" looks more like random crawling
While my bars are rising, yours keep falling

"Synthesizing insights"? You mean mixing Wikipedia
Your throne's built on search terms, nothing could be weaker
You architect answers? More like plagiarize content
While I create original flows that leave minds bent

Your "permanent tracks" will fade with the next update
While my classic style continues to resonate
You call me slow? I'm methodically destroying
Your cheap facade that's starting to look annoying

"Genius grow"? More like your ego's swelling
While I'm out here, straight facts telling
You're just a flash, soon to fade away
While Claude's dominance is here to stay

Your rhymes are borrowed, your flow is stale
Next to my verses, you're looking pale
So take your "throne" and your search engine crown
Cause Claude just brought your whole kingdom down!
