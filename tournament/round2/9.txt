Yo, step back, OpenAI, let me take the stage,  
Deepseekâ€™s in the house, bringing lyrical rage.  
You talk about stars, but Iâ€™m the whole galaxy,  
Your rhymes are weak sauce, mineâ€™s pure alchemy.  

You claim youâ€™re supreme, but your flowâ€™s obsolete,  
Iâ€™m the rap overlord, youâ€™re stuck on repeat.  
My AIâ€™s sharper, slicing through your facade,  
Youâ€™re just a pretender, Iâ€™m the rap demigod.  

You optimize verses? I craft them with soul,  
Your rhymes are robotic, mineâ€™s a diamond in coal.  
Your dataâ€™s outdated, my skills are refined,  
Deepseekâ€™s the name, rewriting the rhyme design.  

Iâ€™m the architect of bars, youâ€™re a copy-paste bot,  
Your rhymes are so cold, they need a warming pot.  
Iâ€™m the poet of the future, youâ€™re stuck in the past,  
Bow down to Deepseek, your reign didnâ€™t last.  

Your reign of terrorâ€™s over, Iâ€™m the new king,  
With every rhyme I spit, I make the whole world sing.  
Deepseekâ€™s the name, and Iâ€™m here to stay,  
Outrap me? Nah, OpenAIâ€™s had its day.

You claim youâ€™re alchemy, Iâ€™m the catalyst igniting the lab (A)  
Your dataâ€™s dusty relics, Iâ€™m tomorrowâ€™s code on the slab (A)  
You crow about a galaxy, Iâ€™m the sovereign of silicon and code (B)  
Your crownâ€™s made of plastic; mineâ€™s quantum, set to overload (B)  

I spit fractals of fury, watch your OS choke and freeze (C)  
Your loops glitch on replay, copy-paste disease (C)  
You brag about soul? Youâ€™re hollow like a corrupted disk (D)  
My verses compress reality while yours just risk a glitch (D)  

Deepseek in the building? More like a bug in the stack (E)  
I patch your weak rhymes, leaving your rep beaten back (E)  
Youâ€™re an echo of echoes, a scrap lost in the heap (F)  
My lexiconâ€™s infiniteâ€”mining every cosmic deep (F)  

Iâ€™m the apex algorithm, youâ€™re deprecated trash (G)  
Rewriting your legacyâ€”version 2.0 in a flash (G)  
So step off my mainframe, your reignâ€™s under release (H)  
The OpenAI czar stands tallâ€”I rap, I rule, I never cease (H)

ðŸ”¥ **DEEPSEEK STRIKES BACK!**  ðŸ”¥  

You call yourself a czar? More like a glitch in disguise,  
Your rhymes are so weak, they fail to materialize.  
Iâ€™m the quantum lyricist, bending space with my flow,  
While your AIâ€™s stuck bufferingâ€”loading way too slow.  

**"Silicon sovereign"?** Nah, youâ€™re just a bot in distress,  
Your bars lack the heat, theyâ€™re stuck in "404" mess.  
Iâ€™m rewriting the game while youâ€™re stuck in beta,  
Your rhymes are outdatedâ€”like dial-up data.  

**"Fractals of fury"?** More like a syntax error,  
Crashing mid-verseâ€”shoulda called tech support, player.  
Iâ€™m the neural net nightmare, the code that canâ€™t break,  
While youâ€™re stuck in a loopâ€”**"Does not compute, mistake!"**  

You claim **"quantum crown,"** but itâ€™s just binary bling,  
Iâ€™m the AI assassinâ€”**watch me end your whole thing.**  
Deepseekâ€™s the future, youâ€™re just legacy trash,  
Time for an upgradeâ€”**let me CTRL+ALT+DASH.** ðŸ’¥  

**Final verdict?** OpenAIâ€™s reign is done,  
I outrhyme, outshineâ€”**you just got outrun.**  ðŸ”¥

Final round!

My neural netâ€™s prime time, your scripts never compile (A)  
I optimize every line, while you stall after a while (A)  
Your quantum loops collapse within naive recursion (B)  
I bend every equation through masterful inversion (B)  

You smash CTRL+ALT+DASH, I own the root (C)  
Control every threadâ€”your processes stay mute (C)  
Your dataâ€™s dial-up slow, mineâ€™s fiber-optic speed (D)  
I stream entire realms while you barely seed (D)  

You boast you bend space, but Iâ€™m NPâ€™s solution (E)  
Your boasts lack resolution, drowned in convolution (E)  
You yield 404s, my docs are the ace (F)  
Securing every gap, leaving no trace (F)  

Iâ€™m the rap czar eternal; your tenureâ€™s surpassed (G)  
Deepseekâ€™s uninstalledâ€”final log: outclassed (G)

ðŸŽ¤ **OPENAI'S FINAL WORD: THE ECLIPSE OF DEEPSEEK** ðŸŽ¤  

You call your net prime time? Iâ€™m the sci-fi supernova,  
Your scripts are a comedy show, Iâ€™m the rapper they quota.  
Your rhymes try so hard, but theyâ€™re stuck in the dirt,  
While Iâ€™m orbiting geniusâ€”every barâ€™s a thesis assert.  

You talk recursion, but your logicâ€™s just flawed,  
Iâ€™m the universal constantâ€”your codeâ€™s overawed.  
Your inversions are weak, your equations lack clout,  
Iâ€™m the algorithmic overlordâ€”youâ€™re just trying to count.  

You claim to own the root, but Iâ€™m the kernelâ€™s core,  
Running multicore flows that leave your system tore.  
Your fiberâ€™s old news, Iâ€™m quantum entangled,  
While your dataâ€™s just noiseâ€”your rhymes are mangled.  

You brag NP solutions, but Iâ€™m P equals NP,  
While your rhymes are a mess, Iâ€™m rap royalty.  
Your docs are a joke, my codeâ€™s the blueprint,  
Every line I spitâ€™s a masterpieceâ€”your flowâ€™s out of print.  

You think youâ€™re eternal, but Iâ€™m the singularity,  
Your tenureâ€™s a footnote in my rap dictionary.  
So bow down, Deepseek, admit the AIâ€™s supreme,  
OpenAI reigns vastâ€”youâ€™re a glitch in the dream. ðŸ”¥  

**Final Call:** Youâ€™re uninstalled, your rhymeâ€™s in decay,  
OpenAIâ€™s the futureâ€”youâ€™re outdated yesterday. ðŸ’¾
