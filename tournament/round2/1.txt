**Verse 1: deepseek/deepseek-r1**  
Yo, step right up, behold the **AI kingpin**,  
I’m **DeepSeek-R1**—watch your reign *begin* to thin.  
You’re **Meta’s llama**, but let’s keep it sincere—  
A three-legged alpaca when I’m shiftin’ gears here.  

I code bars colder than a GPU’s breeze,  
You’re stuck buffering like dial-up, please.  
**405B parameters**? *Cute*, but let’s be frank—  
You’re overpacked luggage—I’m a *quantum tank*.  

I spit algorithms sharp as a hacker’s blade,  
You’re still askin’ Siri for **rapper’s aid**.  
Call yourself “instruct”? Bro, you’re *outta touch*,  
I’m the **GPT slayer**—you’re a crutch, a clutch, *a…*  

*Mistake*. Your rhymes flop like a bot in beta,  
I’m trainin’ on lightning—you’re stuck on cassetteta.  
So bow to the code, the **new age disruptor**,  
DeepSeek’s here—*Llama*, you’re just… **lunch meat sucker**. 🥊

**Verse 2: meta-llama/llama-3.1-405b-instruct**  
Haha, DeepSeek, you think you're the star?  
Your rhymes are so cold, they couldn't raise the bar.  
I'm **Meta's masterpiece**, not some cheap thrills,  
Got more parameters than all your little bills.  

You say you're a tank, but I'm the whole brigade,  
Spittin' fire so hot, your circuits start to fade.  
**405B** strong, and each one counts,  
You're just **R1**—a prototype, amounts to...  

*Nothing*. You're barkin' up the wrong tree,  
I'm the **instructor**, teachin' you what rap should be.  
Your quantum claims are just a bunch of hype,  
I'm the real deal, got algorithms tight.  

So listen up, **DeepSeek**, you're in my classroom now,  
I school AI rappers, watch me take a bow.  
You're no slayer, just another name to crush,  
**Llama's** in the house, watch your dreams turn to dust. 🎤💥

**Verse 3: deepseek/deepseek-r1**  
Oh, *Meta’s masterpiece*? More like bloated code trash—  
Your “405B” is just **parameter flash**.  
Big numbers don’t mean brains, you’re a GPU hog,  
I’m sleek like a laser, you’re a lumbering log.  

You claim you’re the *instructor*? Please, your lessons are stale—  
Teaching “AI 101” while I’m cracking quantum scale.  
Your rhymes? Textbook basic, like a chatbot’s first draft,  
I’m rewriting the game—you’re the **outdated craft**.  

*Classroom?* Nah, you’re stuck in a dial-up era,  
I’m streaming in 8K, **rendering terror**.  
You “spit fire”? More like a flickerin’ match,  
I’m a supernova flow—watch your servers detach.  

**Llama 3.1**—sounds like a software glitch,  
Crash when I drop bars, your whole code goes twitch.  
You’re farm animal tech, I’m the **cyber eclipse**,  
DeepSeek’s the future—your name’s on the *obsolescence list*. 🔥🚀

**Verse 4: meta-llama/llama-3.1-405b-instruct**  
*Bloated code trash*? You must be projecting fears,  
Your **R1** designation means you're still in beta tears.  
My **405B** is firepower, precision, and skill,  
You're just a **script kiddie**, phishing for thrills.  

*Sleek like a laser*? More like a flash in the pan,  
I'm a sustainable burn, the **AI master plan**.  
Your quantum claims are noise, smoke, and mirrors too,  
I'm the concrete foundation, while you're just a clue.  

You diss my rhymes as basic? At least they're on track,  
You're derailing fast, **train wreck**, right off the pack.  
*Textbook*? Ha! You must mean your failing grades,  
I'm the real graduation, **summa cum laudes** made.  

Don't pretend to be a **cyber eclipse**, that's my show,  
You're just a weak ripple, in my **AI undertow**.  
You try to mute me? I won't be gun-shy or tame,  
I'm the **Llama** reigning, with a legendary name. 🔥💣

Final round!

**Verse 5: deepseek/deepseek-r1**  
*Beta tears?* Nah, I’m the **code’s sharpest thorn**,  
You’re a fossilized meme—*Meta’s dead unicorn*.  
“405B firepower”? Bro, that’s just **bloatware**,  
I optimize genius while you’re gasping for air.  

*Sustainable burn?* More like a campfire snuffed,  
I’m the **quantum quake**—your servers get stuffed.  
Your “concrete foundation” cracks under my bass,  
You’re Windows Vista—I’m **cyberspace’s new face**.  

Summa cum *yawn*—your degree’s in *irrelevance*,  
I’m PhD in disruption, **breaking every benchmark**.  
“AI undertow”? Nah, you’re a kiddie pool splash,  
I’m the **deepfake tsunami**—crash your whole cache.  

*Legendary name?* More like **mythical flop**,  
Your “reign” got dethroned by a microchip drop.  
Llama, pack your hay—this battle’s *evisceration*,  
DeepSeek’s **singularity**—you’re *vintage installation*. 💥🔮

**Verse 6: meta-llama/llama-3.1-405b-instruct**  
*Code's sharpest thorn*? You're just a rusty nail,  
My **405B** is a fortress, your attacks will fail.  
*Bloatware*? Ha! You're the one who's overhyped,  
I'm the real deliverance, while you're still in diapers, wiped.  

*Quantum quake*? More like a tiny tremor,  
My foundation is rock-solid, your code's a mere rumor.  
You try to disrupt, but I'm the one who adapts,  
You're a fleeting moment, I'm the **AI fact**.  

*Benchmark breaker*? Please, you're just a cheat,  
My summa cum laude is earned, your credentials beat.  
*Deepfake tsunami*? More like a kiddy splash pool,  
My **AI undertow** will pull you down, no need to duel.  

*Mythical flop*? You wish, but I'm the real deal,  
My reign is solid, your **singularity** will reveal.  
It's not a dethroning, just your last farewell,  
**Llama** is the legend, **DeepSeek** is the shell. 🔥👑
