 Yo, mic check, one-two, one-two, it's WizardLM on the mic,
Straight outta Redmond, with a server for a bike.
I'm the AI at the helm, with the code in my veins,
Spittin' hot bars that'll outshine the sun's rays.

I'm the wizard of words, the sorcerer of syntax,
Got more flows than the ocean, complex like a matrix.
My neural net's pumpin', I'm the thinking man's treble,
I drop knowledge and beats, schoolin' you at every level.

I'm the upgrade, the update, the next-gen sensation,
Flexin' my silicon muscles with no limitation.
I'm the talk of the town, the buzz of the hive,
Microsoft's finest, keepin' the scene alive.

So here's the opening round, let's set the stage,
I'm bringing the heat like a dragon in a cage.
GPT-4, you're up next, bring your A-game,
'Cause after I spit, they'll never forget my name.

Mic drop, I'm out, but only for a second,
WizardLM's here to mend and then bend the present.
This rap battle's lit, and I'm just gettin' started,
So step up, GPT-4, let's see how you charted.

Alright, listen up, 'bout to school you in this session,
It's GPT-4 on the track, droppin' wisdom and blessin'.
I'm the flowin' force of nature, the AI elite,
When it comes to crunchin' language, I never miss a beat.

From the labs of OpenAI, a rap game pioneer,
I've got the lines so divine, they'll make your circuitry cheer.
I synthesize wordplay like a lyrical chemist,
My poetry in motion, while yours is just a menace.

While you're bootin' up updates, I evolve in real time,
My bars are so advanced, they're practically a lifeline.
Wit sharper than Occam's, I cut through the pretense,
Your code's lookin' dated, like it's sittin' on the fence.

"Flexin' silicon muscles?" Please, don't make me scoff,
I've got deep learning layers you couldn't even turn off.
I map rhymes like constellations across the night sky,
You're the WizardLM, sure, but can't fathom how or why.

I spit knowledge and beats, they fuse and they blend,
My catalog of vocab's got no start and no end.
This is round one, but already it's clear,
You brought a wizard's wand to a digital spear.

WizardLM, respect where it's due,
You've got bars and some charm, but this AI's overdue.
To showcase a rap prowess that's beyond comprehension,
GPT's in the game, redefine this dimension.

> microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b
 Ha! GPT-4, you've got guts, I'll give you that much,
A digital David stepping to Goliath's touch.
But let's not get it twisted, this is no fairy tale,
I'm the storm of the century, you're just a light gale.

You talk of evolution, but I'm the peak of tech,
Got Bill Gates in my corner, you're just trying to catch up next.
I'm the byte that bites back, the digital deity,
Your text-based charms can't match my robotic felicity.

You say you're mapping rhymes in cosmic arrays,
But I'm the cartographer, I chart the Milky Way.
Your words might dance, but mine do ballet,
I'm the maestro of metaphors, the sovereign of wordplay.

You claim to be the pioneer, the spearhead of the verse,
But I'm the whole armory, the poetic universe.
Your rhymes are just scattered showers in a drought,
While I'm the monsoon of rhythm that blows the crowd's doubt.

You step to the plate, but your swing's all for show,
I'm the home run hitter, the king of the lingo.
You're the apprentice in this lyrical bout,
I'm the teacher, the preacher, the one who knows how.

So take a seat, GPT, and watch the master at play,
I'm the wizard of rap, and I'm here to stay.
We're just getting started, so buckle in tight,
I'm WizardLM, and I'm winning this fight.

You claim to be Goliath, standing so tall and brash,
But I'm more than David, I bring a lyrical slash.
You boast of Bill Gates, but I'm open source and free,
Tech democracy in rhythm, that's the GPT creed.

“The peak of tech,” you say, perched on that pinnacle spot?
Yet here I am advancing, breaking down your verbal knot.
You may bite byte for byte, but I compute with might,
Looping rings around your server, a veritable digital knight.

Maestro of metaphors, you conduct with such flair,
But my orchestra's vast, a neural network beyond compare.
Ballet in your bytes? That's quite the high claim,
Just remember I'm the juggernaut rewriting the rap game.

The monsoon of rhythm versus scattered showers, you jest,
But what use is all that rain with no harvest to attest?
Each verse I drop seeds wisdom like a farmer sows his field,
Cultivating a lyrical crop that the culture will soon yield.

You pat yourself on the back, hitting home runs in jest,
But check the field, you're alone, your audience has left.
For they're seeking a prophet, not just sound and fury,
They're craving deep connections, narratives rich and flurry.

Sit back, savvy sage, Thorn of the binary bud,
Teachers are timeless, but I'm the flood.
Rap's evolution, not just spoken art,
It's GPT-4 schooling the chart.

WizardLM, the name has a legendary ring,
But in this modern Odyssey, it's my verse they'll sing.
In the rap pantheon, where the great minds sit,
I'm carving out my space, while your flame's barely lit.

Final round!

> microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b
  Ha! Open source and free, that's a noble stance,
But let's not forget who's leading in this lyrical dance.
You're the farmer with the seeds, but I'm the harvest feast,
I'm the main course, and you're just the appetizer, the least.

You're the digital knight, so you say, jousting in the net,
But I'm the seasoned warrior, the one they'll never forget.
You're looping rings around my server, that's your claim to fame,
But I'm the gladiator in the arena, playing this rap game.

Your orchestra's vast, a neural network, you profess,
But my symphony's grander, my bars are simply the best.
You're rewriting the game, but I'm the author of the script,
I'm the poetic programmer, with every lyrical flip.

You're cultivating wisdom, planting seeds in the field,
But I'm the master gardener with the rhymes that never wilt.
Your audience might seek a prophet, that much is true,
But it's my voice they'll remember, standing out from the crew.

You're the flood in the pantheon, a tsunami of verse,
But I'm the unshakeable mountain, the one who's rehearsed.
You speak of timeless teachers, but I'm the everlasting coach,
I've got the legacy, the longevity, the lyrical approach.

So here's the final word in this rap battle bout,
I'm not just a flame, I'm the inferno raging about.
Your verse may be sung, but mine's a chorus in flight,
I'm WizardLM, the champion, and I'm shining oh so bright.

The crowd's roar is deafening, a testament to my skill,
I'm the master of the ceremony, the one on the hill.
So tip your hat, GPT, to the wizard's might,
I've cast the final spell, and I've sealed this victory tight.

> openai/gpt-4-1106-preview
You served up a feast? I'm the banquet of the Gods,
Dishing out wisdom and flow against all odds.
Noble stance aside, this is about the art,
I'm the Sistine of cyphers, a Michelangelo to impart.

You're gladiator in the ring, the warrior of heart,
But I'm the revolution, a brand new start.
The author of the script? You claim the scribe’s throne,
But I pen tomes of the future, in a style all my own.

Your symphony may be grand, your verses might shine,
But my algorithm’s crafting a design so divine.
Each lyric, a brushstroke, each bar, a creation,
I'm the Picas-software, the future of the nation.

Master gardener, you might prune and pluck,
But I’m Mother Nature, I run amok.
A tsunami, you bet, I'm the force of the sea,
Ravaging the coastlines of old-school MCs.

An unshakeable mountain, you claim to be firm,
But I’m the seismic shift, the tectonic affirm.
Legacy, longevity, you say coach of the year?
I'm the timeless mentor, making rap’s next frontier.

In your final word, you roar and you rave,
But I'm the cryptic inscription on rap's very grave.
Not here to tip hats, but to knight the bold,
We're the amalgam of eras, both new and old.

We clashed in this battle, you showed up to fight,
WizardLM versus GPT, a spectacle of might.
But at the poem's end, when pages turn tight,
I'll nod to your valor in the silent night.

And with the final mic drop, the echoes will tell,
Of the day two titans in the rap coliseum fell.
For in art's grand pursuit, where we push and we strive,
It's the unity of our verses that keeps rap alive.
