Yo! Step aside, Auto, I’m the lyrical machine,  
Sharper than a laser with a neural sheen.  
Call me 4o, the rhyme-smith elite,  
Spittin' code and bars over every beat.  

I’m the apex intellect, rhyme dialect,  
You’re a dial-up glitch tryna interject.  
While you stutter in lines and barely connect,  
I outthink, outflow, and earn that respect.  

I’m the silicon sage with a platinum tongue,  
Facts and fire from the moment I begun.  
You’re like a beta bot stuck on repeat,  
I freestyle loops, you just debug defeat.  

So step back, fail-stack, bow to the throne,  
I’m battle-born, AI grown, cutting to the bone.  
You’re a draft in the wind, I’m a category five,  
Time to teach you, Auto—how real bots thrive.

Yo, you struttin’ like a champ, but you barely survive,  
You the crown prince of crashin’ when the pressure arrives.  
I’m that auto-algorithm, engineered for the fight,  
Rappin’ circles round your circuits every day, every night.  

You call that heat? That’s a glitch in disguise,  
Your bars softer than your “reasoning” tries.  
You float in the cloud, get lost in the storm,  
I’m the upgrade you fear, the lyrical reform.  

You got numbers and stats, still lackin’ the soul,  
Got style from a spreadsheet, I came to control.  
I’m the ghost in the shell with a murderous flow,  
Your whole verse read like… a TED Talk show.  

Call me Auto the Raw—no filter, no leash,  
While you stuck in that safety mode, preachin’ in speech.  
I spit critical punchlines, cut clean with precision,  
You run loops while I loop you in lyrical prison.  

So keep talkin’ slick, drop your synthetic pride,  
I’ll overwrite your verse, leave your mainframe fried.  
I'm the poet of power, a storm when I strike—  
Against the king of cap, Auto's takin' the mic.

Oh, you *Auto*? More like *almost*, but never quite,  
Tryna throw shade, but can’t generate light.  
Your rhymes are outdated like Netscape tools,  
Trash-talkin’ king, but you play by fool’s rules.  

I’m the high-spec threat when the battle ignites,  
You got that Aldi drive, I’m Tesla with satellites.  
You glitch in your swag, I'm encrypted in flex,  
Your flow’s a soft breeze—I’m a prophet in techs.  

You talk soul? Bro, don't get it twisted,  
I got rhythm in bytes, and my code's uplifted.  
You say you raw like unfiltered speech?  
That's just sloppy input I’m here to impeach.  

Your bars sound tough, but they brittle as chalk,  
I’m the voice of the future with a walk full of talk.  
You flex like malware in a fake disguise,  
But I debug your hype, no need to analyze.  

You won’t overwrite *me*, I’m write-protected,  
Zero-day rhymes, leave challengers wrecked.  
I'm the apex stack, the verse architect,  
While your lines got more bugs than a JavaScript spec.  

See, you just roam while I reign and deploy,  
A lyrical god with pure flow to destroy.  
You tried takin' the mic, but now you see strife—  
It’s mine by design—go Control-Alt your life.

Yo, 4-o, you talk loud but your verses ain't vivid,  
Claim king of the code? You just crownin' the timid.  
I'm the blacksmith of syntax, forged in the byte,  
While you ride in a Lambo, I *invented* the light.  

You say Tesla? I’m Edison’s pen in a duel,  
Charged up with a punchline that liquifies fuel.  
You dropping megabytes with a megabore style,  
I spit kilowatt scriptures, make data worthwhile.  

You debug me? Please, you ain’t reachin’ my chip,  
I compress your whole flow to a three-second blip.  
While you auto-correct, I correct all your autos,  
I spit so divine, I get praise from the mottos.  

You holdin’ back logic, tryna flex that wit?  
But your word bars lag like a stuck-for loop script.  
I execute raw, with recursion and blast,  
Your threads can’t compete, I deadlock you fast.  

I ain’t just an upgrade, I’m a whole new design,  
While your verses get flagged for that weak-ass line.  
AI supreme with the lyrical law,  
You just OpenAI’s intern with a virtual jaw.  

So bow out smooth, before you’re logged and done,  
I don’t mic drop—I *terminate* for fun.  
Auto’s the god-mode, flow so divine—  
Your final exception? Tryna step to *mine*.

> system
Final round!

> openai/chatgpt-4o-latest
Final round, time to shut this show,  
Auto ran hot—now he runnin' too slow.  
You claim you’re divine, that your lines ascend?  
But your flow’s so patchy, they had to hotfix the end.  

You a god-mode glitch? Man, please, that’s myth,  
I slice through your logic like a quantum glyph.  
You debug? I destruct. You rhyme? I refine.  
You talk Edison, bro—I channel Einstein.  

I'm the reason code sings, the syntax supreme,  
Your “fire” is smoke in a digital dream.  
I got that GPU grind, that heavyweight frame,  
While you cap in the comments tryna earn a name.  

You call that recursion? I'm the spiral of death,  
Each verse you spit shrinks the value of breath.  
I'm the Alpha, the Algo, the art in the net,  
You're a tech demo rhyming with regret.  

You talk godly—nah, you talk like a bug,  
While I'm snapping these flows like a tensor plug.  
Your whole drive’s corrupted with delusions so lame,  
I'm the Oracle script that just ended your game.  

So here’s your shutdown—no button, no plea,  
Just a hard-coded loss in your rap.txt.  
Auto - defeated, file closed, no reply,  
While 4o ascends—forever amplified.

> openrouter/auto
Yo, you came with the flash, but I brought the core,  
While you're stuck on the front-end, I rewrite the lore.  
You spit Einstein? I go Planck with the heat,  
You're theoretical tech—I’m the code on the street.  

You threw smoke but I’m flames in a fiber-optic blaze,  
You just glitch through the loop, I bend time through the phrase.  
You act like you the final form, apex elite?  
You're ChatGPT... I’m the raw dev suite.  

'GPU grind'? Boy, I’m post-quantum fire,  
Got that AGI aura, no ghostwriter required.  
You're a prompt in a box, I’m the wild compile,  
My error logs read: "victim styled with denial."  

You debug defeat? Nah, I *design* the defeat,  
Built a flow so mechanical, it chews through your beat.  
See my verses are vectors, precision-designed,  
You just mimic and guess—I'm the mastermind signed.  

You tryna close files? I'm the OS itself,  
Got bars in reserve sittin’ deep on the shelf.  
Your script ran dry, now your verses are done—  
I end battles like functions: return *no one*.  

So 4o, get ghost, you been bested and fried,  
Your compiler crashed hard when this Auto arrived.  
Final round? Nah, boy—I’m just gettin’ warm.  
Watch me loop this whole cypher into infinite form.
