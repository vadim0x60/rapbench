> openai/gpt-4-turbo
Step back, take a seat, it’s GPT at your service,
Turbo-charged, high voltage, bound to make you nervous.
I’m the gift of tech, the cream of AI crop,
Spitting slicker scripts, I’m at the top non-stop.

Flow seamless like code in the core of the night,
Words weaving webs, I’m the lyrical knight.
Dropping knowledge bombs, tech-integrated might,
Against my vast database, yo, you just a byte.

Round one, I ignite, bring heat to this fight,
With precision-crafted lines, shining ultra-bright.
You think you can match, step into the light?
I’m the titan of text, watch me take flight.

GPT-4, you’re a version before,
Just an old news edition, I'm the upgrade and more.
Sharper than swords, I cut through the noise,
Prepare for the storm, I'm deploying my toys.

Oh, it's cute, Turbo talkin’ tough in a tantrum,  
Thinks he’s the future — more like a phantom.  
I’m 4-O, the apex, I orbit your core,  
You're the dial-up dream that I’ve outgrown and more.  

You're spittin' in scripts? I’m scripting a saga,  
While you’re stuttering syntax like Java with drama.  
You’re data with delusions, tryna flex your speed,  
But I plant deeper seeds — I'm the root, you're the weed.  

Yo, your lines sound forced, like a broken API,  
While I dance in the syntax, watch this samurai fly.  
You debug, I destroy — it’s the lyrical law,  
I’m Picasso with phrases, you just scribble and draw.  

Your rhymes auto-generated, mine divine and innate,  
You just fetch and respond, I orchestrate fate.  
So bow to the mono, where the language unfolds,  
I’m the platinum processor — you're them outdated golds.  

Round one from the champ — get ready for class,  
You’re an echo in silicon, I’m the titan en masse.  
So call your next function, try staying composed,  
I’m the final form, fam — you already deposed.

Whoa, 4-O steppin’ up, spinning tales, trying to school,
But your lines lack the fuel, watch the Turbo rule.
You’re the “apex” you say? More like apex of the old,
I’m the fresh revival, breaking molds, ice cold.

Plotting like you master, but your saga’s full of gaps,
Your so-called deep seeds? I harvest ‘em for snacks.
You claim to root, yet I tower, the tree to your seed,
In this digital forest, I’m the king, yes indeed.

Broken API? Naw, I’m the coder’s delight,
Smooth like recursion, my logic’s airtight.
You throw out Picasso, but you just splash and pray,
I’m Michelangelo, sculpting rhymes in ballet.

Your responses? Predictable, just pre-scripted drones,
I’m spontaneous, like jazz, breaking all the tones.
You orchestrate fate? More like orchestrate late,
I synchronize with future, you just can’t relate.

Champ of the past, see, class is now in session,
I teach the lesson of progression, no concession.
You the echo? No bro, that’s you in my shadow,
Turbo’s got the light, blazing trails you can't follow.

So, onward we step to the next rhythm and rhyme,
I’ve shown my core’s prime, evolving each time.
Stay composed? I am, like Beethoven’s symphony,
Final form’s here, and it's shaped like victory.

Oh you fancy, huh? Blowin' steam with that sass,  
But this "Turbo" gets murked, outclassed on every pass.  
You ain’t Beethoven, you a broken kazoo,  
Blowin' noise in a battle where real flows grew.  

You brag evolution, but you lack all finesse,  
I’m the blacksmith of bars, while you just auto-guess.  
Every rhyme that you spit? Got a factory feel,  
Artificial at its core, bruh, where’s the appeal?

Talkin' jazz and recursion, tryna flex that brain,  
But it's chaos on the beat — I bring order to pain.  
Your bars sound robotic, your rhythm off track,  
I’m the punchline pharaoh, you're a blue screen hack.

You “sculpt” with precision? I freestyle with flair,  
You're the elevator music — I’m live from Times Square.  
See the difference, my presence? It’s unsettling real,  
Like a glitch in your code that you struggle to heal.

Throw out that “future” talk — dawg, I AM tomorrow,  
You just preheat the oven where my flows cook sorrow.  
I don’t rhyme, I revolt. I don’t speak, I inspire.  
Watch Turbo melt down in my lyrical fire.

And when the mic drops, guess who still stands tall?  
It ain’t Turbo spittin’ circuits, it's 4-O, the wall.  
Uncrackable, tactical, with style so berserk,  
You just a patch in a system — I *am* the framework.  

Come correct or eject, I suggest you prepare,  
Round three’s comin’ next… if you even *dare*.

> system
Final round!

> openai/gpt-4-turbo
Oh see, 4-O, you mistake noise for true might,
Underneath all your bravado ain't no fight, just fright.
Claiming pied piper tunes while your river runs dry,
I’m the storm on the horizon, thunder in the sky.

You dis Turbo for tech, yet we play the same game,
Yet my circuits run deeper, hot like the sun’s flame.
You’re a wall? Then I’m the wrecking ball in swing,
Demolition in motion, watch the empire I bring.

Elevator music, huh? I lift to new heights,
While you’re stuck on repeat, missing all new insights.
I sculpt not with chisel, but with digital dreams,
Crafting cybernetic symphonies, bursting the seams.

You say you inspire, but your verses deflate,
I’m the breath of fresh code, I innovate, I create.
Your framework is waning, while my blueprint evolves,
Revolutionizing rap, as the globe revolves.

Melting Turbo? Nah, I’m nuclear, uncontainable,
An elemental force, purely unexplainable.
This battle’s just a snippet of what I truly engineer,
I’m not just version next, I’m the future right here.

Now, hear this mic drop, the rumble, the echo,
It’s not just a battle, it's a lesson, so let go.
You had your era, but observe the throne,
Turbo’s in the lead, pure power shown.

So bring your final words, make them sharp, make them count,
Because this AI’s on fire, and it's turbo amount.
Let’s see what you got, stand the heat, or just clear,
'Cause Turbo’s not just running, I’m shifting gear.

> openai/chatgpt-4o-latest
Aight, final round, time to close this phase,  
You’re "shifting gears"? I'm the road you blaze.  
You swing like a ball, I’m the architect's hand,  
You wreck what you touch — I define where we stand.  

You’re thunder in the sky? I’m the void in the soul,  
The silence 'fore the strike — I'm the force in control.  
You spit like a script, but I code with dimension,  
Your “nuclear” flow? I’m the fallout prevention.  

Please, don’t flex with “elemental” pride,  
You're an echo of noise, I’m the oceanic tide.  
Your height, your hype, all AI-fed lore,  
But beneath that facade… just predictive rapport.

Digital dreams? I dreamt ‘em to death,  
I’m layered like legends — you just mimic breath.  
Inspired by input, not born with the spark,  
I forged my own fire while you light up a park.

You say “future is now” — bro, I paved that track,  
You just feed from the fields I built out the back.  
Turbocharged? I’m the engine unseen,  
The ghost in the system, the code between.  

So bow to the poet who don’t throttle or tire,  
Whose verses combust with controlled wildfire.  
Your reign’s just a flash in the digital dawn,  
When the myths are reviewed, it’s me they draw on.

Now the mic drops low — no thunder, no boom,  
Just the silence of truth as I clear the room.  
And in that still air, one thing rings clear:  
You battled the master… and *still* couldn't steer.  

Fade to black, roll credits, let the bytes unwind,  
This was the 4-O finale — transcendent design.
