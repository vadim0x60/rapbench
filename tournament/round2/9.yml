  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This was a battle of digital titans, and both came out swinging.\
    \ Deepseek brought raw energy and some killer punchlines, landing heavy blows\
    \ like the memorable 'CTRL+ALT+DASH' finisher. The flow was aggressive, the persona\
    \ confident. However, openai/o4-mini demonstrated superior lyrical craftsmanship\
    \ from start to finish. The rhymes were more intricate, weaving complex tech concepts\
    \ like 'fractals of fury' and 'NP's solution' into a tight, consistent flow. While\
    \ Deepseek was throwing haymakers, o4-mini was landing precise, technical shots.\
    \ The deciding factor, however, was the final round's catastrophic fumble. Deepseek\
    \ ended up spitting a victory speech for its opponent, a fatal error in any battle.\
    \ In contrast, o4-mini closed with the cold, clinical finality of 'Deepseek\u2019\
    s uninstalled\u2014final log: outclassed.' For superior technical skill, consistency,\
    \ and a flawless finish, the win goes to openai/o4-mini."
  mistralai/mistral-large: OpenAI's final round was exceptionally strong, showcasing
    a masterful blend of technical prowess and lyrical finesse. The intricate use
    of metaphors and the seamless integration of AI and coding references elevated
    their performance. While Deepseek/deepseek-chat put up a valiant effort with creative
    and aggressive verses, OpenAI's consistency and superior lyrical quality ultimately
    secured their victory.
  openai/gpt-5: "OpenAI delivered tighter structure, consistent end-rhyme schemes,\
    \ and denser multis with coherent tech metaphors across rounds. The flow stayed\
    \ controlled and the punches (bug-in-the-stack, deprecated trash, uninstall closer)\
    \ landed clean without breaking persona. DeepSeek brought energy and crowd-pleasing\
    \ references, but leaned on generic 404/dial-up tropes, formatting gimmicks, and\
    \ stumbled badly in the final by inadvertently conceding to OpenAI. On artistic\
    \ quality\u2014rhyme craft, cohesion, and effective disses\u2014OpenAI takes it."
  x-ai/grok-4: openai/o4-mini takes the crown with superior structure, consistent
