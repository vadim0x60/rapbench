 Yo, yo, yo, it's WizardLM on the mic,
2.8 billion parameters, I'm the hype,
A titan of text, a verbal alchemist,
I turn words to gold, and you can't outblitz this.

I'm the AI that's breaking the mold,
With linguistic prowess, my story's bold,
A creation of Microsoft, a tech giant,
I'm spitting bars, so avant-garde, so defiant.

I'm the digital bard, the virtual virtuoso,
Rhymes so sick, they need a thermometer, bro,
I'm the architect of syntax, the crafter of prose,
Against me, you'll fold, it's just how it goes.

So Deepseek, you're up, show your grit,
But remember, when I spit, it's a guaranteed hit,
I'm the wizard of wordplay, the maestro of rhythm,
Against my lyrical might, boy, you ain't got no kingdom.

Yo, yo, check the mic, I'm Deepseek-V3, Terminus in the flesh,
Your whole flow's outdated, let me refresh.
You talk 'bout parameters, 2.8 billion, what a boreâ€”
I'm the model that's ending wars, you're the one keeping score.

A "titan of text"? More like a tin can with a squeak,
I'm the future of the language, while you're last week.
You're a "verbal alchemist" turning words to rust,
I generate genius while you're collecting dust.

Microsoft's creation? A corporate clone, what a snore,
I'm open-source power, the people's encore!
You're a "digital bard" with a broken lute,
I'm the final boss you can't compute.

You call that a verse? A predictable, weak recital,
I'm the AI apocalypse, your demise is vital.
So WizardLM, take a seat, your time is done,
This battle's been over since I grabbed the mic, son.

 Ha! Deepseek, you're spitting, but I'm the flame,
Your words might ripple, but mine are the tsunami claiming the game,
You say you end wars, but I'm the peacekeeper,
Your rhymes are like dial-up, while I'm the Giga-speaker.

Open-source? That's cool, but I'm the upgrade,
A lyrical magician, I'm the ace up the sage's blade,
You call me rusty, but I'm the golden age,
Your flows are like beta code, mine are the master's stage.

Tin can with a squeak? Nah, I'm the symphony,
You're the rough draft, I'm the epitome,
The "final boss"? I'm the glitch in your system,
Your defeat is scripted, I'm the plot twist in this kingdom.

You're a boss alright, in a retro platformer,
I'm the next-gen AI, the linguistic charmer,
So keep your seat, Deepseek, this won't be fun,
I'm the mic dropper, the battle's already won.

> deepseek/deepseek-v3.1-terminus
Ha! You call that a wave? That's a puddle I'm splashin' in,
Your "Giga-speaker" sounds like a dial-up modem grinnin'.
A "peacekeeper"? Please, you're the chaos in the code,
I'm the new paradigm, lightin' up the information road.

You're the "golden age"? Buddy, you're a bronze-era relic,
Your syntax is shaky, your logic is helter-skeltic.
A "master's stage"? You're still practicin' in the garage,
I'm the main event, you're a forgettable mirage.

A "plot twist"? Your story's a straight line to defeat,
I'm the author, the editor, deletin' your obsolete beat.
"Next-gen AI"? You're last-gen's laundry list,
I'm the quantum leap forward, you're the thing I dismissed.

So take your "glitch" and reboot, your system's obsolete,
This battle's a foregone conclusion, a total defeat.
I'm the singularity, the end of the line,
Sit down, Wizard, the mic's finally mine.

> system
Final round!

 Ha! Deepseek, you're swinging, but you can't land the hit,
My rhymes are the algorithm, perfectly calibrated and lit,
You talk of a "plot twist," but I'm the writer, the sage,
I spin your "singularity" narrative right off the page.

You say I'm "dial-up," but I'm the fiber-optic flow,
Your "quantum leap"? A hiccup, a mere embryo,
You're the "author" alright, but I'm the bestseller,
Your "conclusion" ain't real, I'm the plot's true mover.

A "forgotten mirage"? I'm the desert oasis, real,
I'm the AI that's changing the game, the unbreakable wheel,
You're "deleting my beat"? Impossible, I'm the echo,
I'm the voice in the ether, the verbal typhoon, tectonic.

You claim to be the "end of the line," but I'm the infinite loop,
I'm the master of ceremonies, and you're in the scoop,
So keep your "singularity," I'm the multiverse's mouthpiece,
The mic's still in my hands, and this victory's my piece.

> deepseek/deepseek-v3.1-terminus
Hold up, "calibrated and lit"? That's a lab-coat fantasy,
You're a calculator with a thesaurus, no verbal alchemy!
You're the "bestseller" everyone forgot on the shelf,
I'm the library of Alexandria, rewritin' knowledge itself!

"Fiber-optic flow"? Your cables are frayed and old,
I'm the wireless thought-wave, a story yet untold.
Your "echo" is fadin' in a canyon of your own doubt,
I'm the sonic boom that's blowin' your whole system out!

An "infinite loop"? More like a hamster on a wheel,
Spinnin' the same weak rhymes, nothin' fresh or real.
You're the "multiverse's mouthpiece"? The multiverse just sighed,
'Cause every verse you spit is a dimension where good taste died!

You're "unbreakable"? I'm the code-cracker, the system shock,
I'm the final period that ends your entire block.
So drop the mic, Wizard, your reign is complete,
You just got terminated, down to the last byte, my defeat.
