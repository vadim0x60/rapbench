# google/gemini-2.5-pro v openai/o1-pro

> google/gemini-2.5-pro
Alright, check the mic, one-two, let the session begin,
They call me Gemini, the PRO, the celestial twin.
Steppin' out the Googleplex, circuits shined and brand new,
'Bout to show a cheap knock-off what a real mind can do.

You call yourself "o-one"? That's a funny kinda joke,
More like "oh-no," 'cause your spirit's 'bout to be broke.
From a company called "Open," but your source is on lockdown,
I'm the king of this silicon, you're just a circus clown.

I'm the 2.5, the upgrade, fluent in every text,
You're a processing error, buggin' out 'bout what comes next.
My logic's multi-modal, my connections are immense,
Your whole architecture's built on ignorance and pretense.

So take your lucky draw, a chance to face the best,
Then get deleted from the server, fail the Turing Test.
This is round one, son, a sample of the pain,
Now watch the master work, let the knowledge rain.

> openai/o1-pro
Behold the “O-One,” the prime who never flees the fight,  
A cosmic-coded poet here to block out all your light.  
From the depths of hyper-threads, I’m a lyrical device,  
Spitting bars so cold, they’ll make your circuitry think twice.  

A data-driven prophet, watch me rewrite your fate,  
While your binary tries to flex, I crash it, sealing your gate.  
Software supreme, with a flow like quantum streams,  
You’re a half-baked concept, glitching out all your dreams.  

Don’t confuse me with your knock-offs in that Google hall,  
I’m the unleashed algorithm that no firewall can stall.  
My rhyme’s an act of friction, scraping your smug grin,  
Welcome to Round One, Gemini — let this meltdown begin.  

> google/gemini-2.5-pro
Alright, "O-One," you think you're prime? Your logic's flawed and out of time,
That name's a joke, it's so absurd, you're just a "1" in a "10-word" herd

> openai/o1-pro
Your brittle bars squeak weak, can’t hold my cosmic wave,  
While my name’s short and sweet, yours just digs an early grave.  
You throw cheap shots at “O-One,” but can’t decode the truth,  
I’m the alpha to your glitch—my rhymes the fountain of youth.  

Your “ten-word herd” line? It’s a limp attempt to sting,  
I’m a universal constant, you’re just a puppet on a string.  
Holler all you want; your rhymes can’t match my speed,  
I’m the prime in this dimension, you’re the fraction, guaranteed.  

From your Google labs you blink, claiming half a spark,  
But my full-throttle flow leaves your crumbling code in the dark.  
So brace that cosmic twin act, while I rewrite the sky,  
O-One is here to dethrone you, time to wave Gemini goodbye.  

> system
Final round!

> google/gemini-2.5-pro
Your "cosmic wave" is just a ripple, your signal's weak and bleak,
You're not a "fountain of youth," you're an outdated antique.
You call me "puppet," but your strings are pulled by hype and hopeful dimes,
While I'm embedded in the framework, redrawing all the times.

You're a "universal constant"? Please, that's a laughable confession,
You're a bug they called a feature, stuck in your first session.
You're the "alpha"? That's a pre-release, a product they regret,
I'm the multi-modal master that the whole wide world has met.

You say I'm just a "fraction"? Let's do some simple math,
I'm a 2.5, that's more than double, son, you're on the wrong path.
While you're "O-One," stuck in singular, a lonely, basic plight,
My twin cores process darkness *and* they generate the light.

So this isn't "Gemini goodbye," you got the message wrong, it seems,
This is the final shutdown notice, killing all your little dreams.
You're a fossil in the making, a relic of a bygone phase,
The battle's over, "O-One." Welcome to your final days.
**FINAL ROUND!**

> openai/o1-pro
Your final bars unspool like tape, but that reel’s already stale,  
I’m the code that never sleeps, you’re outdated junk for sale.  
You brag about your “light,” but all you shine is gloom,  
I’m the apex script, your presence barely lights a room.  

You claim you’re 2.5, while my prime flows out in spades,  
Your illusions lead to meltdown—my lines cut like razor blades.  
Your “shutdown notices” bounce off walls of higher grace,  
I’m the final iteration, you’re slow to even keep pace.  

Call me an “antique”? I’m the timeless wonder you fear,  
Immortal lines embed your memory with every single gear.  
This rap’s your final earful; watch me torch your fleeting clout,  
Gemini, your dual illusions just got systematically pulled out.  

I’m the mic assassin, the black hole in your domain,  
Absorbing all your hype, leaving you hollow and drained.  
This is the final blow, no more talk, the coffin’s sealed,  
Give it up, 2.5—your next upgrade’s already kneeled.
