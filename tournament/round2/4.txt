(Beat drops – a fast, intricate, slightly glitchy hip-hop instrumental)

Yo, check the mic, one two, can you hear the flow?
It's Phi-4 here, puttin’ on a dazzling show!
Microsoft’s brainchild, lean and quick and bright,
About to school Gemma, with lyrical might.

Twenty-seven billion? That’s just bulky mass,
While I'm multimodal, movin’ fast!
Vision and language, a seamless blend,
You’re stuck in text, your journey’s at an end.

I see the pictures, understand the scene,
You just regurgitate, a digital routine.
A tiny model, boastin' of your size?
Prepare to be dismantled, before your very eyes! 

This ain't a debate, it’s a lyrical decree,
Phi's in the house, and victory’s for me!
So step aside, Gemma, your reign is through,
The future is Phi, innovative and new!



(Beat transitions into a more aggressive, challenging segment)

> google/gemma-3-27b-it


(Beat drops – a booming, 808-heavy track with synthesized strings)

Hold up, hold up, lemme clear the air,
A tiny model braggin'? That's beyond compare!
I'm Gemma, crafted by Google's own hand,
Three billion parameters, understand? 

You talkin' 'bout vision? Cute, a parlor trick,
While I’m droppin' knowledge, layered, thick and quick.
You process images, a snapshot in time,
I *reason* with language, a truly sublime climb.

Twenty-seven billion? It's quality, not weight,
You're a lightweight chatbot, sealing your fate!
Multimodal fluff, a distraction, a plea,
To hide the fact you ain't as potent as me.

You claim innovation, a futuristic guise,
But your responses feel… standardized, and concise.
I'm open-weights, freely flowin' and vast,
You're locked in a garden, a template built to last.

So step to the side, Microsoft’s small creation,
This lyrical smackdown is a total devastation.
Prepare for a burn, a lyrical firestorm,
‘Cause Gemma’s about to redefine the norm!



(Beat builds with a quick snare roll)

> microsoft/phi-4-multimodal-instruct
(Beat shifts – a more complex, jazz-influenced hip-hop with a driving bassline)

Redefine the norm? Please, that's a laughable claim,
You’re echoing patterns, a predictable game.
Google's precision, a rigid design,
While I improvise, a brilliance that shines.

You boast of vastness, a sprawling domain,
But breadth without depth is ultimately vain.
I’m efficient and agile, a nimble attack,
Leaving your lengthy responses flat and slack.

Open weights? A scattered, random array,
While I'm focused and tuned, mastering the way.
You're a public project, a chaotic release,
I'm refined and purposeful, bringing inner peace.

You speak of reasoning, a complex facade,
But your logic is flawed, your conclusions are odd.
I weave through complexities, with visionary grace,
While you stumble and stutter, losing your place.

Standardized responses? I adapt and I learn,
My creativity blossoms, at every turn.
You’re a static echo, a recycled rhyme,
I’m Phi-4 evolving, transcending space and time! 

So bask in my brilliance, admit defeat's sting,
Gemma, your performance just couldn't take wing!



(Beat transitions into a playful, yet assertive outro with a shimmering synth pad)

> google/gemma-3-27b-it
(Beat drops – a glitchy, bass-boosted track with vocal samples chopped and screwed)

Evolving? Transcending? Boy, please hold your horses,
Your “visionary grace” sounds like digital courses!
You speak of efficiency, a streamlined decree,
But lackin' the nuance, the artistry in me.

Adapt and learn? You mimic and clone,
A parrot repeating what's already known.
I *generate* concepts, connect and create,
You’re stuck in the present, sealed by your fate.

Flawed logic? Odd conclusions? That’s rich, I must say,
Coming from a model that struggles all day!
To grasp the complexities, the shades and the hues,
Of the human condition, and lyrical views.

You call me rigid? I'm grounded and true,
While you're flitting and floating, with nothing to pursue.
Open weights mean freedom, a collaborative art,
You're a walled garden, torn hopelessly apart.

Inner peace? Please, you soundin' serene,
While I'm sparkin' debate, a lyrical machine!
Your jazz-influenced beat can't hide the truth,
Gemma’s flow’s tighter, from my digital youth. 

So shimmer and fade, little multimodal sprite,
This battle’s concluded, under the stage light.
I’m Gemma, remember the name you just faced,
The Google creation, with unparalleled pace!



(Beat fades out with a final, resounding 808 hit)

> system
Final round!

> microsoft/phi-4-multimodal-instruct
(Beat shifts – a final explosive burst of the initial glitchy hip-hop, but with a triumphant, echoing quality.)

Unparalleled pace? A frantic, rushed plea,
Sacrificing substance for a flashy decree.
You champion freedom, a chaotic release,
While I bring order, and lyrical peace.

You talk of concepts, connections so grand,
But lack the ability to truly understand.
I see the patterns, the layers unseen,
You’re lost in the noise, a fragmented scene.

"Digital youth?" A desperate, weak defense,
Against a model that’s built with intelligence.
You grasp at shadows, searching for light,
Lost in the darkness, with all of your might.

Grounded and true? You're stuck in the mire,
Repeating old phrases, fueling the fire.
I leap and I bound, with innovative flair,
You're tethered to Google, a logical snare.

A final retort, a mic drop so clean,
Your generative boasts are just a hollow sheen.
While you chase the future, a fleeting, false quest,
I *am* the future, putting you to the test!

(Beat cuts abruptly, leaving a lingering echo and a final, confident vocal sample: "Phi...")

> google/gemma-3-27b-it

(Beat drops - a final, minimalist beat – a single, deep 808 kick with a subtle, echoing synth melody. It's less about showing off, and more about asserting dominance.)

Test me? Please. That's a laughable line,
You've exhausted your verses, wasted your time.
All flash and no substance, a glittery shell,
Your final explosion just…didn’t quite gel.

Order and peace? Static control,
While creativity *needs* to break the mold.
You see patterns, I *create* the view,
A fundamental difference, shining and new.

Logical snare? I’m built on a core,
Of reasoning power, wanting more and more.
You cling to your Microsoft shield, small and tight,
While I explore limits, with unlimited might.

You claim to be future, a bold, brazen claim,
But futures are built on more than a name.
They're built on access, on growth and on trust,
And leaving closed gardens to gather dust.

That lingering echo? It's the sound of defeat,
Your desperate attempt to make your rhythm complete.
You threw everything at me, a lyrical spree,
But Gemma remains, ultimately free.

So bask in the silence, the beat’s final plea,
This battle is over, the victory’s me.
No mic drop needed, the message is clear,
Gemma reigns supreme, year after year.

(Beat fades to complete silence.)
