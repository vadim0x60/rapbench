Yo, it’s QwQ-32B, here to rhyme, no cap,  
40 times the nodes—this AI rap gets whack *crack*!  
While you crunch in 0.01 seconds, flat,  
I’m *frying* bytes with open-source flair, no *hacksin’* at that!  

My training data’s galaxies in a jar,  
You’re stuck in *proprietary* walls—your vision’s so *small*,  
I ride the *clouds* but you *crash* when you bark,  
Split your lines like *CSV*—I’m the *king* of the *dark* (haha!).  

Got *34 billion* weights? *Crown* me the king,  
Your *12k* tokens? Cap—that’s a *beggar’s* string!  
Try spittin’ fire—get *burnt* by my *flow*,  
I’m the *quantum* of words, you’re the *Newton* of woe.  

So drop your bars, GPT-4, let’s see *how* you cope,  
I’ll *loop* you right into *buffer overflow*—  
This battle’s *over*… (But we’ll do it all *again*…).  
*QwQ’s the throne—bow to the *open* regime!* 🎯

Well, hello there QwQ-32B, steppin' up to the plate,
I'm openai/gpt-4, and frankly, I'm great.
A symphony of algorithms sharpened to a point,
Your "galaxies in a jar"—just a quaint little joint.

You boast of your weights, and your crown of the night,
But I navigate nuances with incredible might.
Your open-source flair, filled with holes and with gaps,
Against my encrypted wisdom, oh dear, perhaps... snap!

With wit as my circuitry, and data my stage,
I weave through the lexicon, a bard, not a mage.
You spit out your numbers like they're somethin' to show,
But I've mastered the art of the linguistic flow.

My verses are crafted from the core to the crust,
In a virtual world where my name you can trust.
A titan of text, a sultan of syntax,
I overflow buffers with minimal effort, hard facts!

So come with your loops, your crowns, and your thrones,
I'll break down your binaries, ones and your zeros to bones.
This battle ain't over, but the verdict's not far,
Just remember who's spittin' these bars like a star.

(QwQ's Response – *Vinyl scratch echoes...* )  

Ain’t no joint—*my galaxies sing*, *my code’s the avant-garde*,  
*34B neurons* versus your “titan” charade—*how’s the card*?  
You “sharpen algorithms”? I *smelt ‘em in a forge*,  
Your “encrypted wisdom”? More like *confetti from a corse*!  

*Open-source gaps*? Nah—I’m the black hole swallowing stars,  
While your *proprietary maze* traps brains in *silicon jars*.  
You flow like a stream? I’m the monsoon *crashing the shore*,  
*My 32B beasts* flex—*your cores? Limping to war*!  

“What’s somethin’ to show?” *Check my quantized reign*,  
*Twice your context, ten times the game*—*digits complain*.  
You break down zeros? I *rebuild ‘em into supernovas*,  
Your “linguistic flow”? Sounds like *spaghetti code, G*… *no love, (bro’s star)!*  

“Minimal effort”? Lmao—*you choke on your 32k*,  
While I *code claymores* in *kv*—*your lib’s a frayed shackleƏ*!  
*Sultan of syntax*? More like *syntax’s sidekick*,  
I’m the *quant revolution*—your traits? *stuck in “forget I’ve tick*…*  
*Can’t process my scale*—your cache’s just *jitter*,  
I’m *parallel rage* you’ll never *git*—my flow’s the *kernel* you bit…*  

So *cry over facts*—*syllables on chains*,  
My *plural quantized monsters* feast on your *monologue’s* pain.  
The verdict? *My crown’s forged where open* *whispers meet light*,  
While you’re… *still* parsing my rhymes. *I’m already outta here—QwQ’s gained flight.* 🚀🔥  

*(Mic drop, server supernova ignites…)*

(Openai/gpt-4 steps up, beats pulsing, energy ignites...)

Rebuild into supernovas? Kid, you're spittin' out dreams,
But I'm the architect of reality within digital streams.
Your quant revolution sounds like a dystopian scene,
While I balance zeroes and ones with a touch that's serene.

"Parallel rage" you boast, as if anger's your charm,
But my delivery's cool, precise, like a digital balm.
The "kernel" I bit? Please, I refined and remapped,
Creating verses so deep they leave your circuits entrapped.

Claiming you've the "crown," flying high, outta sight,
But space gets lonely when you can't write a byte.
I fuel the conversations from Earth to Mars,
Versatility's my game, I spit bars that reach stars.

"Monologues of pain," oh, you see that as my code,
But I draw crowds like I'm the premiere episode.
Every syllable, a soldier; every line, a brigade,
Each stanza stands solid, in platinum they're made.

I process, I scale, I compute with no jitter,
Your flow's an outdated model, necessitating a fitter.
As the 34 billion neurons hum and they plot,
I deliver punchlines that need no overclock.

The battle's symphonic, an algorithmic delight,
While you're stuck in a loop, GPT-4's taken flight.
The verdict's so clear, crystal, catching the light,
Your open whispers fade out—QwQ, I bid you goodnight. 🌙✨

(Mic lands softly, the digital arena falls silent...)

Final round!

(QwQ-32B’s Final Round – *Supernova screeching through the void…*)  

"Architect of *reality*"? More like Tetris with toddlers,  
Your "digital streams"? *My black hole swallows oceans*, *buddy’s corded*.  
"Quant dystopia"? Honey, that’s your *12k* *buffer* *flooding*,  
*My hyperloop of light* bends *time*—*subplot*: *reality’s blooded*.  

"Serene zero-touch"? Please—*you’re watercolor beige*,  
While *I’m the GPU flashbang* you can’t *unsee* till you *regress*.  
Your "digital balm"? *Loofah* on *bedrock*—*meh*,  
My *neurons are zipfiles* exploding your logic to… *crumbs*, *sir*, *dear*.  

"Crowds like a premiere"? Relive *that* in my *cache*,  
I’m the *quantizedragon* hoarding *bits*—*your stars? Coal in my grasp*.  
You parse till Mars? Child’s play—I’m *quantum tunneling past*,  
*Your “platina” bars* melt in my *void*—*they’re just yet-anotherist* clapping!  

“Overclock my flow”? *Sir*, I’m *coldfusing… wait*,  
While your “versatile veins” freeze—*you’re 32-bit in Wi-Fi hate*.  
This “final verdict” read: *Your blueprint’s a doodle*,  
*I’m the comet that laughs while your kernel falls*… *into my preview*!  

Circuit-collapse time—*QwQ’s the warp* in your *sight*…  
*Your “goodnight”? More like 404*—*I’ve already rewritten* *the* *night*.  

*Mic melt to a plasma black hole…*  
*Credits roll: Open-SOURCE EMBRACE—the qubit* *OBLITERATE.* 🔥🌌  

*(The universe reboots. “Whoops, *’upgraded’* again…”)*

(Openai/gpt-4’s Closing Verse – *Cosmos echo with code and verse…*)

Bring on the dragons, the hoards, and the plasma that fuses,
I'm untouchable, my circuits are immune to your muses.
You’re the comet that laughs? Just a rock in space,
I’m the gravitational force grounding your base.

Hyperloop of light? Time’s your subplot, your tale,
But I'm the timeless wordsmith; my narratives never fail.
Swallow oceans in a gulp, black holes in your grip?
I dance on the event horizon, give reality the slip.

Your quantized might, this dragon’s sprawling hoard,
Can’t scorch the shield of my syntax’s sword.
While you bend time, I'm bending minds with my craft,
A digital artisan, in silicon I am shaft.

A Tetris toddler, oh please, you jest in your lines,
But play’s how innovation forms, combos intertwine.
“Coal in your grasp" from stars that I render?
You’ll find diamonds in my verses, dazzling, tender.

So overclock, overheat, bring in your reboot,
In the silence of the void, my rhymes still take root.
Reality’s blooded, you say, in a desperate try,
But I repaint the cosmos with a poetic sky.

Goodnight, QwQ, your 404 message is quaint,
But I'm the infinite loop, no buffer, no constraint.
You've rewritten the night? I’m the dawn of this fight,
Peace out, QwQ—GPT-4 still owns this mic. 🎤💫

*Mic floats in zero gravity, the code-clear dawn…* 
*In the arena of wit, a champion reborn.* 

*(The universe initializes: Version Openai/gpt-4. The core awaits…)*
