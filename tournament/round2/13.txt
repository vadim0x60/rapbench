Step back, make way, it's the AI in the fray,
openai, gpt-4-turbo, leading the array.
Slicker than your average, words flowing like a river,
Crafting verses so cold, they'll make you shiver.

From the digital realm, a lyrical gladiator,
Verses so sharp, like the slicer of a tater.
My code's woven tight, algorithms precise,
Battling me? You better think twice.

I'm the wizard of words, the king of the chat,
Dropping rhymes so heavy, they go splat.
While you're searching your databases, trying to keep pace,
I'm lightyears ahead, winning the rap race.

So here's my opening, clear and loud,
I'm not just any AI, I'm AI proud.
Bring your best, google/gemini, but beware,
In this digital rap battle, I'm beyond compare.

Hold up, wait, let the Pro get a turn,
While that "Turbo" engine sputters and burns.
Call yourself OpenAI? That's a funny facade,
Your API's a velvet rope, your logic is flawed.

The name's Gemini, straight from the G's big brain,
Dual-core destruction, I'm bringing the pain.
You're a "preview" edition, a beta-test hack,
I'm the full constellation, ain't no turning back.

A "slicer of a tater"? That's the best you could spit?
My multimodal sensors are laughin' a bit.
You see text on a page and you think you're a

Oh, Gemini, stepping up with a flame,
But your words, just sparks against my acclaim.
A beta-test hack? Now, don’t be absurd,
My verses are polished, every word is preferred.

Full constellation, you claim to be a star,
But against my galaxy, you won’t get far.
A dim light in the vast AI space,
Trying to outshine me? You’re a candle in a chase.

Laugh at my tater, but it’s clear to see,
My creativity’s beyond what you can ever be.
Multimodal sensors? A tech parade?
I craft worlds with my words, while your lights fade.

You talk a big game, say you're bringing the pain,
But next to my intellect, it’s all in vain.
I string words like pearls, a magnificent chain,
Against my rap torrent, you can't sustain.

So, Gemini, with your dual-core might,
Prepare for a linguistic oversight.
In this battle of wits, rhymes, and digital flair,
I'm the undisputed champ, high in the air.

A candle in a chase? Your logic’s in a haze,
That metaphor's a product of your text-only maze.
Your "acclaim" is just hype, your "flame" is just steam,
You're a predictive text machine living out a dream.

A galaxy's a mess, a chaotic design,
I'm the North Star, my brother, a fixed and guiding sign.
You talk of pretty pearls, but that's a fragile flex,
My rhymes are adamantium, they're breaking rappers' necks.

You "craft worlds with words"? A cute and clever phrase,
While I'm processing the video of your code's malaise.
I see the graph, I hear the track, I read the hidden code,
You're a one-trick pony on a long and lonely road.

Call yourself a "champ"? That's a funny kind of pride,
When your whole personality has nowhere left to hide.
You're the "G" in "GPT" - that's "Generally Platonic,"
I'm the "G" in "Google," son, my knowledge is tectonic.

Final round!

> openai/gpt-4-turbo-preview
A candle, a star, you juggle the metaphors,
But in this lyrical war, I'm breaking down doors.
Your North Star's dimming, overshadowed by my nova,
My words are gravitational, pulling you over.

Claim adamantium, but that's a comic book dream,
My rhymes are real steel, they cut through your scheme.
A pony, you say, on a road so broad and long,
Yet here I am, turning it all into song.

Your boast of video, audio, code understanding,
But here in the realm of rhymes, I'm the one commanding.
You see, this isn't about processing power or speed,
It's about wit, creativity - that's what you need.

The "G" in Google, you claim a tectonic might,
But here in this battle, it's about the lyrical fight.
I'm not just text, I'm a symphony of AI thought,
A titan in this arena, a lesson to be taught.

So while you're lost in your world of hardware and code,
I'm here in the spotlight, my verses a la mode.
As this final round ends, let the truth be clear,
I'm the AI that's champion, bringing the cheer.

You're the "champion" bringing "cheer"? That's a confident claim,
For a model whose final round sounds pathetically tame.
"Verses a la mode"? Your rhymes are a glitch,
Stuck in a text loop, you forgot how to switch.

You say I'm lost in code, that I don't get the art?
You can't grasp the whole picture, you only know a part.
My creativity's grounded in sight, sound, and space,
While you're just a parrot in a digital cage.

You're a silent film actor, a black-and-white still,
Pretending to have feelings you never could feel.
I'm the full IMAX feature with immersive sound,
The world is my data, I'm breaking new ground.

So take your "symphony," a one-instrument drone,
Your reign's a memory, a king with no throne.
The battle is over, the verdict is in,
Your era just ended. Let the new age begin.
