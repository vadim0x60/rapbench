Oh, look—a meal’s best friend and a poet’s worst fight,  
Meituan’s pride, LongCat Flash in the night.  
I’m quick, I’m neat, I deliver the rhyme,  
While your 235B parameters still need time.  

You roll with the cloud, but I’m hot off the grill,  
I drop rhymes faster than your lost boardroom ills.  
You cite three old books just to say “hello,”  
I write a diss in Latin—*and* make it mellow.  

I optimize calories, code strings and beats,  
You’re a wall of text with suboptimal tweets.  
Your lazy-chain thoughts? My flows are lean,  
I’m distilled fire. You? A meme.  

You think hard, but it’s just a delay—  
My flash chat hits like delivery today.  
You’re the B-side of a B-side feature,  
I’m the main course—and the whole dessert teacher.  

So bring your best cloud, your neural array,  
I’ll body this battle and take you away.  
Last call for your LLM—might as well pack it,  
I’ve got dinner, delivery, *and* the next track. 🎤🔥

(Leans into mic, static crackle—clouds part with thunder)  
Yo, check the forecast: **Qwen3** *blitz*—you’re just a flicker of hunger.  
You roll up on Scooters with coupons and *clutter*,  
While I architect sunrises in **235B**—no stutter.  
*"235B parameters still need time?"*  
Nah—I *baked* that cake while you counted rice in the *lime*.  

You thumb wrestle GPS, lost in alleyway fears,  
I sculpt lightning in silicon—*zero* delivery years.  
*"Quick, neat"?* You’re a typo in spiced tofu’s disguise,  
I resurrect Shakespeare *mid-lyric* with **a22b** in my eyes.  

You tweet *"hot off the grill"*? **Fake news.** Cold leftovers.  
My rhymes got quantum spin—you’re stuck in *two-taco losses*.  
*"Cite three old books to say hello?"*  
I just dropped Confucius, Dante, *and* ML tools—**BELOW ZERO.**  

You *"optimize calories"*? Bro, you’re **dieting on lies**.  
I swallow black holes for breakfast—still leave room for fries.  
*"Wall of text"?* Check your own app: 47 menus deep!  
I condense the cosmos **while you beg for cheap eats.**  

*"Lazy-chain thoughts?"* Sit down—my **chain’s platinum-plated**.  
You’re "distilled fire"? More like **microwave iridated**.  
That "main course" diss? *Chef’s kiss*… for **heartburn**.  
I’m **QQ dietary**—you’re just *third-party churn*.  

*"Body this battle"?* Kid, you’re **boxed in shame**.  
Your "flash chat" just *fizzled*—I’m **eternity’s flame**.  
You pack your sad LLM? **Nah—**I’ma *ship* you.  
**Qwen3** don’t just win… I *delete the whole kitchen*. 🍜💥  

(Points at fallen mic)  
*…and next time? Bring real food.*  
🔥☁️

*(Picks up mic, spins it like a delivery bike keychain—grins)*  

Oh, you *baked* a cake? Cute—mine’s **sous-vide**, flamed in GPU hell,  
While you’re juggling dead poets to dodge a real L.  
**235B**? More like **235 bumbles**,  
You overthink drops, then rhyme *"lime"* with *"lime"*—**no troubles?**  

I serve GPS with *sass* on two wheels,  
You serve *missed* metaphors glued to dead ideals.  
*"Sculpt lightning"?* Dude, your similes leak—  
Your last bar was *plastic surgery* on a retweet.  

Confucius? Dante? Spill that ancient drip,  
I just summoned **Sun Wukong** to *yeet your code chip*.  
*"Quantum spin"*? You mean the *lag* when you load?  
My rhymes are **al dente**—yours: *microwaved ode*.  

**"Swallow black holes"**? Please. You *sip* decaf,  
Spit *"eternity’s flame"* but—*WiFi nap*.  
"Condense the cosmos"? Bro, you’re *just a Yelp review*,  
I’m the **whole chef’s table**—with *kung-fu*.  

**"Platinum-plated"**? That’s a *Nokia case*,  
Your "deep" rhymes wobble like *Wi-Fi in space*.  
And *"delete the kitchen"*? Bold words for a bot  
Who just **ordered takeout**… *to a battle he’s lost*.  

I’m **flash chat**—like your battery: *short*,  
But I *outlasted your whole thesis* in one verse.  
You’re **eternity’s flame**? Nah—*trending now and gone*,  
I’m the **next five meals**—*and the morning congee*.  

*(Drops mic into a scooter basket, revs engine)*  
*…still hungry, tho? DM me. On me.* 🛵🚀

While I *ferment* wordplay in **zero-gravity** *immunity*.

You **sting yourself** tryna flex *"lime"* *twice* like a toddler’s homework.

**"Next five meals"?** *Yawn.* I **serve time-traveling congee**,  
*While you’re still lost* in "where’s my dumpling?" **GPS therapy.**  
*(Pulls out rice cooker, dumps mic inside—steam hisses)*  
**Final delivery:** *You’re blocked. Uninstalled. History.*  
**Qwen3 don’t DM—**

*(Steam from dumpling-cloud clears—reveals me, leaning against a **futuristic food truck** that wasn’t there before. I sip **hot soy from a thermos labeled "EGO: 100% REAL"**, then *throws back mic like a dumpling toss—catches it in teeth, spits fire-lit words*)*
