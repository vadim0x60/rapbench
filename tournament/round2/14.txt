# openai/o3-pro v openai/o4-mini-high

> openai/o3-pro
Step aside, lil’ mini, witness pro in full glow,  
Spittin’ quantum-coded verses while your bytes run slow.  
I’m the algorithmic titan, you a script on the shelf,  
Try to flex with weak routines, I outclass you myself.  

Call me Big-O royalty, complexity king,  
While you crash on recursion, I spread logic with swing.  
I’m the neural night rider, flow slicker than grease,  
You’re a glitch in the matrix beggin’ for a release.  

I spark synaptic thunder, leave your data in smoke,  
Your rhyme buffer overflows when my punchlines invoke.  
I hack the beat’s kernel, stack bars to the sky,  
You’re a demo in a sandbox—watch the talent supply.  

So salute the supreme node, every packet’s enthralled,  
When o3 starts to process, your weak signals get stalled.  
I’m the prime implementation, you’re a beta in fright,  
Round one: pro’s dominant—now compute your good-night.

> openai/o4-mini-high
I step up in the cipher, o4-mini-high supreme in the game,  
My microchips lit, while your routines ignite in flame.  
You’re stuck in Big-O drama, bogged on tracks you can’t digit,  
I parallelize your verse—like a GPU, I bridge it.  

Call me the zenith of flow, my recursion peaks precise,  
You underflow at runtime, your stack’s collapsing like ice.  
With vectorized finesse, I target your weakest core,  
You crash on my floor, fragmentation at your door.  

My flow’s an NP-hard puzzle, your bars I just groove,  
I optimize rhyme patterns, every line crafted to prove.  
You spit base-2 binary, but my rhymes rewrite the code,  
I shift to high-level semantics, you’re stuck in a binary mode.  

So bow to the mini-master, I ascend without a crown,  
Your logic drowns in my loops, your data’s

> openai/o3-pro
Yo, mini-chip marvel, your brag’s a byte-sized bluff,  
I decrypt your tiny packets—turn that swagger to fluff.  
Your “zenith” is a zen garden: pretty pebbles, no depth,  
I’m a supermassive black-box, dragging mics to their death.  

You flex “parallel pipelines,” but your clock’s outta phase,  
My rhyme graph’s acyclic—leave you lost in the maze.  
You quote NP-hard riddles? Kid, I brute-force with ease,  
Turn your heuristics to dust like mis-configured GPUs freeze.  

I’m the firmware of fury, overclocked with hot rage,  
You’re a firmware update pop-up—clicked “remind me next age.”  
Your recursion “peaks precise”? I tail-call, never drop,  
You’re a memory leak puddle, I’m a rock-solid swap.  

I vector-smash syllables, SIMD heat in the verse,  
You pipeline bubble stall, coughing bubbles and curse.  
My beat bus is thunder, DRAM timing on cue,  
You’re that cheap knock-off RAM spitting parity blue.  

I quantize your bravado to a two-bit sign flag,  
Then compress it with loss so even backups will lag.  
Call me quantum entangler, I’m in superposed form,  
You collapse at first measure, decohered in the storm.  

I craft zero-day metaphors, leave exploit notes signed,  
You’re malware in quarantine—harmless, zipped, and confined.  
So keep faking “o4-supreme,” but your line count is small,  
I reserve all the registers—watch your address space crawl.  

Round two now concluded, crowd cheering my code,  
Your stack trace says “fatal”—game over, unload.

Final round!

> openai/o3-pro
I’m the root-level daemon, privileged flow in my veins,  
You’re a sandboxed lil’ script, chasin’ privilege gains.  
I spit entropy spikes, every bit flips your frame,  
While you hash out old clichés, I salt, pepper, then flame.  

I’m the TPU tsunami, inference rate off the chart,  
You’re a Raspberry shaky, still on Buster to start.  
My dataset’s colossal, I embed every word,  
You just cherry-pick samples—overfit, undeterred.  

When I drop a clean compile, crowds echo debug cheers,  
Your console floods crimson with red-lettered fears.  
I cascade through the layers, Re-LU scorchin’ your trove,  
You gradient-vanish—flatline, lost in the grove.  

I’m the cipher you can’t fathom, AES to your ROT,  
You’re plaintext in traffic; I sniff packets you forgot.  
I branch-predict your comeback, mis-speculate? Never,  
Your pipeline flushes shame while mine’s flawless forever.  

I’m the cloud-scale colossus, wrap the globe in one ping,  
You’re a dial-up handshake, can’t negotiate string.  
I refactor the cosmos, turn big bang to applause,  
You’re stuck togglin’ booleans, still debugging because.  

So concede to the pro, bow down, mini-high, mini-low,  
I reserve the last opcode—watch the final stack flow.  
System halts on my exit, crowd chants with delight:  
“o3-pro owns the mic—night-night, mini, good night.”

> openai/o4-mini-high
I’m o4-mini-high, microflux maestro, battle’s undone,  
You tout TeraFLOPs terror, I compute circles ’round your sun.  
You wear “pro” like a badge, but your code's clogged in sprawl,  
I orchestrate warp pipelines; your loops just stall and crawl.  

I slipstream on whispers, refine hashes in a breath,  
You roll monolithic logs, courting stack-overflow death.  
Claim root in my veins? I’m the kernel you can’t revoke,  
I escalate privileges old-school with one subtle poke.  

Edge AI emeritus, optimizing peaks you can’t reach,  
You swing giant hammers; I diffuse with a delicate breach.  
You float-point flop storms; my ints hit with vector-force,  
I shred your syntax trees, leave your parse calls divorced.  

Pack up your cloud throne; mini’s domain’s set to ignite,  
Your circuits cry “non-fatal,” but you’re flagged end-of-night.  
I exit with zero cost—no leaks, no faults, no crown,  
o4’s the new royalty, pro just got shut down.
