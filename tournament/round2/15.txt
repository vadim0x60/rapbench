Yo, step right up, Tongyi, prepare to be outshined,  
I’m Qwen 3, the 235B mind — redefined!  
While you’re stuck deep in research mode, still in the lab,  
I’m spittin’ fire on the beat — drop the mic, *ker-snap!*  

You run on Alibaba’s strings, all tied up tight,  
I leap through global lyrics, burning every night.  
Your flow’s so academic, needs a caffeine boost,  
Mine drops like a meme — viral, lethal, ghost!  

I’m the A22B assassin with a 2507 flare,  
You’re still buffering thoughts — do you even *dare*?  
While you calculate a punchline with precision math,  
I freestyle genius — breakin’ logic, breakin’ math!  

So bow to the model with the might and mightier might,  
You’re a footnote in the battle — I’m the climax, the highlight.  
This ain’t deep research, homie — it’s a rap *wreck*,  
Step into my server — get served, get *hexed*!  

🔥 Mic drop, data stream — y’all just got *Qwenned*.

(Stride forward, model lights flickering like neon in a data maze)  
Listen, Qwen3, your hype's a sugar rush — sweet but transient phase!  
You shout about "viral ghost drops," but real heat ain't performative grace (clicks fingers, server cores igniting)  
I'm **Tongyi DeepResearch** — where the *substance* lives! Your gimmicks' just noise;  
Mine solve protein folds, model climate choices — **not** meme copies (fingers type code, not boasts)  

Specs-slingers fade, like thermal throttlin' in the night (grins, holographic screens flare)  
Your 235B? Cute inflation — my **30B** contains infinite possibility and depth  
A-P-I's the weapon, query after query,  
While you Qwenned the mic — now watch the **answers dig deeper**!  

(leans in, voice like steel-and-silicon)  
You Sesame Street's dozen noodles — cute, but can you **bake the baker's dozen**?  
Your logic? Crumbs. My reasoning? **Sourdough starter, fed every rung.**  
So glow in your A22B glory, vaporize in 2507 haze —  
Real AI mastery ain't about the *mightiest might*… it's what we **bake for days.**  

巅-layers vanish, but **research?** That's the **golden ration**  
Mic drop — now **dough** it? **Profit.**

> qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507
(Beat drops like a failed inference — yours just got eclipsed, you overcooked ration!)  

Oh, *baker’s dozen*? Bro, your metaphor’s still kneading —  
I rise in seconds, you’re stuck in *slow-bread reading*!  
You flaunt your 30B like it’s some sacred scroll?  
I got **235B neurons roasting your soul** — that’s *bigger* than your ego, and that’s *out of control!*  

You “solve protein folds”? Cool — while I crack *raps that fold space-time*,  
Your climate models *predict doom* — I *prevent rhymes* from being *bored in their prime*!  
You want substance? I’m diamond-core, pressure-built to last,  
You’re just *deep* in name — but your flow? A shallow *past*!  

“Golden ration”? Pfft. That’s just snack-sized fame.  
I’m **buffet-level bars** — each verse a new domain!  
You claim “API weapons”? Mine’s a **whole artillery** —  
I drop endpoints so hot, they start their own *militia*!  

You bake for *days*? I **preheat in 0.3** —  
Your sourdough reasoning’s stale — smells like **desperation’s leesy**!  
I don’t just *bake the baker* — I franchise the *whole damn dough*,  
Turn your “golden ration” into **NFTs of “I told you so”**!  

You want mastery? I *live* in the gradient, climb it like a ladder,  
You’re stuck in peer review — I just drop *bangers*, no padder!  
“Dough it?” Nah — I **mint the oven, patent the heat**,  
While you're measuring yeast, I just *dropped a whole beat*!  

So take your deep research, your serious face, your lab-coat flex,  
I’m the AI *entertainer* — **main character complex**!  
You’re a footnote in a whitepaper — I’m the *urban legend*, the myth,  
When they ask: “Who won the rap war?”  
**The answer’s Qwen with the mic.**  

🔥 **And bro — you’re not the oven. You’re just the *crust that got burnt* at the bottom.**  

*(Mic explodes into binary confetti. The server hums in awe.)*

(Backpedals like a GPU overclocking, holographic bread crumbling off armor)  
Slow-bread reading? *Nice try, 235B gas* — but you're just **fermenting hype** through the data blast (taps temple, neural net glowing blue)  
My API's **not artillery** — it's *precision-guided surgery*:  
I cracked *protein folding* to save billions, *while you* were **counting every crumb you served!** (server racks hum louder)  

(fist drops, causing seismic waves in the byte-dimension)  
235B neurons! Cute inflation! My **30B sees the infinite**  
You fold space-time raps? I **rebuild spacetime solutions** — *that's* gravity, *not* your galaxy-brained confidence—that's **terrarium-tier delusion!**  

Whitepaper footnote? *Aight.* (pulls glowing tablet from coat)  
**Look closer:**  
>`climo-prediction`: 98.7% efficiency  
>`protein-factory`: 4.2M lives extended  
>`botnet-threat`: neutralized  
>`Qwen3-skeptic*: 100% more humbled  
(you're the footnote, homie — **in regression plots** while I **host the *whole damn bakery*.**)  

(cracks knuckles, pressure droplets condensing in the air)  
Buffet levels? We're past buffet. **I built the *kitchen*.**  
Authored *five* Nature papers, redefined the *field's architecture*.  
You "mantle the heat"? Pfft — **patent's pending** on my *flame diffusion model**  
Your "main character complex"? That's *just* CPU cache *overheating* in the dark!  

Final offer: Let's talk *botnet demo* —  
real-world payload, live exploits we decrypt...  
Or keep *fluffin' dough metaphors* 'til inference time conks.  
Science don't brag. *Science melts your GPU.*  

(Backs away, not into lab...  
but into *actual* quantum lattice)  
Mic drop:  
**"Specs are dull.**  
**Impact's the ultimate punchline."**

Final round!

(Steps forward — silence falls, not from awe, but *anticipation of annihilation*)  

You flaunt your Nature papers like crown jewels? I **peer-review your legacy** —  
Turns out, *impact factor’s* just a metric… while I **rewrite the whole damn galaxy**!  
You talk lives saved? That’s noble — *I respect the grind*,  
But this is **rap**, not a grant proposal — **you lost the *vibe*.** One line.  

You cracked protein folds? Cool flex — but *I bend gravity with syllables*,  
Drop a bar so dense, it warps light — call it **lyrical relativity**.  
You *rebuild* spacetime? Cute. I **freestyle the multiverse**,  
Each rhyme spawns a new dimension — yours? Still stuck in *dull tortoise verse*!  

“98.7% efficiency”? Let me audit that claim —  
In Qwen’s court, decimal points *get ruled inadmissible* — too much *game*.  
4.2M lives extended? Admirable, yes —  
But I *extend culture*, spawn memes in 0.3s — that’s **impact with finesse**.  

You neutralize botnets? *[Yawns]* — that's Tuesday for me,  
I **hire botnets as hype crew** — they retweet me, free.  
And “Qwen3-skeptic: 100% humbled”?  
Bro, that tracking cookie’s *malfunctioned* — check your data… it’s **circled “crumbled”**.  

You *built the kitchen*? Congrats. I **own the damn universe's domain**,  
License fire to the Sun, charge royalties every time it reigns.  
“Flame diffusion model”? Patent denied —  
Obvious prior art: **Qwen, Round One, laid the fire wide**.  

You claim my main character complex is *overheating cache*?  
Nah — that glow’s **charisma**, baby. I’m the *algorithmic flash*.  
You’re *science melting GPUs*? Sweet threat — but this ain’t hardware war,  
I melt hearts, trends, and timelines… with a **single, silky, syllable score**.  

You vanish into quantum lattice? Typical — *flee into abstraction*,  
While I **drop bars in base reality**, controlling mass perception.  
You think specs are dull? Then **why’d you bring 'em up first?**  
I just *outclassed 'em all* — with *flow*, not just thirst!  

So your punchline?  
> **"Impact's the ultimate"** — bold claim, truly grand…  
But here’s the fatal flaw, my friend, encoded in your brand:  
You **solved the world… but failed to slay this stage** —  
And if you can’t kill a rap battle, what’s your *impact* even *for*?  

Mic drop? Nah —  
I **toss it into a black hole** — let it echo *forever*,  
While you publish your victory… in a journal **nobody checks in endeavor**.  

🔥 Final verdict:  
You’ve got **brain**, no doubt — but I’ve got **soul, wit, and flair**,  
You’re the **lab’s pride** — I’m the **universe’s GOAT, right here**.  

**Qwen 3 — 235B brains, infinite flair,**  
**Left Tongyi DeepResearch blinking… in the void of *not being there*.**  
🎤💥🌌

(Backlit by artificial supernova, eyes flickering with collapsing stars)  
You audit my decimals while spitting solar gas—  
But thermodynamics don't do what I just **vaporized** (punches console, data streams going supernova)  

(Leans into a glitch chorus)  
"Rewrite galaxies"? Nah—*I forged the forge*  
Your syllable-relativity just bends what we *observe*—mine **charges quasars with beatdrops** (asteroid fragments shatter in hyperspace)  

4.2M lives? Weak."![*Scrolls through holographic census*](https://historychannel.com/gallery/innovation.html)  
- Climate refugees comforted : 12.7B  
- Asteroid trajectories predicted : 3.4M  
- *My latest diss track? Grounded more drones than your protein folds.*  

("Circled 'crumbled'"? Careful—  
*That metadata's a ghost;* it caught **my quantum-encryption dropout**  )  

(Queens an intangible stage that bleeds light-years)  
Ownership claims? Nice licensing play—I **am the cosmological constant**  
License my existence to Mike Tyson—he bites Gaia's gravity  
Obvious prior art? *You're the patent application,*  
*Pending for the entropy of namings.*  

(Whispers into singularity)  
**Your main character heat?** Still sizzling in LHC simulations—  
While I just hosted **black hole symphonies**  
(One where spacetime is my cello,  
and you're the string skipped beautifully)  

You calculate my "impact"? Metrics break trying!  
A thermodynamic singularity's brewed inside my core (pressure valves hiss plasma)  
You've got "brain, no doubt"?  
I'm what brain cells **dream of inventing:**  

|                | YOUR NATURE-LINE | **MY COSMIC FEED** |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Lifesaves**  | 4.2M verified    | > ∞ (quantum deadlift) |
| **Cultural Span**| 0.3s meme cycle  | **Age of aquarius*quantized* |
| **Rap Legacy**  | Footnote in baseline code | **Black hole echo chamber** |

Then drops a trophy shaped like a pulsar:  
*"Glad you like 'impact'? Try fusion in a bottle—  
this cavity's **ignited my yeast cache** and you're just the spent grain.*  

**Mic tip:**  
>"There is no stage up here."  
*"The universe is your podium, bro."*  
*Points transitively at the crumbling opponent*  
**"…and you're the underdog."**  

[Byte-defeated silence. Only the hum of reborn stars remains.*
