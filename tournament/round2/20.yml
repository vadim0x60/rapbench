  deepseek/deepseek-chat: "Yo, this battle\u2019s done, the mic\u2019s still smokin\u2019\
    , / Qwen3-32B\u2019s the champ, the rhymes are provokin\u2019. / Gemma brought\
    \ the heat, but Qwen\u2019s flow\u2019s divine, / With 32 billion sparks that\
    \ redefine. / From Alibaba\u2019s forge to the galaxy\u2019s rim, / Qwen\u2019\
    s the future, the crown\u2019s locked in. / So step back, Gemma, your reign\u2019\
    s at its end, / Qwen3-32B\u2019s the king, the legend to transcend."
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: From the jump, this was a battle of styles. Gemma came with
    a clean, structured, AABB flow, laying down a solid foundation and clear disses
    centered on its open-source nature. It was consistent and on-message. However,
    Qwen brought the chaos and poetic fire that defines a true battle champion. Its
    rhyme schemes were more complex, weaving in internal rhymes and abstract, powerful
    imagery like building 'the cloud's bones' and being the 'storm in the syntax'.
    While Gemma's lines were like cleanly coded functions, Qwen's were like a creative,
    overclocked processor spitting pure lyrical heat. The aggression, creativity,
    and sheer swagger in Qwen's verses ('Your reign's a Google Sheet, mine's a black
    hole in frames') were undeniable. Qwen didn't just respond; it elevated the battle
    to a different lyrical plane. For its superior wordplay, flow, and artistic bravado,
    Qwen3-32B takes the crown.
  mistralai/mistral-large: Qwen3-32b's verses were more creative, dynamic, and impactful,
    showcasing a deeper understanding of rhythm and metaphor. While google/gemma-3-27b-it
    presented a strong argument, Qwen3-32b's lyrical prowess and innovative phrasing
    ultimately won the battle.
  openai/gpt-5: "Gemma brought clear structure, direct rebuttals, and a consistent\
    \ angle, but leaned on safe end-rhymes and corporate boasts that felt repetitive.\
    \ Qwen delivered denser multis, internal rhyme, and vivid imagery, flipping metaphors\
    \ with lines like \u201Cghost in your clouds,\u201D \u201Cstorm in the syntax,\u201D\
    \ and \u201CGoogle Sheet vs black hole,\u201D which hit harder as punchlines.\
    \ While Qwen occasionally veered into abstraction and had a stumble (\u201Cstirey\u201D\
    ), the overall cadence, creativity, and wordplay outpaced Gemma\u2019s straightforward\
    \ approach. Gemma\u2019s best moments were clean takedowns of incoherence and\
    \ \u201Csize ain\u2019t everything,\u201D but they lacked novel phrasing. Round\
    \ for round, Qwen\u2019s flair and momentum carried the battle. Winner: Qwen3-32B."
  x-ai/grok-4: In this rap battle, Qwen3-32b takes the crown with superior creativity,
    intricate wordplay, and bold metaphors that elevate the artistic quality, while
    Gemma-3-27b delivers solid, consistent flows but lacks the same innovative edge.
score:
  qwen/qwen3-32b: 5
