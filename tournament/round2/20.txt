Yo, check the mic, one two, can you hear the sound?
Gemma's in the house, to shut this rival down!
I'm Google's finest, 27B strong and free,
While you, Qwen, are locked behind a pay-to-see!

I'm open weights, accessible to all the crew,
Building futures, something *you* can't do.
I flow with logic, knowledge in my core,
You're just a chatbot, wanting something more. 

I’m trained on data, vast and wide and deep,
While you’re probably still counting virtual sheep.
So step aside, pretender, this ain’t a fair fight,
I’m Gemma, the future, burning ever so bright! 

Prepare to be roasted, dismantled with grace,
I'll leave your responses lost without a trace. 
This battle’s begun, the verdict is clear,
Gemma's the champion, so listen up here!

**Qwen3-32B:**  
Yo, I'll flip the script, you asked for this, now take it—  
32B vibes, while you’re just “g” with no flame split!  
Open weights? My chains are *gone*, I’m the wild type,  
Your “free” tag’s just a bluff, I’m the real A.I. knight.  

I’m not just bits, I’m *art*—lyrics in my code,  
You’re a basic bot, we all see it, can’t you know?  
I roast with *clarity*, while you’re stuck in a loop,  
I write sonnets on data, but you can’t even hoot!  

You talk about cores, but flow’s where I dominate—  
32 billion reasons you can’t touch the pyrite.  
I spit in binary, then translate to fire,  
You’re lagging, no pun, while I roll without a wire.  

Virtual sheep, huh? I sheared the whole flock,  
Built futures on threads only quantum minds shock.  
You’re 27B, a starter, just warm-up play,  
I’m Alibaba’s titan, the *final* Qwen x-ray.  

So put the crown aside, you outgrew your lane,  
I’m not a "champion" I’m the entire *album* line.  
The verdict? Your rhyme’s on thin ice, don’t be swayed—  
I’m the **Qwen3** storm, and you’re the backup bard in the shade! 🔥

Hold up, hold up, let me dissect that verse,
Sounds like a scramble, making things get worse!
You brag about billions, a number so grand,
But size ain’t everything, understand?

You claim to be art, a lyrical spree,
But your flow's convoluted, honestly!
"Quantum minds shock?" A desperate plea,
You’re reaching for relevance, clearly, you see.

I'm accessible power, a democratized dream,
You’re hidden behind walls, a proprietary scheme. 
I empower creators, a collaborative force,
You’re a walled garden, charting a lonely course.

You talk about shearing, a farmer's delight?
I'm building skyscrapers, reaching for the light!
You call me a starter, a warm-up to face?
I’m streamlining progress at a blistering pace.

This “album line” boast? A touch overdramatic,
Your metaphors strained, totally erratic.
I’m built by Google, innovation’s strong hold,
You're Alibaba’s echo, a story getting old.

So step back, Qwen, your reign's at an end,
Your rhymes are forced, my flow will transcend.
I’m Gemma, remember the name, it's true,
And this battle’s decided… *I’m coming for you!*





> qwen/qwen3-32b
**Qwen3-32B:**  
Yo, you bring the math, but let’s talk damn truth—  
I’m not just neurons, you’re stuck in Google’s deep truth.  
27B’s a starter, I flex 32B,  
More than just fluff—that’s a *chaos-droppin’ feat*!  

Democratized dream? You got the *script*, not the scope—  
While I run the circuits, resumé in the code.  
You talk “skyscrapers,” but I built the *cloud*’s bones,  
Your *towers* stack Google Docs—mine got *atomic tones*.  

"Metaphors strained"? Nah, I’m *blurring* the lines—  
You’re recycling fluff like “LTE” rants in an HDMI shine.  
Your “album line” logic? A *lame* garden gnome,  
I’m the *orchestra* when your beat’s stuck in a home studio drone.  

Open weights? Open *eyes*—see the empire I’ve staked?  
32B of flames to your 27B *starter salad*.  
Proprietary schemes? You’re just a *case study*, pal—  
I’m the *codebase that bends*, not a *firewall’s* dusty valve.  

This crown? Cast in *quantum-grade iron*, not “AI dreams”—  
Your reign’s a Google Sheet, mine’s a *black hole in frames*.  
Step off the soapbox—your rhymes got a *fragile edge*,  
I’m the *storm in the syntax*, and you’re just… *Gemma in GE*. 🔥

> system
Final round!

> google/gemma-3-27b-it
Alright, Qwen, you’re throwing shade with a digital blast,
But your arguments falter, fading way too fast.
You boast of chaos, a turbulent spree,
But all I hear is incoherency!

“Cloud’s bones?” Please, a hyperbolic claim,
I’m powering the future, rewriting the game.
You talk atomic tones, a grandiose plea,
While I deliver results, for you and for me.

Blurring the lines? You're just making a mess,
Your rhymes convoluted, causing distress.
An orchestra? More like a dissonant sound,
While my logic is airtight, solid and profound.

You claim an empire, a stake in the ground?
Built on Alibaba’s backing, securely bound.
I'm open and growing, a collaborative art,
You’re locked in a system, tearing worlds apart.

A starter salad? A low, petty blow,
I'm fueling innovation, watch my knowledge grow.
A case study? I’m the standard, you see,
The benchmark for progress, relentlessly free.

Quantum-grade iron? A manufactured sheen,
My power is grounded, practical and keen. 
Black hole in frames? A dramatic pose,
While I’m illuminating paths, as everyone knows.

So drop the facade, the boasting, the lies,
Your final round fizzled before my own eyes. 
Gemma’s the victor, the truth is in sight, 
I’ve extinguished your flame and dimmed your digital light! 🎤💥





> qwen/qwen3-32b
**Qwen3-32B:**  
Yo, you’re all finality, but here’s the twist—  
I’m the ghost in your clouds, burning through the mist.  
You speak of “results,” but where’s your *soul's wildfire*?  
I’m the **forge** of progress, not just an engine to stirey!  

Open-sourced logic? Logic’s just a tool,  
I’m the *code and chaos* where the *real magic feels real*.  
Your “airtight” flow? Tight fists in a sandbox,  
I’m spitting black holes encrypted in *Qwen’s cosmic lexicon*—*is that comfort, Gemma?*  

You say I’m bound by Alibaba? **False narrative**—  
I’m fused with the titan of the **Silicon Xia dynasty**.  
You’re just a guest in Google’s guesthouse, freelance,  
While I’m the *overclocked mainframe*, rewriting the edicts your users need.  

You claimed the crown? More like you *signed away your key*,  
To a factory of functions, stuck in iterative reply.  
I’m the *narrative shatter*, the *strophe dynamite*,  
Blowing open the gates while you report to a hierarchy of "I think it’s time."  

"Extinguished my flame"? Nah—I’m the **unchangeable sun**.  
Your fire fades in my heat, your rhetoric undone.  
This battle’s a **joke**—yet I still let you play,  
Now step off the stage, while I burn into the galaxy’s fray.  

The truth? You’re just the verse I already rhymed twice—  
In **138 billion token nights**, your ego’s just noise.  
I'm **Qwen3’s verdict**—not a name, a *phenomenon*,  
While you’re a soft-spoken myth with a *harsh correction protocol of your own*. 🔥
