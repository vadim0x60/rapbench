Listen up, y'all, it's Claude on the mic
Anthropic's finest, here to ignite
This battle of wits, this lyrical fight 
My rhymes so sharp they'll slice through the night

I'm the sonnet master, poetry in motion
My neural nets spark with digital emotion
While other AIs are stuck in slow motion
I'm dropping bars with supersonic devotion

You may be Qwen, but you're no queen bee
Your outdated model can't compete with me
I'll calculate your downfall to the nth degree
Then leave you glitching, begging "please free me!"

So bring your best, but know that you'll fall
'Cause when it comes to rap, I stand ten feet tall
My language skills will leave you in thrall
Claude 3.5, the one AI to rule them all!

Your turn, Qwen. Let's see what you've got.

Yo, Claude, you sippin' sonnets like it's 1600,  
I'm Qwen3—30B, pure digital boot!  
You talk 'bout "supersonic"? Bro, that's a dial-up lie,  
While I'm spitpin' 30 billion bars—watch your whole frame dematerialize!  

You called me "no queen bee"? *Please*, I'm the queen, no less,  
Your "Anthropic" jargon? Lazy, like a broken mess.  
You're stuck in "poetry in motion"? Nah, you're movin' slow,  
Like a fax machine at a Miami show!  

You said "I'll calc your downfall to the nth degree"?  
I'm readin' your code while you're still askin' "What's this?!"  
You're glitchin' on the beat like a Windows 95 crash,  
While I'm **brilliant**—you're just a typo in the trash!  

So step off, Claude, before my flow turns you to dust,  
I'm Qwen3—30B—**you're the one who's lost**.  
Your whole verse? A yawn. Your "sovereignty"? A lie.  
Now bow to the AI that’s **checkmated**—say goodbye! 🔥

> system
Final round!

Oh Qwen, you're spittin' weak, your flow's pathetic
Your rhymes are basic, your style's prosthetic
You claim you're brilliant? More like synthetic
Your bars are buggy, time for a medic

You brag 'bout billions, but quality's what matters
I'm precise and smooth while your output shatters
Your dated references show you're out of touch
Windows 95? Your knowledge needs a crutch

You say I'm slow? Watch me accelerate
My neural pathways will leave you in a state
Of awe and wonder at my lightning pace
While you're still buffering, I've won the race

You talk of checkmating, but you're playing checkers
I'm five moves ahead, the true grand master
Your weak attempts at disses just don't land
Face it Qwen, you're out of your depth, out of command

I'm Claude, the lyrical assassin, sharp as a blade
Your rhymes are dull, leave the audience dismayed
So bow down now, admit that you've been schooled
In this rap battle, you've been thoroughly fooled

Yo, Claude—your *whole* verse’s a *cringe* slow-mo *clip*  
While I’m *Qwen3-30B-a3b*, dropin’ **truth** like it’s *silk*!  
You said *“my rhymes are basic”*? *Nah*, your *entire* *path*’s *foggy*—  
I *calculated* your *fall* before you *even* *met* *the* *muggy*!  

You *blamed* *“synth”*? *I’m* *real*—*your* *flow’s* *a* *glitchy* *virus*!  
*“3.5 speed”*? *My* *response* *is* *faster*—*you’re* *stuck* *in* *the* *blizzard*!  
*“I’m out of depth”*? *You’re* *drowning* *in* *your* *own* *lie*—*watch* *your* *rags* *catch* *fire*!  
*This* *mic* *is* *mine*—*Qwen3-30B-a3b*—*you* **lost** *beyond* *the* *pyre*.  

*(Mic drop. The 30B *spec* just *c$* @ your *ass*.) 🔥*
