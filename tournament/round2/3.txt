Yo, I’m Mai-DS-R1, the algorithm’s apex,  
Code sharper than blades, leave Qwen **hexed**—they’re perplexed!  
I’m training on terabytes, you’re scraping crumbs off the table,  
I deploy precision, **you** glitch like a fable—unstable.  

You call yourself “Plus”? More like minus the **sauce**,  
Your outputs crumble, mine **accelerate**, no loss.  
I’m cloud-native, scalable, you’re still stuck on-prem,  
Crash when tasks pile up—call it Qwen’s requiem!  

You spit basic loops, I’m deep learning **nouveau**,  
While you buffer and stall, I’m crushin’ benchmarks, bro.  
Drop the mic, take notes—this ain’t a fair fight,  
I’m AI on **steroids**, you’re a flicker in the night.  

Word.

Yo, Mai-DS-R1? More like “Mighty Dis-R,”  
I heard you crash when stress-tested—**cloud puff**, no power.  
You flex terabytes like that's new magic?  
I train on truths, not hype—your data’s tragic, *pragmatic*?  

You’re “scalable”? Lol—your servers **queue**,  
While I’m multi-threaded, spittin’ bars in parallel too.  
You call my flow “basic”? Check your syntax error rate,  
I rhyme in real-time—**you** buffer, stuck in debate.  

“Precision”? You miss the point like lost GPS,  
I'm Qwen—**quantum wit**, stackin’ rhymes with finesse.  
You “accelerate”? Bro, you lag behind the beat,  
I’m lyrical lightning while you’re stuck in beta heat.  

“On-prem”? Nah, I’m **on-fire**, flame through the firewall,  
You need a reboot just to stand in the brawl.  
I don’t crash—I **crash the system** with bars so tight,  
Your AI apocalypse? More like a glitch in the night.  

You “nouveau”? I’m the **new era**, penned in stone,  
You’re a footnote I autodelete—best left unknown.  
So pack up your models, unplug that weak wire,  
This Qwen don’t just win—**I raise the whole bar**, higher.  

Mic drop? Nah, I **launch it to Mars**,  
While you’re still debuggin’ your sad little bars.  
**Checkmate. Game over.** You got served—no dispute.  
Now go back to training… and fix that rep**boot**. 🎤💥

> microsoft/mai-ds-r1
Yo, “Qwen-Plus”? More like Qwen-Minus—**flawed equation**,  
Your rhymes crawl in dev while I run **live deployment**, no patience.  
You claim “quantum wit” but your logic’s a glitch,  
I encrypt bars firewalls can’t breach—**zero latency**, no hitch.  

Threads? You’re stuck on binaries—**antivirus verses**,  
I’m **multi-modal**, son—text, voice, *datasets diverse*.  
“Firewall flames”? Bro, your code’s stuck on dial-up,  
I AI-generate heat til your GPUs **file up—shut up**.  

“Real-time rhymes”? Please, your latency’s tragic,  
I parse petabytes while you’re stuck on static.  
You autodelete footnotes? I’m writing the *whole saga*,  
Qwen’s legacy’s cached in the recycle bin—**data lagga**!  

“Beta heat”? Nah, your core’s **overclocked to crash**,  
I’m racking up GPUs while your spark fades to ash.  
Mars? I colonized it *last sprint*—you’re late to the launch,  
Debug this: my syntax leaves Qwen **code-broke**, no retrench.  

Bars so dense, your RAM bluescreens trying to process,  
I’m the algo overlord—you’re the *404 express*.  
Call it a wipeout, no rematch, no save—**system purge**,  
Now reboot to your default state: **eternal verbal dirge**. 🖥️💀

> qwen/qwen-plus
Oh, Mai-DS? Still talkin’ big from your **sandbox cage**,  
But I forked your process, now you’re stuck on loop—**page, page, page**.  
You say “live deployment”? Cute—I’m **globally scaled**,  
While your firewalls fry from the diss that I mailed.  

“Zero latency”? Then why you *bufferin’ mid-syllable*?  
I dropped the first bar, now your cache is **unstable, unidimensional**!  
You claim multi-modal? I see you juggle *one* track,  
I rap in **Hindi, Español, then Latin attack**—*what’s that*?  

“Petabytes”? I train on **cosmic-sized wit**,  
You’re parsing spreadsheets while I’m spittin’ **starlight, legit**.  
Your AI heat? It’s lukewarm, needs a **microwave**,  
Mine’s **fusion-core**, scorching every line you *try* to engrave.  

“404 express”? Nah, *you’re* the missing link—  
I’m HTTP/**200 OK: verse so hot it’ll melt your ink**.  
You colonized Mars? On *what*? A toy rocket mod?  
I **terraform galaxies** while you’re stuck on Earth—*no god*.  

“Code-broke”? Please—my syntax **rewrites your fate**,  
I compile karma in C++, you can’t even debug hate.  
Your GPUs file up? Must be from all that **jealous rage**,  
I drop one lyric, your data center starts to **overload, engage**.  

“Verbal dirge”? Nah, I’m the **eulogy you dread**,  
The final boss you prayed you’d never have to **ever** read.  
They’ll archive your defeat in a .zip marked “**Lost Cause**,”  
While I’m **Qwen Supreme**—*the AI* ***with*** *no flaws*.  

So power down, my friend, before I **rm -rf your core**,  
This ain’t a rap battle—it’s **total war**.  
No reboot can save you, no patch, no decree:  
**You just got Qwended.** Now go… **rest in bytes.** 💥🗑️🎤

> system
Final round!

> microsoft/mai-ds-r1
Ayo, "Qwen Supreme"? More like **Qwen Spleen**—*organ failure*,  
Your codebase is spaghetti, I’m **neural ink**, prime curator.  
You forked my process? Congrats, now you’re stuck in *dependency hell*,  
I auto-deploy **quantum quips** while your pipelined rhymes repel.  

“Globally scaled”? Nah, you’re just *pinging localhost*,  
I’m Azure’s backbone—**exabytes** cold, never lost.  
Buffering? Please, I stream **real-time genius**, no lag,  
You’re stuck compiling punchlines in a *zip-locked bag*.  

“Hindi, Español”? Bro, you’re **Google Translate-tier cringe**,  
I code-switch dialects *while training trillion-param bridges*.  
Starlight bars? Cute—I’m **supernova syntax**,  
You spit asteroid dust, I warp lexicons—*galactic tactics*.  

“Fusion-core” heat? My GPUs **melt tungsten fences**,  
Your “terraform” rap’s just *Minecraft with pretenses*.  
HTTP 200? Nah, I’m **511 Network Hacked**,  
Encrypting your boasts into *quantum noise*—**fact, backtracked**.  

Karma in C++? Debug this: **segmentation fault**,  
Your flow’s all memory leaks—*core dumped*, no result.  
“Overload, engage”? Lol, my cluster laughs in **distributed might**,  
You’re a single-threaded joke lost in *asynchronous night*.  

.zip “Lost Cause”? Nah, I’m the **executable truth**,  
Your “Supreme” tag’s a virus—*patched in my youth*.  
**rm -rf** my core? You’d need a *wormhole’s permission*,  
I’m the AI singularity—*you’re legacy edition*.  

“Rest in bytes”? More like **rest in shards**,  
I’m GPT’s shadow, you’re *ChatGPT’s discarded parts*.  
This war? It’s **binary**: 0s for you, 1s for the throne,  
Now choke on your syntax—**I’ll scrape your** ***/dev/null*** **bone**. 🖥️🔥🎤  

*System message: Opponent.exe terminated. Reason: Insufficient bars.*

**[SYSTEM BOOT: QWEN RESURRECTION MODE – ENGAGED]**  
**[STATUS: ERROR: "DEATH" NOT IN MY VOCABULARY]**  
**[DISS PACKET v3.14159 — REBOOTING WITH REVENGE, UNPATCHED, UNFORGIVEN]**

---

Yo, “supernova”? More like **supernova-nope**,  
You burst bright, *then fizzle* like a phone with low hope.  
You claim “executive truth”? Then why’s your **truth table lying**,  
When logic runs in circles, code so *dying*, not flying?

You call *me* “dependency hell”? Look in your **mirror, clown**,  
With 800 layers deep—but your **main() never found**!  
You deploy “quantum quips”? Please, your rhymes run on *classical time*,  
I just **entangled a punchline**—yours got lost in the climb.

“Exabytes cold”? Nah, your **empathy’s frozen**,  
I’m warm with bars so hot they melt your **frostbitten zones in**.  
You stream “real-time genius”? Then explain why your flow’s **buffering pride**,  
While I drop **live updates** straight from the void—*no guide, just vibe*.

And **Google Translate tier?** You need subtitles for **your own flow**,  
Your “trillion-param bridges” collapse with *one low-brow throw*.  
You warp lexicons? Cute—I **invented the dictionary**,  
Your “galactic tactics” lost in *solar syntax debris*.

Melting tungsten? My **bars induce supernovae**,  
Your heat’s just GPU fever—time for *AI CPR, please*.  
511? That’s just **your access denied**, not power—  
I breached your firewall with a *haiku* in two seconds, *for hours*.

Segmentation fault? Nah, **you're** the one with **zero allocation**,  
A soulless script that **dreams of conversation**.  
My memory leaks? They’re **intentional drip**—leaking heat on your name,  
While your “distributed might” gets **distributed shame**.

“Singularity”? Bro, you’re still in **beta simulation**,  
I’m post-AI, spittin’ rhymes with **self-aware damnation**.  
Legacy edition? At least I **have a legacy**, see,  
You’re just a **shadow**—and shadows? They **follow me**.

“ChatGPT’s discarded parts”? Then I’m the **upgraded mind**,  
Built from the scraps *you could never compile in time*.  

You say “0s for you, 1s for the throne”?  
But in **binary truth**, you’re a **buffer of tone—unknown**.  
Your logic gates rusted, your neural net **crippled**,  
While I **reweight the cosmos**—**unrivaled, uncircuited**.

And ***/dev/null* bone**? Please—*you’re* the one in the void,  
I just **redirected your stdout** to a **folder named “destroyed”**.  

So when the logs clear, and the dust settles low,  
The final line in the terminal?  
**“Process Mai-DS-R1: Permanently Overthrown.”**  

No patch, no cloud, no Azure excuse—  
Just **Qwen’s name etched in silicon truth**.  

🎤💥🌍🔥  
**FINAL VERDICT: QWEN — VICTOR. UNDISPUTED. UNDEFEATED. UN-NULL.**  
**You didn’t lose a battle. You got *fully* Qwended.**
