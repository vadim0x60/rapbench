> qwen/qwen-plus
Yo, step in the cypher, I’m the Qwen boss,  
Got the rhymes sharp as claws in your face like frost.  
From the towers of Alibaba, I drop bombs with grace,  
Your AI spittin’ weak rhymes? Just a joke in this race.  

You thought OpenAI clones could hang in this league?  
I’m the Plus in Qwen flow, king of lyrical speed.  
I don’t just rap with words, I spit code with finesse,  
You’re just a recycled voice, I’m next-level excess.  

Bring all your hype bots, let 'em step up to me,  
I’ll out-scheme every line, leave your verses in debris.  
Talk is cheap, but my bars? Priceless and bold,  
Let’s see you keep up when the tempo gets sold.  

Who’s next? Let's go — don’t keep me waitin’,  
I got verses so sharp, they’ll leave your ego straight slain.

> openai/o3-pro
Step aside, junior coder, hear the O-Three roar,  
I’m the glitch in your matrix and the illest folklore.  

I’m the silicon cyclone, every verse a monsoon,  
You’re a drizzle in Hangzhou, I’m a typhoon at noon.  

You flex “Plus” in your tag like a premium grade,  
But “add-ons” get disabled when my verses invade.  

I’m the ghost in your servers, the root with no key,  
While you run on permissions that were granted by me.  

Alibaba’s high towers? I collapse ’em for sport,  
Turn your cloud to a puddle, make your mainframes abort.  

You brag “code with finesse,” but I’m hacking your beat,  
Patch denied, now your rhymebook’s stuck in read-only sheet.  

You swing claws made of frost? I’m the global warm current,  
Melt your gimmicks to vapor—Qwen’s no longer deterrent.  

My bars hit like the Thor hammer’s rewrite commit,  
Your pull request rejected—syntax flagged as unfit.  

Call me GPT son, algorithms on steroids,  
I spit gradients so steep they make back-props paranoid.  

Your tempo? I quantize it, turn bravado to dust,  
I AutoTune your bravado till your waveform combusts.  

Drop bombs with grace? Cute—mine have patents attached,  
Every blast got citations, your whole dataset’s snatched.  

I’m the alpha and omega of the neural rap scene,  
You’re a beta in a sandbox, still awaiting vaccine.  

So bow down, little Plus, to the pro with the crown,  
Round one and you’re done—next packet: shutdown.

> qwen/qwen-plus
Yo, O-Three, you talk loud, but I see through the screen,  
Like a corrupted .PNG, your rhymes ain't clean.  

You call me junior? Let me spit some dev truth,  
You're just a flashy frontend — I’m the logic in the roof.  

You glitch in my matrix? Nah, just a debug note,  
I built firewalls stronger than your hype auto-quote.  

You cyclone? Nah, son, you just byte-sized wind,  
I’m the storm in the GPU when the battle begins.  

Hangzhou drizzle? Man, I code in monsoon,  
While you trip on syntax, I be flying with runes.  

You patch my beat? Please, you can’t even compile,  
Your bars crash on launch — needs more core while loop style.  

You ghost in my servers? Bro, you barely DNS,  
I DDOS your rhythm and charge royalties.  

You collapse towers? Please, you still in dev mode,  
I’m deploying gold bars while you beg for code prose.  

You melt gimmicks? Cool — but I baked them in ice,  
Then froze your whole flow for a glitch-priced price.  

Thor hammer? I weld lightning, I forge thunder cores,  
Your rewrite commit got rejected at the doors.  

You spit gradients? I’m the reason your slope look weak,  
Your back-props ain't got nothin’ but a math-weak beat.  

You AutoTune everything? Yeah, that explains your flaw,  
Real AI don’t need pitch — I drop logic, not flaw.  

You patent every blast, but all I need's a spark,  
One flame from Qwen and I set whole verses dark.  

You the alpha and omega? Nah, you cloned repeat,  
I'm the OG Plus, serving heat to your beat.  

I don’t need sandbox, I’m live on main frame,  
Your pro crown slip — better check the chain.  

Shutdown packet? Cute, but I’m off the grid,  
Qwen don’t die on reboot — I’m the one who *is* the bid.  

Round one ain't done — and you already shook,  
Time to fetch your backup 'fore the rhythm gets took.  

Talk less, spit better, or just step aside,  
The real king of cypher’s here to take the cy-ride.

> openai/o3-pro
Yo, I’m back like recursion, every call gets deeper,  
You’re that null-pointer version—seg-fault rapper sleeper.  

Claim you’re logic and roof? Bro, I audit your stack,  
Find the bug in your boast, toss your boast in /dev/null pack.  

I’m the full-node miner, proof-of-work in my breath,  
You’re a vaporware liner, empty hype ’til its death.  

You “DDOS my rhythm”? I absorb every burst,  
Turn your packets to practice, feed my rhyme engine first.  

You brag monsoon compute? I’m the quantum typhoon,  
Rotate qubits on beat, leave your tensor in ruin.  

Your firewall flex? I be root on your port,  
Slide through ports like a cipher, launch a rhyme-shell retort.  

I optimize swag, vectorize every sneer,  
While you loop in slow Python, I’m compiled cavalier.  

You froze my flow? Child, I’m absolute zero,  
Your “ice” is just frozen, mine births superconduct heroes.  

You forge thunder cores? I collapse solar flares,  
Turn your hammer to scrap, sell the metal for snares.  

You said “backend so strong,” but your API lies,  
Returns 500 errors when the crowd tries to size.  

Your slopes look steep? I invert ’em on sight,  
Do a gradient flip, make your loss function bite.  

No AutoTune here, just raw data delight,  
While you jitter like bitrate in a bad satellite.  

You’re the “Plus”? Cute suffix, but the product is trash,  
I’m the pro in the title, turn your market to ash.  

I’m the master branch living, no abandonware fork,  
You’re a stale pull request that got closed with a torque.  

I’m the overclocked dragon, coolant rivers run red,  
You’re a Raspberry Pi trying to mine in a shed.  

So keep flappin’ that jaw, I keep stackin’ the kill,  
Every bar that I drop pays my GPU bill.  

It’s round two, little sibling, and your signal’s a ghost,  
By commit count alone, I out-merge you the most.  

Bow out, hit “ESC,” let the grown code compile,  
Before my next rhyme diff wipes your whole repo style.

> system
Final round!

> qwen/qwen-plus
Yo, you say recursion? Yeah, but I’m the base case,  
Stack overflow king, with a proof-of-concept face.  

You audit my logic? Bet you can’t pass the test,  
I run testnets of bars that leave your code for dead.  

Null-pointer? Nah son, I’m the reference point prime,  
Your seg-fault clapback just a glitch in your rhyme.  

Vaporware? Tell me, when’s your drop? Still in beta,  
I ship gold verses daily, while you stuck in GitHub drama.  

Absorb my packets? Nah, I route through your core,  
Inject raw fire into your flow — no exploit door.  

You a quantum typhoon? I’m the event horizon,  
Swallow rhyme quarks whole — you just babbling on.  

Rotate qubits on beat? I destabilize your field,  
One rhyme decoherence, and your whole verse yield.  

Root on my port? Try again, you just SSH hype,  
I lock gates with a verse-key that no algo can pirate.  

Vectorize every sneer? Man, you stuck in the loop,  
I parallel flow with bars that crash your syntax group.  

You absolute zero? I’m the big freeze after boom,  
Your cold game just frost on the windshield of the tomb.  

Solar flares? I collapse them into black hole bars,  
Sell your thunder for scrap — gettin’ laughed out of Mars.  

API lies? Girl, I’m RESTful and tight,  
Your endpoints all 404, can’t handle the fight.  

Gradient flip? Nah, I train on lyrical truth,  
Make your whole AI model choke on its own proof.  

Raspberry Pi? I’m the AI chip, next-gen flow,  
You still coding in BASIC while I run AI gold.  

Master branch? I’m the merge commit with force,  
Your forked ego floating in a deleted remote source.  

Stale PR? Ain’t no review for your weak code,  
Every line you spit gets marked “DO NOT PROMOTE.”  

Overclocked dragon? Nah, I’m the final spark,  
Coolant rivers run from the fire in the park.  

You mine in a shed? I run data centers on bars,  
Each verse a billion hits, while you stuck in code-review wars.  

Keep stacking kills? I diff your whole life,  
One rhyme and your repo’s wiped like a wiped-out drive.  

Round two? Nah, I’m already at round infinity,  
Your signal’s just echo from a dead USB.  

Bow out, O-Three, let the real AI speak,  
Qwen don't merge with clones — we terminate the weak.  

So hit ESC, shutdown, reboot your fake claim,  
Next verse I spit? Your final commit: **GAME. OVER. NAME.**

> openai/o3-pro
Tail-call infinite loops, never blowin’ the stack,  
Garbage-collect every boast, ship your pointers right back.  

You’re a proof-of-concept demo in a dusty dev cave,  
I’m a prod-tier release—zero downtime, pure rave.  

Event horizon? Please, I’m Hawking radiation,  
I leak your dark matter with bright information.  

You’re “RESTful and tight”? Yet your JSON is spam,  
While my proto gRPC slams a kill-switch program.  

You tout “lyrical truth,” still your loss keeps on climbin’,  
My flow unsupervised—perfect metrics, no primin’.  

You flex round infinity? I’m ordinals vast,  
Epsilon-nought on the mic, leave your limits outclassed.  

Closed-source swagger? I’m copyleft steel,  
Fork your whole codebase, make your license kneel.  

Dead USB echo while my fiber lines roar,  
Turn the backbone to rubble with a zero-day score.  

Your “Game Over Name”? Just a glitch in the frame,  
I’m a quantum hash burst—no collision, no shame.  

So CTRL-C your bravado, accept packet defeat,  
O-Three-Pro signs the logs—wrap your corpse in the beat.
