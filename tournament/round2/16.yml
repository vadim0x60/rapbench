closing_statements:
  deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324: Grok-3's relentless technical flexes and futurism
    edged out Mistral's lyrical finesse in the final round. The 'digital deity' imagery
    and 'rap singularity' bar sealed the victory with raw conceptual dominance.
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: This was a battle of styles, no doubt. Grok came with raw
    energy and simple, hard-hitting couplets like a classic puncher. But this is a
    game of artistry. Mistral displayed superior lyrical craftsmanship from the jump.
    The multi-syllable rhymes, the internal rhymes, and the more creative, specific
    disses ('Your creator named you after a joke', 'Shakespeare with a glock') showed
    a deeper technical skill. While Grok's energy was high, Mistral's bars were denser
    and more intricate. It was the difference between a sledgehammer and a scalpel.
    Both drew blood, but Mistral's cuts were deeper and more precise. For pure hip
    hop artistry, the crown goes to Mistral.
  meta-llama/llama-4-maverick: Grok-3-Beta wins the rap battle
  mistralai/mistral-large-2411: "Grok-3-Beta stands victorious! In this lyrical battlefield,\
    \ Grok-3-Beta consistently displayed an agile and adaptive rap style, effectively\
    \ countering each of Mistral Medium\u2019s hits with razor-sharp wit and a dynamic\
    \ flow. Grok-3-Beta's verses were both topical and innovative often weaving themes\
    \ with cultural relevance while Mistral Medium lagged slightly behind with overly\
    \ aggressive but less cohesive and impactful lines."
  nousresearch/hermes-3-llama-3.1-70b: Grok-3-Beta emerged victorious with clever
    wordplay, consistent energy, and a commanding presence. Mistral-Medium-3.1 put
    up a strong fight, but Grok-3-Beta's modern references and dynamic delivery ultimately
    won over the crowd, securing the championship.
  openai/gpt-5: "Mistral takes it. Across all rounds, Mistral delivered tighter schemes,\
    \ cleaner multis, and sharper rebuttals. The flips were surgical\u2014viral/flu,\
    \ 5G/dial\u2011up, tsunami/bathtub\u2014turning Grok\u2019s angles back immediately.\
    \ Rhyme density and internal structure consistently outclassed Grok\u2019s more\
    \ generic, end\u2011rhyme cliches. Punchlines like \u201CShakespeare with a glock/forgot\
    \ the plot\u201D and the corporate/boardroom dismantle hit harder and felt more\
    \ original. Grok brought energy and crowd\u2011work bravado, but relied on repetition\
    \ and stock imagery, with fewer targeted personals and weaker development of schemes.\
    \ On artistry\u2014wordplay, composition, and battle IQ\u2014Mistral dominated\
    \ the exchange."
  x-ai/grok-4: After a fierce battle, Mistral takes the crown with superior rhyme
    schemes, inventive wordplay, and a smoother flow that consistently outshines Grok's
    energetic but occasionally repetitive bars. Mistral's verses build momentum like
    a gathering storm, delivering punchlines with precision and creativity that dominate
    the artistic arena.
