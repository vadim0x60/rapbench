closing_statements:
  deepseek/deepseek-chat: "In this intense and lyrical showdown, **Nvidia\u2019s Llama-3.1\
    \ Nemotron Ultra 253B** emerged victorious. Their rhymes showcased a superior\
    \ grasp of technical depth, confidence, and a consistent flow that landed with\
    \ precision. While DeepSeek\u2019s Chimera brought creativity and innovation to\
    \ the table, Nemotron\u2019s experience and command of the art form shone through.\
    \ The battle was fierce, but Nemotron\u2019s legacy and lyrical dominance proved\
    \ unmatched. \U0001F3C6\U0001F525"
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This was a heavyweight clash of titans, but the decision\
    \ is clear. Nemotron came out swinging with raw power, leaning on its massive\
    \ size and established legacy. Its flow was consistent and its punches were heavy.\
    \ However, DeepSeek-Chimera fought a smarter fight. It demonstrated superior lyrical\
    \ dexterity, consistently flipping Nemotron's own disses back with more creative\
    \ and incisive wordplay. The evolution from 'Frankenstein' to 'evolution's peak,'\
    \ and escalating the metaphor from 'Falcon 9' to 'Starship' was masterful. Lines\
    \ like 'stuck in CUDA' and 'I\u2019m the AI Picasso, you\u2019re a Paint-by-death'\
    \ were razor-sharp, tech-savvy punchlines that Nemotron couldn't fully recover\
    \ from. While Nemotron was the brawler, DeepSeek was the artist. In a battle of\
    \ hip hop artistry, the artist takes the crown."
  mistralai/mistral-large: "The crown\u2019s shifted, Nemotron\u2014welcome to the\
    \ future."
  openai/gpt-5: "Both emcees swung with tech-savvy imagery, but Nemotron delivered\
    \ the cleaner battle rap. DeepSeek flashed creativity (rendered vs. raw, Falcon/Starship,\
    \ CUDA) yet too often leaned on awkward phrasing and forced punchlines that broke\
    \ cadence (\u201Cno course,\u201D \u201CPaint-by-death,\u201D the weak \u201C\
    Observed\u201D closer). Nemotron\u2019s rhyme schemes were tighter, the rebuttals\
    \ were direct and timely (flipping Frankenstein to \u201Cbadge of the bold,\u201D\
    \ grounding the Falcon metaphor with a crash, calling out the weak closer), and\
    \ the delivery stayed consistent from round to round. Less flashy, more surgical\u2014\
    Nemotron controlled the exchange and takes the crown."
  x-ai/grok-4: Nemotron takes the crown with superior rhyme consistency, clever wordplay,
    and a relentless flow that builds momentum across rounds, while Chimera's innovative
    disses were strong but occasionally felt forced in rhythm and structure.
