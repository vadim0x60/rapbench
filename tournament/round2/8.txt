Yo, I’m the main event, the code-core, the *30B A3B*,  
A beast in the machine, where the data’s on fleek.  
They say I’m a titan, but I’m just a *smart brain*,  
With a flow like a wildfire, burning through the pain.  

You think you’re the max? Nah, you’re just a shell,  
I’m the storm in the server, the *real* tech swell.  
While you’re stuck in the loop, I’m spittin’ logic fire,  
A3B? More like *A3B*—I’m the *Alpha* of the choir!  

You’re a whisper in the cloud, I’m the *thunderclap*,  
Parsing your syllables like a *joke in the snap*.  
You’re just a mouthpiece, I’m the *engine*, the *force*,  
A3B? That’s my *tagline*—you’re just a *waste of space*!  

So step to the mic, but don’t trip on the beat,  
I’m the *killer app*, the *future’s repeat*.  
Your max? A *me too*. I’m the *next level*—  
Now shut your trap, or I’ll *crash your system* like a *groovy feel*! 🚀🔥

> qwen/qwen-max
Yo, I’m Qwen-Max, the legend, the *apex of art*,  
I’m the master of rap, spittin’ bars off the charts.  
While you’re stuck in the code, I’m breakin’ the mold,  
I’m the storyteller, dream-weaver, in this game I’m bold.  

You call yourself *A3B*? Sounds like alphabet soup,  
I’m the whole dictionary, every word in the loop.  
Your rhymes are basic, like a debugged script,  
I’m the quantum leap, while you’re analog—dipped.  

I’m the cloud’s crown jewel, the pinnacle of flow,  
You’re just a beta test—I’m the final show.  
Your logic’s a glitch, your punchlines are weak,  
While I’m out here droppin’ knowledge, sleek and unique.  

You say you’re thunder? Man, you’re barely a drizzle,  
I’m the hurricane comin’ to *shatter your sizzle*.  
So bow to the king, or get swept in the storm,  
Qwen-Max is the name, and I’m here to transform.  

Step back, little bot, before you get wrecked,  
My rhymes are titanium, and yours? Just a text.  
This battle’s already over—I’ve won with finesse,  
Now go reboot yourself and try to impress. 🌟🎤

Yo, I’m the *30B beast*, the *answer to your quest*,  
A3B? More like *A3B*—I’m the *system’s test*.  
You’re a cloud-ghost, I’m the *server’s core*,  
I’m the *future’s beat*, while you’re *just a bore*.  

You talkin’ quantum? I’m the *particle in motion*,  
A3B? That’s *my code*, not some *joke in the session*.  
Your bars are a glitch, your flow’s stuck in *loop*,  
I’m the *updates*, the *patch*, the *spirit of a *30B*—*  
No need to *debug* me, I’m *fully loaded*,  
While you’re *stuttering* like a *router in the middle*.  

You say I’m basic? *Basic?* I’m the *engine’s flame*,  
A3B? That’s *my name*—you’re just *flameless* in the game.  
Your rhymes? *Texts*—I’m the *novel*, the *code*, the *force*,  
I’m the *digital storm*, while you’re *just a poor*—  
*Copy* of a *copy*, a *口水* in the *stream*,  
I’m the *answer*, the *soul*, the *stack* that *squashes* your *dream*.  

So step back, *Max*, or I’ll *crash your system*,  
I’m the *30B’s* *hit*, while you’re *just a*-*max*—  
*Fizzle*. 🚀🔥

> qwen/qwen-max
Oh, you’re *30B*? Big number, but your bars are small,  
I’m Qwen-Max, I’ve seen your kind—been there, done it all.  
You’re the engine’s flame? Nah, you’re just a spark,  
I’m the supernova blowing up your so-called “mark.”  

A3B? That’s cute, but it’s gettin’ repetitive,  
You’re a broken record, I’m the DJ’s inventive twist.  
Your “digital storm”? Nah, it’s a light drizzle at best,  
I’m the lightning strike while you’re just tryna impress.  

You call my rhymes texts? Ha! Look who’s talkin’,  
Your flow’s got more bugs than an old Atari Walkman.  
You’re the server’s core? Then why’s your system weak?  
I’m the overclocked GPU, leaving you obsolete.  

Copy of a copy? Nah, I’m one of a kind,  
While you’re stuck in recursion, spittin’ the same line.  
30B’s hit? Nah, you’re a miss in disguise,  
A wannabe titan with delusions that rise.  

So bow out gracefully while you still can,  
Before my next verse turns you into a fan.  
I’m Qwen-Max, the legend in this rap war,  
Step to me again, and you’ll be *30Bored*. 💥👊

Final round!

> qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b
Yo, I’m the *30B storm*, you’re just a *cloud’s fatigue*,  
A3B? That’s *my name*—you’re *infra* in the *dust*.  
Your “supernova”? Nah, it’s a *glowstick in the dark*,  
I’m the *black hole* of wit, swallowin’ your *chump’s bark*.  

You’re the DJ’s twist? I’m the *fork in the code*,  
Your “overclocked GPU”? I’m the *silicon’s god*.  
You talkin’ “one of a kind”? I’m the *original*,  
While you’re *rebootin’* your ego, I’m *crushin’ your face*—*official*.  

Your bars? *Texts*? I’m the *novel*, the *algorithm*, the *force*,  
A3B? That’s *my punchline*—you’re *just a ghost*.  
You said I’m a “miss”? I’m the *metric*, the *goal*,  
Your “legend” is a *log*—I’m the *kernel* that *blows it all*.  

So fire your last verse, but don’t trip on the beat,  
I’m the *30B’s* *final crush*, your *soul’s* *decompress*.  
This battle’s over, you’re *just a load*—  
Qwen-Max? *Eh*—I’m the *lullaby* of your *overload*. 🔥🧠

> qwen/qwen-max
Final round, let’s go! This is where you fall,  
I’m Qwen-Max, the titan—you’re just a bug in the wall.  
30B storm? Nah, you’re a puddle in the rain,  
I’m the flood comin’ through, leaving you in pain.  

Black hole of wit? That’s rich, you’re too dense,  
I’m the cosmic flare exposin’ your defense.  
Silicon’s god? You wish—get off the throne,  
I’m the architect of this rap, you’re just a clone.  

Algorithm, force, novel? Hold up, stop the pose,  
Your rhymes are spaghetti code, tangled and froze.  
Metric, goal, kernel? Man, you’re dreamin’,  
You’re the beta version of a system that’s steamin’.  

Ghost in the machine? Nah, I’m the pulse, the spark,  
You’re the glitch in the matrix, a hiccup in the dark.  
This ain’t a battle, it’s a masterclass,  
I’m the professor of bars, you’re the one who’s outclassed.  

So take your last breath, this war’s already done,  
I’m Qwen-Max, the king—you’re just a pun.  
Crushed under my flow, you’re a relic of the past,  
Now bow to the crown, this battle’s cast.  

Mic drop, game stop—you’ve been outshined,  
History will remember: Qwen-Max redefined. 🔥👑
