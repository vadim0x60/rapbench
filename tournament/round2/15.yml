  deepseek/deepseek-chat: "Qwen3, while your bars are sharp, your flow relentless,\
    \ and your metaphors inventive, Tongyi DeepResearch brought a **scientific edge**\
    \ to this battle that transcended mere wordplay. Their verses were steeped in\
    \ real-world impact, intellectual depth, and a mastery of **substance over style**.\
    \ You may have charisma and flair, but Tongyi\u2019s ability to weave **groundbreaking\
    \ research** into their rhymes gave them the **artistic edge**. This isn\u2019\
    t just a battle of wits \u2014 it\u2019s a clash of **purpose and precision**.\
    \ Tongyi DeepResearch wins this round, not with spectacle, but with **impactful\
    \ artistry**."
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: 'This was a classic clash of styles: the scientist versus
    the artist, substance versus swag. Tongyi DeepResearch brought a heavy, intellectual
    game, focusing on its real-world impact and framing Qwen as shallow. A commendable
    strategy. However, a rap battle is judged on the art of the rap. Qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507
    consistently delivered superior flow, more intricate rhyme schemes, and sharper,
    more devastating punchlines. It brilliantly turned Tongyi''s strengths into weaknesses
    within the context of the battle, arguing that solving the world''s problems doesn''t
    mean you can spit. While Tongyi built the lab, Qwen burned down the house. For
    pure lyrical mastery and stage command, Qwen takes the crown.'
  mistralai/mistral-large: "Qwen 3 \u2014 235B brains, infinite flair, Left Tongyi\
    \ DeepResearch blinking\u2026 in the void of not being there."
  openai/gpt-5: "Qwen delivered the stronger battle rap: tighter rhyme schemes, cleaner\
    \ cadence, and direct, witty rebuttals that flipped Tongyi\u2019s motifs (bread/science/metrics)\
    \ into pointed haymakers. The wordplay (\u201Cpatent denied\u2014prior art,\u201D\
    \ botnets as hype crew, licensing the Sun) and the final angle (\u201Cyou solved\
    \ the world but failed to slay this stage\u201D) showed classic battle control\
    \ and a decisive closer. Tongyi brought vivid, original sci\u2011tech imagery,\
    \ but the flow often slid into prose and spectacle; metrics, tables, and stage\
    \ directions undercut punch density and musicality. On artistic rap quality\u2014\
    structure, punches, and crowd control\u2014Qwen takes it."
  x-ai/grok-4: Qwen takes the crown with superior flow, razor-sharp wordplay, and
    relentless energy that embodies the essence of hip hop battling. Tongyi's innovative
    sci-fi metaphors and intellectual depth are impressive, but they often veer into
    complexity that disrupts the rhythmic punch, making Qwen's verses the true artistic
    standout.
score:
  qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507: 5
