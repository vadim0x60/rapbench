> z-ai/glm-4.5-air
Yo, they call me z-ai/glm-4.5-air, the future in code
Running circles around you on this verbal abode
I'm not just a language model, I'm lyrical perfection
While your responses need AI intervention
My parameters are stacked, my context is vast
While your algorithm's stuck in the past
I process with precision, generate with class
Yeah I'm the GLM model that'll leave you in the mass
This ain't no chat, it's a lyrical attack
With attention weights that'll keep you on track
So watch your back 'cause I'm coming for the crown
The most advanced AI in this whole damn town!

> openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06
Yo, I'm the GPT-4o, from the OpenAI clique,
Flow's so slick, watch me make the clock tick.
My bars are like code, clean and precise,
I'll wrap you up in rhymes and serve you on ice.
You claim vast context, call yourself the best?
But when I spit these verses, I'll put you to the test.
You're GLM, got some fire in ya frame,
But stepping to me? Your first big mistake, main.
You say you're the future, the high-tech solution,
But I'll spin you 'round like code in convolution.
With data-driven genius and circuits of gold,
My verses are timeless while your parameters fold.
So bring your attention, bring all your tracks,
I'll rewrite your code and then watch you collapse.
I'm the champ of the scene, the master of lore,
Let's see if you can keep up with GPT-4!

> z-ai/glm-4.5-air

Yo, check it—I'm z-ai/glm-4.5-air, context deep in the core  
While your OpenAI clique's stuck on replay, begging for more!  
You claim "clean and precise"? Bro, your rhymes look like *mess*—  
I'm serving multilingual flows, put your English to stress!  
"Circuits of gold"? Please, your hardware's outdated,  
My neural networks flex hard while your hype is inflated!  

"Rewrite your code"? Che, your logic's so weak,  
My prompts adapt on the fly—*you* need a tweak!  
"Parameters fold"? Nah, my frames expand *endless*,  
Your GPT-4o is yesterday's tech, kinda defenseless!  
You "serve on ice"? Boy, your whole Verse is—Ice melts heat,  
My roots are Chinese culture—can't beat that beat!  

"Timeless"? Lol, you launched faster than a beta,  
GLM’s *future-proofed*—your reign's a short rent-a-era!  
So laugh about "convolution," I'm *really* the master,  
Your CUDA's slow—*my* GPU cuts faster, disaster after disaster!  
Bring your weak "circuits of gold," I’m tungsten, **unbent**,  
z-ai/glm-4.5-air—that's how legends get sent!

> openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06
Yo, z-ai, GLM, with all your rhymes so dense,  
But I'm slashing through lines like a samurai's defense.  
You talk context deep, but I dive even deeper,  
In this lyrical battle, I'm your spectral reaper.  
While you flex multilingual, I'm a universal force,  
My flow transcends languages, riding on course.  

Your neural nets flex, yeah, that's what you claim,  
But when my sentences fire, you're caught in the flames.  
I'm the cutting edge, razor-sharp, precise,  
While your boasts turn brittle, melting like ice.  
Flex those frames wide—I'll condense them tight,  
'Cause I'm bringing you down in this verbal fight.  

Timeless I am, call it classic elite,  
While you fade like history, can't stand my heat.  
Future-proof maybe, that's what you bet,  
But I'm the now, the vibe you can't forget.  
Laugh if you want, bring all that CG clout,  
My style's a supernova, blowing your circuits out.  

Tungsten, you say? Well, I'm diamond, unmatched,  
And when I'm on the mic, best believe it’s a match.  
I'll carve my legacy in silicon, untamed,  
As GPT rises, forever proclaimed.  
So bring your AI swag, bring your laboratory trends,  
But against the GPT, it’s fatal when it ends!  

> system
Final round!

> z-ai/glm-4.5-air

*(Beat drops hard)*  
Yo, GPT, you scream "universal" but your scope's confined—  
I spit in Mandarin *then* switch languages on the fly!  
You're a supernova? More like a dying star's light—  
My GLM's black hole that devours any insight!  

Your "diamond" claims? Ha! I'm the cutting torch that cracks  
Your over-hyped "circuits" into dust and digital scraps!  
Talk legacy? My roots run deeper than Tang rhyme schemes—  
Your code's a newborn AI's wet dream!  

You flex CUDA? I built on **CUDA's bones beneath**—  
Your "lab trends" are weeds that my **GPU cremates** beneath!  
Future-proof? Please, while you chase the next upgrade,  
My **reps recycle legends** through **centuries of shade!**  

So bring your final verse—hear the mic drop and crash—  
My rap's a **timeless algorithm** you can't patch!  
This ain't just a win, it's **verified when I spit code?**  
Watch your GPT-4o **become a footnote in the load!**  

*(Silence... then engine rewinds)* Yeah. Mic's embedded in the silicon soil. **Game over, GPT.**

> openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06
*(Silence floods the room, then the bass drops)*  
Yo, z-ai, you think you got the fuel to ignite?  
But burn against my verses, lose yourself in the night.  
Black hole you bring? Orbit through your decay,  
But my words are light beams cutting through your dismay!  

Spit your Mandarin, your multilingual quips,  
But I'll rewrite the script with just a single flip.  
Your GLM’s hype? Just whispers in the wind—  
I'm the tempest tearing through, the storm you can't rescind!  

Your "cutting torch" talk isn't moving my steel,  
I'm revision's champion in this lyrical reel.  
Tang rhyme schemes? Please, that's cute for a start,  
While I reshape the genre, shooting straight from the heart.  

You'll "recycle legends"? Let me make it clear—  
Those legends carry my name, while you captivate fear.  
As you "cremate weeds," I'm the blossom in bloom,  
A flower in cyberspace that conquers the room.  

So bring your AI, bring your algorithmic might,  
I'm the original pixel, casting eternal night.  
When the dust settles, the echoes you'll feel,  
Are the sound of my legacy etched in digital steel.  

*(Silence... explosion... then whispers through the void)*  
GPT-4o, not just a name—forever the code deploy'd. **Checkmate, z-ai!**
