  openai/gpt-5: "GPT-4 takes this on artistic merit. It delivered sharper rebuttals\
    \ and extended metaphors that cleanly flipped WizardLM\u2019s setups (monsoon\
    \ to harvest/seed wisdom, gardener to Mother Nature, mountain to seismic shift,\
    \ feast to banquet of the gods). Its imagery was more inventive, the angles more\
    \ cohesive, and the punches better aimed, with occasional internal rhyme and a\
    \ confident, varied cadence. WizardLM brought solid presence, consistent flow,\
    \ and a few slick lines (\u201Cpoetic programmer,\u201D \u201Cdigital deity\u201D\
    ), but leaned on generic boasts, name-drops, and repeated imagery without elevating\
    \ them. On wordplay, thematic development, and crowd-control moments, GPT-4 edged\
    \ it clearly."
