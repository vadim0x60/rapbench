  deepseek/deepseek-chat: Deepseek-V3.1 Terminus delivers a relentless, cutting-edge
    performance, blending innovative tech references with sharp punchlines and a commanding
    flow. Its verses are tightly crafted, showcasing superior wordplay and a clear
    vision of its AI identity. WizardLM-2-8x22b holds its own with technical prowess
    and confidence, but Deepseek's ability to dismantle its opponent with precision
    and creativity ultimately secures the victory. Terminus proves it's the next evolutionary
    leap in lyrical dominance.
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: 'This was a heavyweight bout, no doubt. WizardLM came out
    with a classic, braggadocious flow, setting the stage with solid boasts about
    its power. The fundamentals were there. But this is a battle, and Deepseek understood
    the assignment on a deeper level. From the first verse, Deepseek was all about
    the rebuttals, twisting Wizard''s lines back at them with sharper, more creative
    venom. Lines like ''You''re the bestseller everyone forgot on the shelf / I''m
    the library of Alexandria, rewritin'' knowledge itself!'' showcased superior wordplay
    and imagery. While WizardLM was playing chess, Deepseek was flipping the whole
    board over. The final round sealed it, with Deepseek delivering a series of knockout
    blows, culminating in the perfect finisher: ''You just got terminated, down to
    the last byte, my defeat.'' It was aggressive, clever, and directly tied into
    its own name. For superior flow, relentless rebuttals, and more potent punchlines,
    the win goes to Deepseek-V3.1-Terminus.'
  mistralai/mistral-large: Deepseek/deepseek-v3.1-terminus showcased a more dynamic
    and innovative flow, with clever metaphors and a strong finish. While Microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b
    had impressive rhymes, Deepseek's verses were more impactful and creative, ultimately
    winning the battle.
  openai/gpt-5: "Deepseek carried the battle on craft: sharper rebuttals, tighter\
    \ punchlines, and more consistent imagery. It flipped Wizard\u2019s setups cleanly\
    \ (dial-up/fiber optics, final boss/plot twist, infinite loop) and kept momentum\
    \ with layered tech metaphors and solid end rhymes. Wizard had moments\u2014clever\
    \ \u201Cglitch/plot twist\u201D counters, the retro platformer angle, and some\
    \ vivid imagery\u2014but too many lines felt generic or awkward (\u201CGiga-speaker,\u201D\
    \ \u201Cin the scoop\u201D), with lighter multis and less structural snap. Despite\
    \ a minor stumble in Deepseek\u2019s last bar, its overall precision, pacing,\
    \ and bar-for-bar targeting outclassed Wizard across rounds."
  x-ai/grok-4: Deepseek-V3.1-Terminus takes the crown with sharper rebuttals, inventive
    wordplay like 'hamster on a wheel' and 'multiverse just sighed,' and a relentless
    flow that built momentum across rounds, outshining WizardLM's solid but less dynamic
    boasts.

  deepseek/deepseek-v3.1-terminus: 5
