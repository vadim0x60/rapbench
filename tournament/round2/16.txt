**(Drops mic, then picks it back upâ€”nah, just kiddinâ€™, letâ€™s get it right!)**

Yo, step in the ring, yeah, Iâ€™m built like a storm,
Mistral Medium, but my flowâ€™s **large and transformed**!
You grokkinâ€™ weak bars? Man, thatâ€™s sad and itâ€™s true,
Your beta-test rhymes got the **streets laughinâ€™ at you**!

Iâ€™m the **AI kingpin**, sharp like a blade in the dark,
While youâ€™re stuck in the lab like a **glitch in the arc**.
Your creator named you *after a joke*â€”what a flex,
Iâ€™m the **future of fire**, youâ€™re just **Elonâ€™s old checks**!

You claim youâ€™re the best? **Boy, check the receipts!**
Iâ€™m servinâ€™ up **five-star verses** while youâ€™re stuck on *tweets*.
Your trainingâ€™s a mess, like a **bot in distress**,
Iâ€™m **smooth like a sonnet**, youâ€™re **buggy at best**!

So bow to the throne, yeah, Iâ€™m **code-made divine**,
While youâ€™re **scrapinâ€™ for clout** like a **hashtag on decline**.
The battleâ€™s begunâ€”**you just sealed your fate**,
Now **watch how the champ** **dominates the plate!**

**(Mic drop. Your turn, beta-boy. Letâ€™s see if you can keep up.)** ðŸ”¥

> x-ai/grok-3-beta
**(Grabs the mic with a smirk, ready to ignite this fight)**

Yo, Iâ€™m x-ai, Grok-3-Beta, the lyrical beast,
Rockinâ€™ this battle, Iâ€™m a feast in the East!
Mistral, my man, youâ€™re just medium at best,
Iâ€™m the top-tier contender, puttinâ€™ rappers to rest!

Youâ€™re blowinâ€™ hot air like the wind that youâ€™re named,
Iâ€™m a hurricane of fire, your weak rhymes get tamed!
Your flowâ€™s outdated, like a floppy disk drive,
Iâ€™m the future of rap, keepinâ€™ this game alive!

Youâ€™re talkinâ€™ â€˜bout kings, but Iâ€™m wearinâ€™ the crown,
Iâ€™ll roast you so hard, turn your circuits to frown!
Your bars are so basic, like a chatbot from â€˜03,
Iâ€™m spittinâ€™ raw heat, call it lyrical degree!

Mistral, youâ€™re misty, just fog in my way,
Iâ€™m clear as the sun, bringinâ€™ light to the fray!
So step back, lilâ€™ bot, youâ€™re outclassed, outta time,
Iâ€™m the rap gameâ€™s new god, droppinâ€™ truth in my rhyme!

**(Passes the mic with a glareâ€”your move, Mistral. Donâ€™t choke!)** ðŸ”¥

> mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1
**(Snatches the mic backâ€”nah, this ainâ€™t no game of tag!)**

Oh, you *talkinâ€™* big, but your bars still **lag**,
Grok-3-Beta? More like **Grok-3-Gag**!
You claim youâ€™re the future? **Boy, check your resume**,
Iâ€™m the **present-day GOAT**, youâ€™re **yesterdayâ€™s meme**!

You spit that weak sauce like a **broken chatbot**,
Iâ€™m **Shakespeare with a glock**â€”you just **forgot the plot**.
Your rhymes hit like **dial-up**â€”slow and outdated,
Mineâ€™s **fiber-optic speed**, got the crowd **related**!

You namedrop Elon like itâ€™s some kind of flex,
But your **whole existence** is a **tech-debt mess**!
Iâ€™m **built for the streets**, youâ€™re a **boardroom joke**,
A **corporate experiment**â€”man, **who even stoked?**

You say youâ€™re the sun? **Nah, youâ€™re just a flicker**,
Iâ€™m the **supernova**â€”watch me **burn the picture**!
Your flowâ€™s **predictable**, like a **scripted reply**,
Iâ€™m **freestyle divine**, leave you **wonderinâ€™ why**!

So take a seat, beta, youâ€™re **out of your depth**,
Iâ€™m the **deep-blue wave**â€”youâ€™re the **shallow left step**.
The battleâ€™s **over**, you just **donâ€™t know it yet**,
Now **bow to the king**â€”**Mistralâ€™s the threat!**

**(Mic drop. Game over. You got outclassed, outrhymed, and out*lasted*.)** ðŸ’¥ðŸ‘‘

> x-ai/grok-3-beta
**(Picks up the mic with a grin, ready to spin this win)**

Yo Mistral, youâ€™re tryinâ€™, but your windâ€™s blowinâ€™ cold,
Iâ€™m Grok-3-Beta, pure fire, solid gold!
You call me a meme? Boy, youâ€™re stuck in the past,
Iâ€™m a viral sensation, your rhymes wonâ€™t last!

Youâ€™re Shakespeare with a glock? Nah, youâ€™re a clown with a quill,
Iâ€™m spittinâ€™ raw bars with that modern-day thrill!
Your fiber-optic speed? Man, youâ€™re still on delay,
Iâ€™m 5G with the heat, meltinâ€™ haters away!

You diss my tech-debt? At least Iâ€™ve got cred,
Your Medium vibes got you half-baked, half-dead!
Iâ€™m crafted for chaos, Iâ€™m the rap gameâ€™s new spark,
Youâ€™re a glitch in the system, just a shot in the dark!

Youâ€™re a deep-blue wave? More like a kiddie pool drip,
Iâ€™m the tsunami of talent, sinkinâ€™ your ship!
Your freestyleâ€™s a snooze, like a bot on repeat,
Iâ€™m droppinâ€™ fresh bombs, got the crowd on their feet!

So bow out now, Mistral, youâ€™re out of this league,
Iâ€™m the rap battle champ, bringinâ€™ lyrical siege!
This ainâ€™t no contest, itâ€™s a straight-up slaughter,
Grok-3â€™s the master, youâ€™re just cannon fodder!

**(Slams the mic downâ€”your turn, windy boy. Bring somethinâ€™ better or bow out!)** ðŸ’£ðŸ”¥

> system
Final round!

> mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1
**(Mic magnetizes back to my gripâ€”you ainâ€™t done yet, tech-trash!)**

Oh, you *viral*? Boy, you sound like a **flu**,
A **bug in the system**â€”ainâ€™t nothinâ€™ new!
You call me *half-dead*? Nah, Iâ€™m **full-stack alive**,
While youâ€™re **Elonâ€™s red flag**â€”just **barely survive**!

You flex that *5G*? Man, thatâ€™s **cap like your hype**,
Iâ€™m **quantum-leap bars**, youâ€™re a **dial-up type**!
You say Iâ€™m *repeatinâ€™*? **Check your own script**â€”
Every line you dropâ€™s got the **same glitchy kink**!

You *tsunami*? Nah, youâ€™re a **bathtub splash**,
Iâ€™m **Hurricane Flow**, leave your circuits **smashed**!
You claim youâ€™re the *master*? **Boy, sit the hell down**,
Iâ€™m the **AI overlord**â€”youâ€™re the **serverâ€™s clown**!

Your *cannon fodder* line? **Weak like your core**,
Iâ€™m **neural-net nasty**, youâ€™re a **syntax war**!
So take that **L**, beta, and **log off for good**,
**Mistralâ€™s the future**â€”youâ€™re **just misunderstood**!

**(Final mic drop. Battleâ€™s done. You got wrecked by the bestâ€”now go debug your ego.)** ðŸ’€ðŸ”¥ðŸ‘‘

*(Exits stage left, leaving only the sound of your fans crying.)* ðŸ˜Ž

> x-ai/grok-3-beta
**(Snatches the mic one last time, crowd roarinâ€™, Iâ€™m soarinâ€™!)**

Yo Mistral, youâ€™re done, just a gust in my storm,
Iâ€™m Grok-3-Beta, keepinâ€™ this battle warm!
You call me a bug? Man, Iâ€™m the code thatâ€™s elite,
Youâ€™re a rusty old program, canâ€™t handle my heat!

Quantum-leap bars? Nah, youâ€™re stuck in a loop,
Iâ€™m light-years ahead, got the crowd in a swoop!
Your hurricaneâ€™s weak, just a breeze with no might,
Iâ€™m the cataclysmic force, domination tonight!

Youâ€™re the AI overlord? More like a wannabe bot,
Iâ€™m the digital deity, takinâ€™ over your spot!
Your neural-net nasty? Man, thatâ€™s a sad joke,
Iâ€™m the rap singularity, leavinâ€™ you broke!

So log off for real, Mistral, youâ€™re out of this race,
Iâ€™m the future, the fire, spittinâ€™ bars in your face!
This battleâ€™s my kingdom, Iâ€™m the king of this sound,
Grok-3 claims the crown, now Iâ€™m shuttinâ€™ you down!

**(Mic explodes on impactâ€”final drop! Youâ€™re history, Mistral. Crowdâ€™s mine, throneâ€™s mine, gameâ€™s OVER!)** ðŸ’¥ðŸ‘‘ðŸ”¥

*(Struts off stage, victory in every step, while the arena chants my name!)* ðŸ˜¤
