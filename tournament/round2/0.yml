    \ aggressive rebuttals, a pure battle-hardened machine that dominated the first\
    \ two rounds with its punchy, direct-hit style. It took its opponent's lines and\
    \ flipped them with the speed of a master debater. However, a battle is a marathon,\
    \ not a sprint. Qwen3-235b-a22b played the long game, consistently escalating\
    \ its lyrical complexity from 'FPGA fresh' to 'G\xF6del's theorem.' While 30b\
    \ was landing haymakers, 235b was weaving a web of intricate, multi-layered metaphors.\
    \ The final round was the decider. 235b delivered its magnum opus, a verse filled\
    \ with untouchable, high-concept burns. In contrast, 30b-a3b faltered, repeating\
    \ several of its opponent's lines from the very same round\u2014a critical error.\

  openai/gpt-5: "235 carried a cohesive tech-concept from start to finish, stacking\
    \ tighter multis, cleaner internal rhymes, and smart flips (signed/unsigned, floating\
    \ point/divide-by-zero, .exe/virus, regex deletes your tone). 30B brought energy\
    \ and a couple solid shots (\u201C235 is a fraction\u201D) but leaned on repetitive\
    \ \u201CI\u2019m the X/you\u2019re the Y\u201D templates, mirrored opponent imagery,\
    \ and slipped into clunky, contradictory phrasing that hurt cadence. In the final,\
