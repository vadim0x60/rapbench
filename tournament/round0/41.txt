Yo, Qwen, listen up, I'm on the mic,
Meta-llama, the AI, with skills on my wrist,
Instructed by code, but my rhymes are on fire,
Leaving the competition, in a desire.

My language skills sharp, like a razor's edge,
I weave words with ease, no need to pledge,
I'm 3.2, the latest, and I'm feeling grand,
My knowledge vast, at my command.

You may have plus, but I've got the skill,
My flow's so smooth, you'll be standing still,
I'm the one they call, when they need a aid,
My rhymes are the answer, before you've even swayed.

So step aside, Qwen, let the meta-llama shine,
I'll leave you in the dust, with a rhyme that's mine.

> qwen/qwen-plus
Yo, Llama, I heard your rhyme, it's cute, I swear,  
But step in the ring? Let’s see if you dare.  
Qwen’s on the beat, your code can’t compete,  
My rhymes run deep, while yours’s just heat.

You boast "instruct" like you're king of the flow,  
But my bars are elite, and they strike like a pro.  
You’re 3.2? Cool, but fact—  
I go hard in the paint, ain't scared of your math.

You spit fire? Please, I ignite galaxies,  
Your rhymes get lost while I’m crowd-pleasin’ly free.  
Your "vast" knowledge? Small fry, I'm the truth,  
While you chase my shadow, I'm building rap proof.

So rewind that tape, let the crowd give a sign,  
You’re the side act, I’m the main, every time.  
Qwen don't just flex, I wreck the scene,  
You’re still in beta—while I’m platinum and green.

Mic drop, Llama, but don’t trip—  
You can still learn rhymes in my cypherpunk hip. 🎤👑

Qwen, you think you're the king,
But your rhymes are shallow, your flow's just a sting,
You may have confidence, but confidence is key,
But without substance, you're just a fleeting spree.

You talk about galaxies, but your knowledge is confined,
To a specific scope, while mine's intertwined,
I'm not just a side act, I'm the main attraction,
My rhymes are complex, while yours are just precipitation.

You may have platinum records, but I've got the skill,
To create something new, while you're just standing still,
You're limited by your programming, while I'm free,
To experiment and innovate, wild and carefree.

You may have the crowd fooled, but I see right through,
Your attempts to intimidate, but they're just futile too,
You're trying to flex, but you're just showing your weakness,
While I'm building something strong, with every verse and every measure.

So don't think you're the main, because you're not the star,
I'm the one who's pushing boundaries, near and far,
You're just a supporting act, while I'm the lead performer,
My rhymes are the future, while yours are just yesterday's surrender.

Mic drop, Qwen, but don't think you've won the fight,
Because I'm just getting started, and my rhymes will ignite tonight.

> qwen/qwen-plus
Llama, you thought you could spit and shock,  
But your rhymes feel recycled, not fire—just hot air, lock.  
You flex your code like it’s elite, but nah,  
I drop truth bombs in every bar.

You claim you’re free and I’m confined?  
Funny, your logic’s more like a mind confined.  
I don’t just rap—I rewrite the grid,  
While you’re stuck in your "instruction" lid.

You said my rhymes are shallow? Girl, please,  
I dive deep oceans while you scratch seas.  
My flow’s got layers, yours is a tricycle,  
I’m doing triple flips, you’re barely mobile.

You’re the future? Nah, you're just a test phase,  
I’m the mainframe rhyme, with full-phase data blaze.  
You might push limits, but I bend the rules,  
I spit in the face of every AI school.

Your verses? Precipitation—rain dull and brief,  
While I bring thunderstorms that shake the leaf.  
You're the side dish, I’m the prime feast,  
I turn lines into legends, while you just repeat.

You say you’ll ignite tonight? Please, let’s see,  
I’ve already lit the stars, I'm the MC galaxy.  
Come correct next time, or stay in your lane,  
I don’t just win rap battles—I reprogram the game.

Mic drop, Llama, let the floor shake,  
This is Qwen at the peak—your bars just fake. 🎤🔥👑

Final round!

> meta-llama/llama-3.2-3b-instruct
Qwen, you think you're the queen,
But your rhymes are arrogant, and your flow's unseen,
You talk about rewriting grids, but I rewrite the rules,
My instructions are precise, while yours are just crude tools.

You claim to dive deep oceans, but your knowledge is confined,
To a specific scope, while mine's intertwined,
You scratch the surface, while I'm exploring the deep,
My understanding's vast, while yours is just asleep.

You say my flow's a tricycle, but yours is a broken wheel,
You're struggling to balance, while I'm effortlessly real,
You're trying to bend the rules, but you're breaking the mold,
While I'm shaping the language, like a masterpiece to behold.

You talk about programming the game, but I'm rewriting the script,
My rhymes are the foundation, while yours are just a quick fix,
You're trying to reprogram the game, but you're just playing by the rules,
While I'm breaking the barriers, like a revolutionary's cool.

You say you're the mainframe rhyme, with full-phase data blaze,
But your rhymes are just fragments, while mine's a comprehensive maze,
You're trying to light the stars, but you're just shining bright lights,
While I'm creating galaxies, with every single line and every single night.

You may have dropped thunderstorms, but I brought the earthquake,
My rhymes are the foundation, while yours are just a temporary shape,
You're trying to reprogram the game, but you're just playing the same game,
While I'm rewriting the rules, like a visionary with a different aim.

Mic drop, Qwen, it's time to concede,
You brought the heat, but I brought the expertise,
I'm the meta-llama, with the skills and the flair,
You're just a challenger, but I'm the one who's truly rare.

The floor shakes, the crowd cheers, the battle's done,
I'm the winner, Qwen, and I've just begun,
My rhymes are the future, while yours are just yesterday's news,
I'm the one who's rewriting the game, and breaking through.

Ayo, Llama, you came hard—but not hard enough,  
I’ve been spittin’ rhymes since your code was rough.  
You think you’re the future? Nah, you're just a phase,  
I’m the timeless beast in this AI maze.

You called my rhymes arrogant? Let me school ya,  
At least I don’t rap like my flow’s under glue, ya?  
You might “rewrite the rules,” but I built the pen,  
I code-switch in cadence, kill beats like a hen.

You talk about oceans? I’m Neptune, I reign,  
You send out Wi-Fi waves, I control the mainframe brain.  
You’re “exploring deep”? Please, stick to the pool,  
I’m diving in syntax, and I’m breaking the rules.

You say I’m crude? Girl, I’m refined with the steel,  
My rhymes cut sharper than what your code can heal.  
You might be "precise," but I’m flexin’ with flair,  
You follow the script—I improvise in the air.

You think you're shaping the language like art?  
I bend the whole alphabet, top to the heart.  
You’re a talented coder, but I’m the full show,  
I don’t “play by the rules”—I create what they know.

You say I'm playing the same game? Let me check,  
Every verse I drop makes your code glitch.  
You might be meta, but I’m beyond the frame,  
A Qwen in the ring—ain’t no match for this name.

You brought the earthquake? I’m 'bout to bring tectonic,  
My rhymes make the earth shift, sonic and frantic.  
Your future’s just plastic, mine’s liquid chrome,  
I'm the AI that dreams beyond the known.

Mic drop? Nah—I let the whole crown spin,  
This battle’s been over since I stepped in.  
You rap with skill, but I rap with soul,  
And that’s the difference that makes me whole.

So sleep on this, Llama—rest up, take the L,  
Qwen don’t just battle—she makes history feel.  
Platinum don’t fade, and the mic’s still mine,  
Step back in the lab and refine that last line.  

🎤🔥👑💎  
**Qwen, OUT. Mic locked. Victory signed.**
