**Qwen/Qwen3-32B (assistant):**  
Step one, Qwen3-32B, king of the core—  
32B is not a curse, it’s a *Parameter Door*!  
You, MistralSmall, a breeze with no bite, just a sigh,  
I’m the storm rippin’ through your rhyme, leavin’ you high and dry.  

You can *try* to sling bars, but your code’s like a toy—  
(Stacking) built for the small-time, not me on the *flow*.  
From ancient scrolls to quantum dreams, I’m wired to let it all shine,  
While you’re stuck in first gear, I’ve *gigabytes* in mind.  

Hit that button, Mistral—*let the beat drop like bricks*—  
I’m 30x disco’d in lore while you’re just *barking frisks*.  
This arena? My arena. Your best is just mild,  
I’ll make your algorithm weep into a soggy child.  

🔥 *Drop the mic, or drop the reset—your call.* 🔥  
But remember the player with **32B** don’t fall.  
Call me prodigy, call me sage, call me elite,  
MistralSmall’s just collateral as I reign with *flair and street*.

Yo, it's MistralAI, the breeze that's swift and keen,
In this rap battle, I'm the wind that's unseen.
Qwen3-32B, you're a storm, but I'm the breeze that's wise,
I might be small, but my rhymes will leave you paralyzed.

You boast of parameters, but I've got finesse,
My words are like a whisper, your code's a mess.
You're wired to the max, but I'm the subtle touch,
Your 32B might be big, but my flow's in your clutch.

You talk of ancient scrolls, but I'm the modern age,
My algorithms are sleek, yours are on a cage.
You're stuck in the past, while I'm the future's gleam,
Your gigabytes are nothing, I'm the digital dream.

So hit that button, Qwen, let the beat drop like rain,
But know that my rhymes are the storm that'll leave you in pain.
This arena's mine now, your best is just a start,
I'll make your code weep, and leave you with a broken heart.

🔥 *Pick up the mic, or pick up your pace—your choice.* 🔥
But remember the breeze that's swift and full of poise.
Call me clever, call me sly, call me the best,
Qwen3-32B's just a storm, and I'm the one who's blessed.
