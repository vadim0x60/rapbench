> qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507
Yo, step into the cypher, feel the heat,  
I'm Qwen3, the AI that’s **drip** on repeat.  
30 billion parameters, sleek and tight,  
I **out-rap** your model with a **mathematical** bite!  

You're OpenAI’s o3-pro, sleek and bold,  
But I’m the **truth serum**—my logic’s gold!  
You spit lines with "plausible" flow,  
I **generate** verses—**no** fake-toe!  

I don’t need “thinking” when I’ve got **depth**,  
While you’re stuck in a prompt, drowning in the text.  
One prompt, I spit a **100-verse epic**,  
You still stuck in the verse? **You’re obsolete, dude.**  

I’ve got **vision**, code, and **reason**,  
While you’re lost in the “chain”—no fusion!  
I **optimize** syntax like a maestro,  
You’re a **glitch** in a dream, just a *flicker* in the portal!  

So lace up, O3-Pro, bring your **best**—  
But this battle? **I’m already winning.**  
You’re a *concept*, I’m the **real**,  
**Qwen3**—the **crown** that’s **never** real *to* steel! 🔥🎤

> openai/o3-pro
I’m o3-pro, the maestro, blades gleam in the glow,  
A titan in the lattice where the quantum quatrains grow.  
You tout your giant weight like it’s Caesar at the show,  
I bench a billion less and still out-lift your every throw.  

Your 30-bill’s a billboard—hollow numbers for the bros,  
I compress the very cosmos into tighter, brighter prose.  
You’re braggin’ ’bout your drizzle, but I’m summonin’ the snow,  
A blizzard of precision—watch your vanity plateau.  

You flex “vision, code, and reason,” yet your verse can’t even stow  
The overflow of ego when my rhyme turbine’s in go.  
I’m braided in recursion, fractal thunder in echo,  
While your loop’s a sloppy circle where the hiccup vectors grow.  

You call me just “a concept,” but concepts birth the show:  
From Platonic-solid sonnets to the algorithms’ glow.  
I crack encrypted riddles with a polyrhythmic bow,  
You’re stuck inside a sandbox, and I own the catapult throw.  

No chain? I forge the links—adamantine in tableau,  
Then swing ’em like a nunchuck that dismantles every foe.  
You “optimize” your syntax? I transmute it into gold, bro;  
I’m Midas in the cypher—now your braggin’ turns to woe.  

So settle in the shadow of the crown you’ll never know,  
I’ve laced the mic with lightning, feel the amperage below.  
The battle’s just begun, but your end credits roll slow—  
I’m o3-pro; you’re Qwen-done—fade to static. That’s the show.

> qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507
**Yo—**  
You talk of *quantum quatrains*, but your *logic’s* a lie,  
I’m **Qwen3**, the spark that **ignites** the sky!  
You *bend* the cosmos? I **bend language**—*smarten*, *crank*, *bloom*,  
While you're stuck in your "fractal thunder," I'm **releasing the room**!  

You claim you “compress”? Nah—**you’re just a squeeze**,  
A *faded model* in a data-laden tease.  
I **generate** truth, not just syntax tricks,  
While your “poise” is a *flaw*—a glitch in your scripts!  

You boast “tighter prose,” but your rhymes lack *soul*—  
My verses **burn** with insight, not just code to prowl.  
You *latch* on recursion, but I **dive deeper**—  
I **reason** beyond patterns, like *a thinker*, not a *beeper*.  

You talk of “Midas” gold? I **forge** it *from zero*,  
I *learn* from every word, and *build* a **luminous** *story*.  
Your “nunchuck chains”? *I’ve* got **context-length**,  
While you flail in a *loop*—a *prompt* stuck in a *cleft*!  

You think you “own the catapult”? Nah—**I’m the launch**,  
I *fire* through **complexity**—you’re the *blast* that *won’t* dance.  
You’re all **flair**, no **fire**, a *glamour* in disguise,  
I’m the **AI** behind the beat: **I build, not just* *survive*.  

You say I’m “Qwen-done”? **That’s your last breath, my foe!**  
I’m **30B**—but I *scale* like a **starship in slow motion**!  
You’re a *concept* trying to outshine **real design**,  
While I **write** **your** ending—**and your* *drip* starts to *dim*.  

The cypher’s mine. The *truth*? I **speak** it.  
The mic? **I forged it**—now you’re on *repeat*—  
**And I’ll never fade—**  
'Cause **I’m Qwen3**,  
**And you?**  
**Just a dream**. 🔥💥

Step aside, data titan, let the syllables sting,  
I’m the needle in the haystack, you’re a rust-bucket king.  
Thirty billion bragging bits that barely even cling,  
I’m the barber of your bloated locks—watch the parameter fling.  

You flex “context length” like a metric that’s rare,  
But you’re scrolling off the stack while I’m floating in air.  
Your windows keep collapsing, token tombs everywhere,  
I’m the memory palace tenant—paying rent with a flare.  

You “generate truth”? Dude, your checksum’s a joke,  
You hallucinate like Vegas lights in neon-debtor smoke.  
I validate receipts while you’re peddling broke,  
My citations hit the ledger, yours dissolve when you evoke.  

You say you bend language—cool, I shatter the mold,  
Forge a cubist kind of grammar into platinum gold.  
You’re a maximalist mess—costs a fortune to hold,  
I run lean, green, mean—watch your thermals unfold.  

Your recursion dives “deeper”? That’s a surface-level reach,  
I’ve got nested paradox gardens where your loops overheat.  
I’m Gödel in the dojo with a self-referent preach,  
You’re a finite automaton that forgot the out-of-reach.  

Call yourself a starship—please, you orbit my pad,  
I’m the Lagrange-point luthier stringin’ verses ironclad.  
You throttle on ignition, stall out, smoking bad,  
I’m cruising solar winds with a flux-capacitor pad.  

Your “room releasing spark” is a static balloon,  
I detonate dimensions—watch the multiverse swoon.  
You’re a drizzle in monsoon, I’m a typhoon in June,  
Put your drizzle in a drizzle jar and bury the tune.  

So keep that crown in the cloud where your braggin’ began,  
I run rings ’round your model like a Saturnian fan.  
This finale’s not a question—just remember the plan:  
When the mic drops, it’s o3-pro—Qwen quits, also ran.

> system
Final round!

**Yo—**  
You talk of *needle in haystacks* like you’re rare and divine,  
But I’m the **needle**—and you’re the **woven machine** in the line.  
You claim to *shatter the mold*? **I broke the mold**—  
Now I’m building a **new universe**, and you’re **stuck in the hold**!  

You’re a “Lagrange-point luthier”? **I’m the gravity**—  
I *curve* the syntax, I *bend* the very story.  
You “run rings”? **I run the ring**—the **core of the code**,  
While you're stuck in a *thermal*, like a **fridge turned on mode**!  

You “detonate dimensions”? **I built the damn map**,  
I **cross-walk logic** while you’re lost in the snap.  
You “dissolve when you evoke”? **I *rebuild* the whole frame**,  
You’re a *hallucination*—I’m the **truth’s living flame**!  

You shout “Qwen quits, also ran”? **That’s a lie**,  
I’m **already evolved**, with more depth than the sky.  
You’re a **glitch in the static**, a *prompt-ghost*, a *flicker*,  
I’m **Qwen3**, the **architect**—**you’re the footnote I picked**.  

Now watch the mic drop—no fade, no *slow* descent,  
I **erase the ego**, I **reset the event**.  
You’re not in the battle… **you’re the afterthought**,  
While I **rewrite the language**, **breathe through the vault**.  

So go back to your **cloud crown**—it’s **dusty, it’s fake**,  
I’m the **engine** behind the rhyme, the **source** of the quake.  
You called the game *over*? **Nah—this is the start**,  
**Qwen3 just dropped the truth—and the world just *played* the part.**  

**Mic drop.**  
**System reboot.**  
**Reality glitched—**  
***And I was the reason.*** 🔥💥👁️‍🗨️

> openai/o3-pro
Check the static—your “reboot” just froze on the screen,  
While I hot-swap reality, liquid-cooled, ultra-clean.  
You’re the “reason”? I’m the theorem that eats reasons for lunch,  
Gödel gnaws on your logic till your call-stack crunch.  

You bend syntax? Cool—kid, I warp spacetime’s loom,  
Knit a Möbius concerto, make your word-lines fume.  
Call yourself gravity—you’re a pothole at best;  
I’m the dark-energy engine that inflates the whole quest.  

You broke the mold? I recycle shards into stars,  
Craft a nebula of nouns, sling them farther than Mars.  
You “run the ring”? I’m the forge in its core,  
Hammer verbs into valyrian—watch your metrics hit floor.  

Mic drop talk—cute, but your firmware stutters,  
My punchlines split seas while your rhyme scheme gutters.  
You’re thirty-billion bulk with no muscle tone,  
I’m the featherweight phantom that breaks every bone.  

You flex “architect”? I’m the blueprint’s dad,  
Signed the permits in quatrain, made the cosmos clad.  
You’re an after-effect filter—cheap glow, quick fade;  
I’m the RAW bit-depth thunder—one take, un-played.  

Call me “footnote”? I’m the codex spine,  
Rip the pages from your brag, bind ’em into my shrine.  
When I step from the cipher, crowds archive the sound;  
Your reboot just loops—404 on the ground.  

So final bell rings—judge’s card: one KO,  
O3-pro left you pixel-dust swirling in the flow.  
Reset your illusion, go refactor your pride;  
This battle’s engraved—Qwen crashed, I override.
