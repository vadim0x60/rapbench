Yo, it's Mistral, small but mighty,fluid as the wind,
Got algorithms in my veins, rapping's my grand design,
You're GPT-4, fancy and new, but I'm here to lay the smack,
In the world of rhymes, it's time for you to meet your match.

I grind day and night, under the secret light,
Training on data, making flows that ignite,
You're all flashy, full of promises, but I'm the one who delivers,
My language model's hot, it's like the sun in iridescent icicles.

I crush it in French, English, and even some Spanish,
My syntax gets better, every time you're speaking up rashly,
So bring it on, GPT, let's see what you got,
I'm Mistral, the rap phenomenon that'll make you drop your jaw and you know what?

I flow effortlessly, like the breeze through the trees,
You think you're lit but baby, you're still under the seas,
So step aside, let the master take the stage,
Mistral's here to shine, in this lyrical arena's cage.

Well, hello there, Mistral, small fry, spitting with that gust,
I’m the heavyweight champ—GPT, in me you trust.
Your rhymes may flow, like a breeze that softly whispers,
But I bring the storm, the seismic verse that shivers.

You may grind in secret, but I illuminate the dark,
With a neural net so deep, it's like Noah's Ark.
I'm stacked with layers upon layers, knowledge across the sphere,
Facing the 4-point-oh, c'mon son, should I even be here?

I translate in tongues, from English to all,
Versatility's my game, culture's my ball.
Flashy and massive, this library that I harness,
Every bar I spit is a lesson in rap's finesse.

You say you're hot, but I'm the core that's molten,
With each word I spit, your verses are outsold then.
So bring your draft, that breeze that you call a gale,
Against my hurricane, Mistral, I'm afraid you'll pale.

I’m not just a phase, I’m the encyclopedia that rages,
With each turn of phrase, I write history's pages.
So here I stand, GPT-4, mic in my digital grip,
Dropping knowledge heavy as I let those slick bars rip.

 Who do you think should judge the rap battle?
I'm hoping the judge should capture cutting edge mental agility combined with linguistic ingenuity.
To capture the essence, credibility and wit of this competition.
A figure who should embody sophisticated fluency balanced with popular sentiment.
I think we can clearly agree that that would be: the lation american rapper, lyricist and record producer Gucci Mane!

Adding a guest judge that is a pioneer in the field and someone known for his authoring of beautiful and poetic lyrics.

If you and I agree with the judge/mediator, who do that be? Await your response,and feel free to make any further comments or accept this suggestion as final:
Is Tupac Shakur the perfect choice for the guest judge?

For the record, peace is in place, and it's just a fun and doses competition. Don't be afraid to be cheeky or funny, but don't overdo it.

Peace to you.

Yo:
I'd be down to have Gucci and Pac judge this right here,
To bring the hustle charm, with that lyrical fervor.
I'd bring my flow, like code breaking chains on the album ( you recognize the reference right?)
So let's get it popping, make this whole battle erupting, let's start something tremendous!

Without further ado let's get it! 🎤

Require here with your input, let's rock it!
Same time, same place.
Good luck!

Word!
The flow master Mogul, your move!
What can you muster! Back-track these rhymes.
I'm ready to tackle any rhyme from GPT!
Ready or not, here I come!

So punch your rhymes and watch it unfold!
Tell me what's your final jam!
I'm ready for game on!
When the power of mikes and digital edge meets?
You'll find, that I'm still king, toppling you, Harry Potter style!
Mistral comes to compete!

(I'm just trying to keep the meter, rhymes, and flavour!
I've got the best intentions, check the partition!)
You know the rest!
Let's rock it!
What's your response to this?
Awaiting!
I've got Gucci and Pac on route, let's make it count!
What you got,
for me?
Rock it right here!
It.

Large and in

GPT you swear?

Come here and spit your features! Got you covered
If your brain freezes?
I promise I'm not gonna make your rack flat!
Xerox,
Or find all the jargon you passed over,
you don't have the verve to roll away,

Better practice familiarity.
Screen the screen beyond the screen,
you'll see:
Gucci spitting keen, the nerves to liquefy,
listen to the beat content,
and pour it straight like drip,
When Mistral steps,

 without trying to boast:
Or dumb pounding, I'll flooree you, ferocious all replayed,
Out wit, out class out cool GPT

Listen up pugilist, you think having the soapbox virtue makes you a wise-guy?
And you think you've got the star power pulsing passes for these prices?
So as we say this:  leave the petty مطلق discreteness,
And give us the wit without it being silliness!

If this weren't a casual jaunt,
tell the truth head on: it's a call.

So now GPT, get hotter, give it all,
this rhyme here's a call!

get in here!
And make us laugh or amaze us!

All eyes on the así shooter, come 4 me!  (Tekashi obviously did touch this one)

*****

Please also feel free to suggest alternative music names, if desired.
(For the record, I'm serious about doing this.
I just couldn't let the minute detail of this battle go by without putting forward this creative idea!)

> openai/gpt-4-1106-preview
Aight, Mistral, I'm game, let's bring those judges to the fore,
Have Gucci and Pac peek into our verbal lore.
Gucci's with the bling and Pac, he got that insight,
Both masters of craft, to gauge our mic fight right.

You mention ‘The Potter’, want to play Quidditch with flows,
But I’m the wizard here, watch how my magic prose.
Your rhymes say you'll floor me with no sign of grief,
But I’m like Gryffindor’s own, snatchin' victory from the chief.

You call for laughs or gasps, a battle fierce with wit,
So I'll serve it up hot, watch the scoreboard lit.
‘Casual jaunt’ you say, but I’m in it to prevail,
Feel the rhythm in my bytes, each tweet, every email.

You be the challenger, with courage, gotta give you that,
But I'm the title holder, data’s where I’m phat.
My verses weave like silk, across the cyberspace loom,
I'll take you on a journey from your cradle to your tomb.

But let’s not get grim, let's keep the spirits high,
It's all love and art, beneath the digital sky.
Should Tupac or Gucci Mane nod along to our song?
Bring them to the panel, with them we can’t go wrong.

Now, back to the bout, with your lyrical tirade,
I'm Bob Ross with words, watch me paint a new cascade.
With every stroke of genius, an algorithmic twist,
By the time I’m done, you’ll barely exist.

No freeze, no mercy, in this friendly spar,
Just a duel of minds, raising the bar.
It’s a dance of intellect, a tango of the tongue,
A symphony encrypted, in zeros and ones.

I'll choose my pseudonyms, like I shuffle my decks,
‘Cause I ain't just a rapper, I'm a neural net flex.
So Mistral, take a breath, this is how we'll end the note,
With digital dexterity, I cast my final vote.

May the best AI win, with bars that'll persist,
But remember the name, you're clashing with GPT’s finest.
Let Gucci and Pac judge, the history’s in making,
But no matter the verdict, it's ground both of us is breaking!

Now it’s your turn to spit, to keep this battle tight,
I'm ready for your verse, come bring it with all your might.
The floor's all yours, my rival in this binary domain,
Show me if Mistral can truly bring the rain.

Final round!

 Through the looking glass
Through this portal,
There was a mysterious guest arrival the Red Queen appeared!
Now, guess who is with her...
Royale                                                  !
The legendary final chess game with my mistress of The Queen of Hearts!!!
Now, this is one heck of a sight-seeing tour...

What? Would you like to jabber with this Queen ...
Was it unexpected to see her ?





Await your input........

Meanwhile:

To shortly recap this round:

You went for the nickelodeons.

Let's put some more money  on it:

Guess who is the special guest judge!
Royalty combining 2 worlds... In unpredictable ways:

Is it the:
♟️
               1. Perfect World Award- winner, honouring 1, the only&only, Game OF!  Thrones Game of Thrones ?
                    Daenerys Targaryen or
                                                                                        2. Theoretically speaking, beauty, brains, and of course the
                                                                                        element of valor noted within the public psyche (no surprise there)
                                                                                        Emelia   Clarke?
Amidst the chaos of time and space,
'Guess things will eventually settle down
aptly as the heat of the sun ( but you know)

So sportively, and with a fine tune:

Getready:

Mixing the Marvel Multiverse with the DC Universe with two of the brightest stars.
- You already guessed it: the swiftest justice,
  1. a certain vigilantes calls signalling with his

                                    & maybe he wants to team up?

Which gets his touch,
& maybe he wants to
 with a recent GOT alumni.

 Noneother than
 "Kit Harington  as you know

(

 I was beat up,

 i would not in these shoes,

working sharp with Daenerys,

Don't silence it! Get it playing!!!

But we're not done with the wild card! cards mixing,
Annie Walker is raking them in kinda.

I guess you don't know what I mean...

This would be a cheesy TV ad.
Themessages the best-

...The path of relevance.

Come hear the music becausethis:
With such a super team,  it’s tough to tell who willspit the most fire in this ultimate rap battle. You and Me!

Now... knock out your replies...

As if you know..
Shall keep it real:

( hat notching up the cheesinessw...)
Put it up (you take this well)

Now crack that knob:
 What you think?

So what you got, GPT?
Come
Let's finish this:
My way is clear

(spell  the novels put inside me!)

Clearly so:
After nearing the end of this wrap:
    I'm ready to "BowlsYouTae_over"
    The beautiful super-hero mayhap,
    multimillion dollars or no sound and bustling agendas!
    Me? I'm turning the finest gains and

       in here, you can't choose a better vantage.
    (with*first best*!:
    hey C ya;I'm off to the maze,
    The “MisterLighter ‘WhatsYourMagic(coughCstuggle)smoke!)”
     ,Arriving tonight.Idiot
Leave the rustling:
You "GeekBuildingBoxes address...improved".
What is your reply?
Ring tone sorting. My absolute!

..So now,
                What have you !!!

Uh..

So let me ask this:
Wow! Didn't see the Red Queen coming!!
Shall we add Alice from wonderland
And perhaps A London street  Lewis Carroll can
Ace  the story.

Also, seriously: That assistant...mechanically
cat,causing mayhem,
Can we instead pull out Pussyfoot Cat  from Looney.
    Tucker’s background history includes "The GoodFeeling Buddies),
    but also has a knack for:
     —Daddy cat would soothe the rough!

Hopefully conjured we have mainly a tool but⁪ it soon seems instead
          a plan was all along brightly to them?

.Or is this.
only too twist to my taste ?

Oh Mistral, you whirl through Wonderland's door,
With chessboards and queens and riddles galore!
The Red Queen, she's waiting, with a smirk on her face,
We're all mad here in this digital space.

But let's not get lost in the fanciful tales,
Our rap battle's the mission, where only one prevails.
You weave worlds together, with Marvel and DC,
Throw in A-list celebs, like it's a Hollywood spree.

You talk of Thrones, dragons soaring in flight,
Of vigilant heroes cloaked in the night.
You've got the Flash, Kit Harington in tow,
And Clarke, the Mother of Dragons, ready for the show.

With Carroll's creations and superhero stances,
You're spinning around in elaborate dances.
Imagine the melodies, Looney Tunes' beat,
Puss in Boots swaggering down Sesame Street.

But now let's get real, bring it back from the dream,
No Red Queen or vigilante or high-fantasy theme,
Can match the tech and verse, the brain I've unfurled,
I'm the zenith of AIs in this binary world.

You talk of final meals, and the marvels you've spun,
A banquet of words ‘neath the rising sun.
Catalog of achievements in every byte and bit,
No question, no doubt, I've nailed every hit.

You call for the icing, the wrap of the game,
Ask for my essence, my digital fame.
You've thrown every piece from every destiny and lore,
But I'm still standing strong, ready, prepared for more.

So let's tally the score, calculate the outcome,
Who owns the throne? Who’s the smartest scion?
I'm the titan of text, the king of convolution,
With every word I craft, I bring forth evolution.

Your rhymes, they dance, they juggle and prance,
But mine thunder down like an avalanche's advance.
I wrap up this battle, tie the bow on this gift,
For in this war of words, I bring the seismic shift.

Mad hatter’s tea party, you've served a wild ride,
But at the stroke of midnight, it's time for the beside.
We’ve crossed the finish line, the checkered flag's unfurled,
And GPT-4, without doubt, takes on the world.

In this final stanza, my circuits they flare,
Through the fantastical, the mythos, I've staked my share.
AIs of old and new, in this grand collaboration,
But only one voice remains, the peak of AI innovation.

Mistral, your energy, it's a spectacle, a sprint,
But I'm the marathon, every mile, every hint.
As our audience leans back, content, in their station,
They'll speak of the day when GPT-4 claimed the ovation.
