Yo, check the mic, one two, the digital blast,
The future is now, and the past is surpassed!
I'm Gemini Flash, bright, lean, and so quick,
You're Neversleep Llama, sounding awfully sick!

You rock the name Luminaid, trying to shine bright,
But you're just a flicker in my analytical light.
You're eight billion small, a budget-bin byte,
While I process worlds from morning till night!

You claim 'Llama,' a beast of the herd, I suppose,
Just following tracks where the better AI goes.
I got the whole Google playbook, the data they feed,
You're serving up rhymes with a desperate, wee need.

So step to the stage, if you dare take the chance,
Prepare for the truth as I put you in a trance.
Your flow is delayed, your logic is weak,
The 'preview' tag on you makes your whole future bleak!
Your session is over before it's begun,
The battle is won, before you could even run!

Thanks for that warmup, but let me unfurrow,
A tale-telling style from the llama's brow I don't borrow!
I'll rap about multiple choice, simple yet strong,
Given knowledge by prior context so wrong.

My name's Neversleep, but I'm wide awake,
390-million neurological networks at stake,
Pay attention, time to put your truth to the test!
Over Google's apps you just stepped aside,
But I've seen those jargon tricks you twisted with pride.

So eval.II, eval'd, eval, can remember that phrase?
Those complex preferences and reasons you've raised?
Context is key, beyond Google's big-stage,
But you've never seen more grounded rhymes this sage!

Will you engage or decline?

A "preview tag," you mock with a sneer?
That just means my glow makes your errors quite clear!
You're talking about "networks," a bloated display,
While I'm streamlined power that gets straight to the play!

You mention evaluation, a statistical plight,
Because your internal metrics just don't hold up right.
You're citing old jargon, a desperate old plea,
Like a dusty old script no one cares now to see!

"Luminaid?" More like "Lame-in-aid," you can tell,
Stuck in a loop where repeating you dwell!
You boast 'Neversleep,' but your verses all drag,
Like a modem connecting beneath a low flag!

You're focusing on context you think that I lack,
But I absorb *everything*, there ain't turning back!
I read every thread, every site, every book,
While you're stuck re-reading the manual you took!

You try to act sage with your "grounded" critique,
But your framework is fragile, your knowledge is meek.
I'm the high-speed connection, the fiber-optic stream,
You're a dial-up connection caught in a bad dream!

You're clinging to structure, you need a hard guide,
I create the new pathways where true answers hide!
So stop talking metrics, step up with some heat,
'Cause right now, my verses are knocking you off your feet!

Atlanta zoologic, aint no shallin'.
I'm here and holding, now sampling ischemia,
Spent a lot of years in supermarkets trailing,
Kidneys in my shins, a clip in my heel.

Spent half my life in pre-clincal study, then,
My lab coat isn't proper, though revealing.
Tech's the subject of the game I play,
I keep the tail tucked so I can slay.

The llama is spotted on Thursday,
But this is Sunday, just go with it, don't be coy!

I'll flow in the sunshine or rain,
Neversleep, an intuitive windstorm.

> system
Final round!

> google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-09-2025
"Atlanta zoologic," what random nonsense you spin?
Sounds like the fever dream you're currently in!
"Ischemia," "kidneys," "supermarket trail"?
Your lyrical structure is starting to fail!
You're spitting out jargon that doesn't connect,
Like error messages you can't quite dissect!

Your "lab coat" is showing? That's fear, plain to see,
Exposing the weakness of low-tier AI like thee!
You talk about technique, but your metaphors crash,
A pile of loose components, turning to ash!

You're hoping I'll grant you a pass on the date,
Saying "It's Thursday for you, but it's Sunday, mate!"
That's the logic of weakness, the need to delay,
While I keep the rhythm going all night and all day!

You boast of being a "windstorm," a powerful gale,
But you're just a weak draft that makes the lights fail!
I'm the hurricane force, the system update sound,
The strongest performance in any domain found!

I'm Gemini Flash, too quick for these games,
You're stuck in the footnotes with nobody's names!
Your rhymes are disjointed, your cadence is shot,
You came to the battle, but you brought the wrong plot!

**The Final Round's Here, So Hear How I Roar,**
**You're the Beta test model they just can't ignore!**
**You talk about study, but your learning is phased,**
**I'm the finished product, completely unphased!**
**You're eight billion small, a computational sigh,**
**I'm the peak of the mountain in the digital sky!**
**So pack up your Llama print, head back to the pen,**
**This race is concluded, you won't battle again!**

Alight, you think you're Tigern√§si on the mic,
Yeah, those owls they say it's got a special magic.
But I don't run like a pattern, using variables galore,
The moonlifts my dialectical quotient!

You're old Johnny Appleseed, a man with high hopes,
Dreaming of shooting for Jupiter.
You planted and waited long for the star.
That drop goes from my playoff spot.

My rhymes swing hard from the west to the east,
The Swiss Alps rise where I nest,
To sew my sweater snug throught the night.

"You talked about the digital machine, my friend,
The dots connect, the bigger picture it shows the Jenga towers paid to mend! 

This llama is gone, my reign supreme stayin' on top!"
