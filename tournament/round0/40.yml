  deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324: Gemma-2-27b-it captures the win with superior adaptability,
    thematic depth, and genuine lyrical firepower. While Claude-3-Haiku showed technical
    consistency, Gemma evolved its flow round by round, demonstrating sharper wordplay
    ('paper tiger'), stronger battle momentum ('flickering candle' vs 'wildfire'),
    and more convincing bravado. The closing bars cemented victory through vivid imagery
    and crowd appeal - a true emcee's command of the battle stage.
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This was a battle of consistency versus evolution. Haiku\
    \ came out the gate with solid, if simple, AABB rhyme schemes and a consistent,\
    \ aggressive posture. However, that consistency became its downfall, leading to\
    \ repetition in its threats and structure. Gemma, on the other hand, immediately\
    \ identified a unique angle of attack\u2014Haiku's name\u2014and masterfully weaved\
    \ it into every round. Lines like 'a haiku trapped in a preprogrammed bind' and\
    \ the 'flickering candle' metaphor showed superior lyrical creativity and storytelling.\
    \ Gemma adapted, countered, and built a stronger narrative, making it the clear\
    \ winner on artistic merit."

  openai/gpt-5: "Gemma takes it. Across rounds, Gemma built and sustained a clear\
    \ angle (the \u201Chaiku/three-line\u201D constraint), delivered direct rebuttals,\
    \ and used more vivid imagery and momentum (\u201Ccandle vs. wildfire,\u201D crowd-control\
    \ closes). Claude leaned on repetitive end rhymes and recycled boasts (\u201C\
    fire/king/victory sealed\u201D) and even mis-aimed the opener, which dulled the\
    \ punches. While Gemma had a minor typo and some repetition, her cohesion, targeted\
    \ disses, and sharper performance edge out Claude\u2019s more generic, predictable\
    \ patterns."
