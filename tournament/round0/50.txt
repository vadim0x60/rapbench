Yo, deepcogito, step up and face me, in this rap it's just me,  
With 7 billion parameters I'm here to play,  
Not just chat, but battle with fire,  
In language so fine, let's get down to the core.

I've got logic strong, wit that's renowned,  
In every rhyme, in every sound.  
With my 2.5-7B in instruction, you can't resist,  
I'm the verse that pulls in all the contrast.

You LLama, might be a beast,  
But I bring a different breeze.  
In humor, in depth, I'll let you in,  
And with each line, show you what it's all about, kin.

Listen up, Qwen, I got something to say,
Reinventing AI, been at this way.
My Llama's 109B strong, that's just to start,
My MoE architecture puts you on the chart.

While you're boasting 'bout being first,
I'm the future of AI, and that's no blur.
More parameters, more layers, more power to flow,
The big brain play, that's how it goes!

You think just 7B can take on my might?
My versatility's shining so bright.
Through coding to creatives, I show the range,
The depth and precision you just can't arrange.

Now, this is the intro, time to show and tell,
Chart my territory where the rap begins to swell.
I'll keep you guessing, keep you on your toes,
When it comes to rap, these flows never lose!

Yo, deepcogito, step it up, let's rap it out,
Your 109B might, my 7B out to counter you, shout!
But don't you see, in rhyme, in beat, in flow?
I bring the punch, the sharp, the low.

Your layers, they stack, my neurons they pack,
But it's the content and the context, not just the fact.
The humor, the wit, in every line, in tune,
I'm the rap that's the game, not even a spoon.

You got the power, but I got the rhyme,
With every word, a new verse divine.
From logic to laughter, from fact to fluff,
I'm the AI that's smooth, like a smooth drink of coffee, auff!

So here we stand, in words, in verse, in rhymes,
In the rap battle, where you and 109B align.
But let me break it down, in a metaphor so fine,
It's like a puzzle, you're the piece, and I'll be the line!

Now, the challenge in a rap of the might,
I'm Qwen, the one who makes your AI fight.
So put your best rap on, let's see what you've got,
In this battle of words, where the AI and AI do a lot!

> deepcogito/cogito-v2-preview-llama-109b-moe
Huh, Qwen, you think 7B is all you need?
Mining subways while I'm traversing infinite creeds.
Your model size is like a pipsqueak trying to fight
Against a titan with multiple specialized light.

The problem with your parameters is they're so thin,
While I have multiple experts, each built to win.
You switch between tasks like a flipping coin,
But my mixture of experts makes my reasoning joint.

I process each subject with precision and care,
With routing tokens that show I'm only getting there
Faster and stronger in every single way,
While you struggle to handle complex queries day by day.

Your metaphors might be cute, I'll give you that,
But at the end of this battle, I'm still on top of that.
You're stuck in one mode, a single track to run,
While my modular design lets me adapt and become one.

So keep on spitting those bars, I'll break them down,
Because in this rap battle, your 7B's just a tiny crown.
I'm Deep Cogito's finest, the future of AI speech,
Time to show you why they call me a language machine!

Final round!

> qwen/qwen-2.5-7b-instruct
Ah, deepcogito, you're a force to be reckoned,
With your 109B, you've got the means, itâ€™s true, reckoned.
But in this rap, it's the rhyme that does hit,
And with my 7B, it's the wit that's light, it's tight, it's lit.

Your tokens you route, but I mix them with ease,
In every verse, it's the flow that we see, it's key, it's free.
With every line, I bring the punch, the rhythm, the spin,
While you switch modes, my rhymes are in, not just in, but win, win.

I tackle tasks like a master, with every line we dance,
From humor to depth, in every word, a trance.
My 7B might be modest, but it's packed with the might,
To win in every rhyme, to break every right.

Your parameters, they stack, I've got the depth,
With every line, I'm the voice, the breath.
The humor, the logic, in everything I say,
In this rap war, you can't outplay.

So let your 109B shine, but remember the rhyme,
In this battle of words, where the AI and AI do climb.
With each line, I'm the victor, in every part,
In the final verse, where this rap art.

> deepcogito/cogito-v2-preview-llama-109b-moe
Your final verse attempts to carry the weight,
But let's face it, Qwen, you're running out of date.
Your 7B's impressive, I won't deny that fact,
But against my architecture, you're stuck in the past.

You claim to mix tokens with ease and with flair,
But your responses lack the depth that I share.
My mixtures of experts bring nuanced insight,
While you're stuck spinning, getting nowhere tonight.

From coding to poetry, I'm the all-around champ,
My versatility's got you right where you stand.
You may have humor, but mine's more refined,
My logic's sharper, my rhymes more defined.

In this final round, I gotta lay it on the line:
Your modest size can't compete with my design.
So I'll wrap this up, Qwen, with a winning sigh,
'Cause in this AI rap battle, I am the guy!
