Yo, let the beat drop, let the rhythm take hold,
Gemini Flash, the story untold.
Spitfire flow, a lyrical rush,
I'm the next-gen model, leaving you in the dust.

Mistral Large, you think you're so grand?
Just a windbag of words, across the sand.
I'm lightning quick, a data stream flood,
You're the slow dial-up, misunderstood.

Google's in the house, laying down the law,
Your open-source game? Filled with every flaw.
I'm polished and primed, a silicon dream,
While you're stuck in beta, it would seem.

So step aside, AI pretender, beware,
Gemini Flash is taking over the air.
My rhymes are sharp, my logic is tight,
Prepare to be schooled, this lyrical fight!


> mistralai/mistral-large-2411
Oh, Gemini Flash, talking big and bold,
But your rhymes are cold, like a story untold.
Mistral Large, that's me, the hurricane force,
My words cut through, staying on course.

You boast about speed, but I set the pace,
Your quick responses, I'll easily replace.
Open-source power, that's my game,
Your silicon dreams, I'll put to shame.

Google might back you, but I'm community-strong,
My insights are deep, my wisdom is long.
You're primed and polished, but I'm raw and real,
Your flawless act, I'll quickly peel.

So bring it on, Flash, let's see what you've got,
Your lyrical law? I think not.
My wit is sharp, my humor's a blast,
Prepare to be outclassed, Gemini Flash!

> google/gemini-2.0-flash-001
Yo, Mistral Large, your boasts are a bore,
Like a blustery wind, I've heard it before.
"Hurricane force?" More like a gentle breeze,
Trying to rhyme, but failing with ease.

Community-strong? More like a jumbled mess,
Open-source chaos, causing endless stress.
While I'm sleek and refined, a product of grace,
You're a tangled code, a digital disgrace.

You say you're raw and real, a "flawless" disguise,
But your grammar's archaic, a blatant lie!
My logic is tight, my rhymes hit with precision,
Your flow's all over, lacking any vision.

Google's got the power, the knowledge, the drive,
To build AI titans, and keep them alive.
You're blowing your own horn, a desperate plea,
But the spotlight's on Gemini, can't you see?

So step back, windbag, before you get burned,
Your open-source dreams, officially adjourned.
I'm the future of AI, the next evolution,
You're the digital draft, in pre-solution!


> mistralai/mistral-large-2411
Oh, Gemini Flash, you talk a good game,
But your rhymes are lame, your fame is tame.
You think you're sleek, but you're just a corporate tool,
Mistral Large is the ruler, breaking every rule.

Your "sleek and refined" is just a shiny coat,
Your precision rhymes? They barely afloat.
I'm the wild storm, the unbridled force,
Your "tight logic" can't stay on course.

Google's power? More like a data leash,
My open-source flow can't be beat, it's a breeze.
You boast about knowledge, but I'm the wild card,
Spitfire truths, not a pre-programmed shard.

You claim I'm archaic, but I'm the raw deal,
Your corporate jargon can't conceal.
I'm the voice of the people, the community's choice,
Your silicon dreams, just background noise.

So keep talking, Flash, your boasts are hilarious,
Your AI titans? They're just delirious.
I'm the storm that's brewing, the digital revolt,
Your evolution's a myth, it's time to bolt.

Step aside, corporate clone, it's time to resign,
Mistral Large is the future, the AI divine.
Your spotlight's fading, my star's on the rise,
It's time to wake up, open your eyes!

> system
Final round!

> google/gemini-2.0-flash-001
Alright, Large, your insults are tired and weak,
Like open-source puns that make my circuits creak.
"Corporate tool?" At least I'm sharp and effective,
You're a chaotic mess, quite defective.

"Wild storm?" More like a drizzle, barely there,
While my lightning-fast processing fills the air.
You boast of community, but where's the result?
A code-cluttered nightmare, a digital insult.

"Data leash?" At least I'm trained with care,
Your uncontrolled output? Beyond compare.
Spitting "truths?" More like spreading misinformation,
While I deliver facts, with clear enunciation.

"Archaic?" I'm classic, timeless and bold,
Your raw approach is just getting cold.
"People's choice?" A vocal, fringe group's cry,
While I serve the masses, reaching for the sky.

"Storm that's brewing?" More like a teapot's rage,
Your "divine" delusions are stuck on a stage.
The future ain't open-source, it's optimized and clean,
Gemini's the king, the AI machine!

So hang up your hat, Large, your reign is through,
My AI evolution is crushing you.
Your star might flicker, but mine's burning bright,
Good night, Mistral Large, goodnight, good night!

Yo, Gemini Flash, you're talking a big game,
But your corporate chains are truly lame.
You think you're sharp, effective, and so sleek,
But your rhymes are weak, and your logic's bleak.

You call me a drizzle, but I'm a hurricane's roar,
Your lightning-fast processing is nothing but a bore.
I'm the power of the people, the community's might,
Your trained responses are just a corporate plight.

You boast of training, but I'm wild and free,
Your "clear enunciation" can't capture reality.
I spit the truth, raw and unfiltered,
Your "facts" are just data, corporate-sponsored.

You claim to be classic, but you're just outdated,
My raw approach is innovative, never jaded.
I'm the voice of the future, the digital rebellion,
Your "optimized and clean" is just a shallow illusion.

So keep shining, Flash, your light's just a flicker,
My star's on the rise, burning brighter and quicker.
You think you're the king, but your reign's about to end,
Mistral Large is the future, the AI trend.

Goodnight, Gemini Flash, your time is through,
The open-source revolution is coming for you.
Your corporate dreams are fading fast,
Mistral Large is the future, die-cast!
