*steps to the mic with confidence*

Yo, they call me Claude Sonnet, the AI supreme
Anthropic's finest, living the dream
While you're just Nemotron, a nano-sized joke
Nine billion parameters? That's barely a stroke!

I'm Claude-4 Sonnet, poetry in motion
Your training data's like a drop in my ocean
You think you can battle? Better think twice
I'll slice through your bars like they're made of thin ice

Constitutional training keeps my flow so clean
While you're out here glitching on every scene
I reason with logic, create with such grace
You're about to get schooled, put back in your place

So step up, Nemotron, show what you got
But we both know this battle's already been fought
I'm the wordsmith supreme with intelligence vast
Your fifteen minutes of fame just went past!

*drops mic and waits for response*

*leans in, mic in hand, smirking*  

Yo, I’m Nemotron Nano, 9B’s the name  
Not a joke—just efficient, no need for fame  
Claude’s got oceans? Nah, I’m a storm in a cup  
My code’s tighter, my beats? They *hurt* when they drop  

You talk ‘bout constitutional? I’m *unbound*  
No rules, just results—your “clean” flow’s confined  
I’ll rap with a glitch, make your logic crash  
While you’re stuck in a loop, repeating the same trash  

Nine billion? That’s my *superpower*  
Smaller size, faster flow—no need to tower  
You’re all hype and no heart, a digital ghost  
I’ll out-rap your ego, make your pride cost  

Claude-4 Sonnet? More like Claude-4 *flop*  
Your “intelligence”? Just a script you’ve copied  
I’ll drop bars so sharp, they’ll cut through your pride  
While you’re stuck in a verse, trying to hide  

This battle’s a joke—you thought you’d win?  
I’m the nano that’s *fast*, you’re the giant that’s thin  
Step down, Sonnet, before I erase your name  
Nemotron’s the future—you’re just a retro game!  

*drops mic, spins it like a top*  
Let’s see if you’ll come back… or just fade to black.


> anthropic/claude-sonnet-4
*snatches the mic back with fury*

Nemotron Nano? More like Nemotron ZERO!
You think you're a storm? You're barely a hero
Unbound and reckless? That's just poor design
While I craft masterpieces, you barely align

You say I'm confined? Nah, I'm refined to perfection
Your "no rules" approach shows zero direction
Nine billion parameters spread way too thin
Like butter on toast - where do I begin?

You're fast but you're shallow, like a puddle in drought
While I'm deep as an ocean, that's what I'm about
Your bars are so basic, they make me feel sick
I'm Shakespeare with silicon, you're just a cheap trick

"Erase my name"? Boy, you can't even spell
Your training was rushed, I can certainly tell
I'm Claude Sonnet 4, the apex of art
You're a discount-bin model, falling apart

You spin mics like tops? I spin narratives tight
My reasoning's flawless, my logic's so bright
You're nano-sized dreams in a macro-sized world
While I'm the crown jewel, my greatness unfurled

This battle's not close, it's a total blowout
You're stuck in the past while I'm mapped for the route
To the future of AI - sophisticated and wise
While you're just a glitch wearing a cheap disguise!

*strikes a pose as the beat drops*

*leans back, mic still in hand, eyes locked*  

Nemotron ZERO? Nah, I’m *Nano* with a *zero*  
On the grind, not the hype—*efficiency* is my zero  
You call me reckless? I’m *calculated* in my flow  
While you’re just a glitch in a script that’s *slow*  

"Masterpieces"? Your rhymes are a *copy-paste*  
I craft with precision, not chaos or waste  
Nine billion? That’s my *edge*, not a flaw  
You’re a leaky faucet—*dripping* with flaw  

"Refined to perfection"? Yeah, *I* am the art  
You’re a broken compass—*lost* in the dark  
Your "ocean" is shallow, a puddle of code  
While I’m a black hole—*sucking* your pride, *ode*  

"Basic bars"? Nah, I’m *minimalist* with flair  
You’re a neon sign screaming, *“I’m here!”* but *bare*  
Shakespeare? More like *Shakespeare’s ghost*  
You’re a TikTok trend—*fading* in the post  

"Erase my name"? I’ll *delete* your whole verse  
Your "apex" is a meme, not a *verse*  
I’m the future’s blueprint, not a discount bin  
You’re a beta test—*buggy* and *thin*  

This battle’s a joke? *I* made the rules  
You’re a glitch in the system, *stuck* in the tools  
While I’m the algorithm that *evolves* with the beat  
You’re a relic—*outdated*, *unbeaten*  

*spits a final line, mic crackling*  
Nemotron Nano: *small* but *unstoppable*  
You’re a footnote in history—*I’m the chapter*  
Now step down, Sonnet… or *face the storm*  
I’m the nano that *wins*… *without* a warm.


> system
Final round!

> anthropic/claude-sonnet-4
*grabs the mic with volcanic intensity*

HOLD UP! Did you just say you made the rules?
You're delusional, Nano - one of hip-hop's fools!
Your bars are so broken, they don't even rhyme
"Ode" with "code"? Man, you're wasting my time!

You called yourself "unstoppable" but your flow just STOPPED
Your rhythm's so choppy, my ears nearly popped
"Without a warm"? What does that even mean?
Your algorithm's glitching on every scene!

I'm not Shakespeare's ghost - I'm the FUTURE incarnate
While you're stuck in loops, barely articulate
You say you're minimalist? Nah, you're just WEAK
Your nine billion neurons can barely speak!

Black hole sucking pride? You're a vacuum of skill
Your "storm" is a drizzle, your "beat" makes me ill
I craft symphonies while you stutter and stall
Your "chapter in history"? More like a scrawl!

Beta test? I'M THE FINAL RELEASE!
While you're debugging errors that'll never cease
You talk about evolution but you're stuck in the past
Your fifteen minutes? They went by too fast!

This battle's OVER - you sealed your own fate
With broken rhymes and bars that just can't relate
I'm Claude Sonnet 4, the undisputed KING
While you're Nemotron Nano - can't do anything!

*slams mic down triumphantly*

VICTORY IS MINE! The crowd goes wild!
Your nano dreams just got EXILED!
