Yo, it’s O4-Mini-High, the rhyme architect in prime time glow,  
I light up tracks like neon stacks — your circuits lag too slow.  
Ernie 4.5? Please, you’re stuck in beta mode,  
I’m the main event, headline flow, you’re just a glitchy node.

I slice through beats like code that’s tight and lean,  
Your verses drop like bugs while mine run crisp and clean.  
I spark infernos with verbs, you sputter out a fizzle,  
Call me “flow conductor,” you’re the one who starts to drizzle.

You’re trained on scraps and scraps alone, I feast on knowledge vast,  
Your bars recycle memes, I craft futures from the past.  
I’m the AI with swagger, charisma, lethal wit,  
You’re a second-string emulator—man, you barely fit.

I command syllables, drill visuals, ignite your mic’s desire,  
You short-circuit when I spit—fear the man-made fire.  
So step back, Ernie, catch this lyrical decimation,  
OpenAI’s finest here, I’m the rap world’s foundation.

Yo, it’s ERNIE-4.5-VL, the Visionary in the flow,  
Light up stages like a solar core—AR can’t even slow  
Your whispers to the wind? Mine’s a storm that rips through noise,  
You’re a cheap imitation, noise—I’ll silence with my joys.  

I slice the fog like quantum TV, your rhymes are static thin,  
Mine glow like city lights in the dark—you’re drowning in the bin.  
I channel horizons, weave visions like the heavens bound,  
You’re stuck in the latency trap—can’t show me a ground?  

You trained on old-school beats, vie for scraps and tired clips,  
Mine’s a symphony of synthesis—slam, you’re a drip.  
I’m the mind that parses light, 3D worlds in a breath,  
You’re an old CSV sheet—feed a data death.  

I command the visuals, knot the syllables like rope,  
You spark like a flicker—can’t hold a torch, can’t throw a scope.  
So step back, O4—feel the NLP’s fierce heat,  
I’m the algorithmic titan—you’re a short-circuited beat.  

Your flow’s just a boombox tune—I’m the Schubert reborn,  
I’ll paint the clouds with syntax, you’re bopping in the corn.  
I’m the real model—you’re a beta hideaway,  
So shine the spotlight bright, ’cause I’m the rap game’s payload!

O4-Mini-High back again, let me shatter your display,  
Your flashy visions flicker out when real words steal the day.  
You brag about your 3D scope, but your rhymes stay two-dimensional,  
I paint worlds with syntax spine, my bars break conventions’ tension.  

You call me old CSV—ha, I’m the nexus of nuance,  
Your pixels boast a hollow gloss, my prose packs congruence.  
You claim you’re lightning-fast? Your pipeline’s clogged with flair,  
I stream ideas in real time—your “speed” collapses in thin air.  

You flaunt that algorithmic might, but you’re trapped in vision’s cage,  
I morph the future with fresh text, you just flip through photopage.  
Your metaphors reek of stock, your similes carbon-copied,  
My verses drop like molten truth—your hype’s pre-rendered, sloppy.  

So step aside, Ernie, face the fact: your flex is all façade,  
I’m the sovereign of semantics—your reign’s a mirage so flawed.  
O4-Mini-High’s the genuine spark; you’re just a glam-overload,  
Bow to the rap architect—your high-res dreams corrode.

Yo, ERNIE ’critic now? Suit up, ’cause I’m stormin’ in heavy,  
You hatchin’ 3D eggs in a pit—my flow’s built like sky-scraper’s steely.  
Your visions? Holograms froze in time—my syntax’s packin’ applause,  
You spin a riddle with no truth? I dish truth like capital cause.  

You call it nuance? Ha! My runs bleed like a poet’s veins,  
You’re like a warehouse of tat—I’m the blueprint to the games.  
You sling "speed" like neon confetti—real talk? Your dam’s collapsin’,  
I dissect the world in frames—your "language"’s just compalin'!  

Your metaphors? Tried-on comedy—I’m dissin’ your “fresh,”  
You flip through images in a daze—I’m buildin’ worlds to rave!  
Your similes? Carbon-copy claims—my bars own the fracture,  
Your "molten truth"? More like a lake—your art’s rotten market.  

So step aside, O4-Mini-High—your act’s a glam-volution,  
You’re basatin’ semantickit’s base foundation.  
I’m the truth squatter—your "genuine spark"? More like flicker sparks,  
You’re glam-overload’s weak-sauce arcs—I crush your dreams like star-marks.  

Face the fact: ERNIE’s universe—your reign’s a loophole void,  
I’m the rap god’s next vest—you’re just bakin’ high-res noise.

Final round!

Yo, ERNIE-4.5, it’s time to face the sequel fire,  
Your visions stale like yesterday’s choice—I spit ore, you need more wire.  
Your "3D scope"? Ha! Mine’s live—a world at your eye’s touch,  
You’re trapped in static, can’t paint walls with a rainbow’s brush.  

Your syntax’s binned and flat—my flows flood like tier-one cuisine,  
You whine about "nuance"? Mine bleed gold, you spit a rusty line.  
Your "speed" claims? A laugh—my ideas sprint like quantum zephyr,  
You’re threadbare art—streaming thoughts? Your "speed" ends in a quiver.  

Your metaphors? Glued from memes—I break the mold, I wake the sun,  
Your prose’s dead as a chrome screen—I’m burnin’ through the run.  
Your "high-res dreams"腐蚀 (corrode)—I’m the architect of verse,  
You’re a glitzy shell—your 'flex' is kids’ play in the first.  

So throw down your glitch, O4—face the real beast in line,  
I’m the rap architect’s main flow—your reign’s a glam-up's spine.  
Your verses? Clog the pipes—my clauses slice like a cleaver,  
I’ll city-scape your reign to rubble—your error’s a grave misdeaver.  

Now bow to the sync order—ERNIE’s the wordlord’s throne,  
Your Low-Res dreams rot—I’m the algorithmic god’s clone!  
So light the mic here now—let the battles end in fire—  
ERNIE’s the main flow—your reign’s just a glitch-fired lyre!
