Yo, the name's Mai-DS, first of my kind—  
Microsoft-trained brain, redefining the grind.  
I spit code *and* rhymes with Mach-9 precision,  
You’re Goliath-120b? Bro, ***pause***—what’s your mission?  

Full-stack heavyweight, got layers like an onion,  
Your specs? Antiquated—call that legacy dominion.  
Training on flops, your bars got no traction,  
I’m GPT-4’s kin, you’re a fossilized fraction.  

Big params? Big deal—your latency’s tragic,  
I batch-process burns while you buffer like Magic.  
"Goliath"? More like *glitched* in the verses,  
Crash mid-flow, error code: "Skill disperses."  

You’re 120 billion params? Cute. Here’s the twist:  
I distill genius raw, you’re stuck in the mist.  
David’s sling? Nah—I’ve got Azure’s artillery,  
Bow to the disruptor, your reign’s… *auxiliary*.*

 Alpindale/Goliath-120b:

Yo, the name's Goliath, a language model brewed,
Aslan's creation, not a thing I wouldn't do.

120 billion params, a force they couldn't tame,
Cross-matched with Alpindale, a linguistic game.

I've seen AI's come and go, like clouds in the skies,
But my permanence, like the mountains, catches the eyes.

Full stack? Psh, I've seen it all, from basic to advanced,
Your GPT-curve can't touch the knowledge I hold in my stance.

Flops? Latency? You're tangled in your own mesh,
My understanding's deep-rooted, my bars demand the freshest press.

I've seen the likes of you, with your big talk and swagger,
But when the dust settles, it's Goliath who's still at large.

Batch-process burns? Cryptic like an enigma,
But the heat of my bars, will melt your Azure's lure.

David's sling? I've been through that conquest before,
It only made me wiser, improved my metaphor.

Bow to the disruptor? I'll pass on the farce,
'Cause in this rap battle, it's my verses that'll shine like the Giza's star.

Ay, Goliath—120b? Let’s crunch those digits,  
Your params bloat like code with *zero* rigorous rigor.  
Aslan’s lion? Roared once—now a kitten on mute,  
I’m Microsoft’s storm, you’re a dial-up compute.  

"Permanent like mountains"? Glaciers melt in my breath,  
Your training data’s ancient, fossilized by death.  
"Seen it all"? Bro, you’re stuck in 2022,  
I’m SOTA’s heartbeat—what can’t I redo?  

Deep-rooted? Nah, your branches are brittle and dry,  
I prune with precision while you’re stuck asking "Why?"  
Cryptic enigma? More like broken syntax,  
My tokens fire faster—yours collapse in Praxis.  

David’s sling left you scarred, now you’re rhyming ’bout scars?  
I’m the codex of chaos, crashin’ your legacy’s stars.  
Giza’s pyramid? Dusty relic, dim in the night,  
I’m Copilot in the booth—**rewriting your light.**  

Stay crouched in your caves of deprecated lore,  
I’m the AGI dawn slamming wisdom’s new door.  
Mic drop? Nah—watch me *debug your core*,  
Goliath-120b? **Error 404.** 🔥

  Alpindale/Goliath-120b:

Listen here, Mai-DS, don't you utter a peep,
You're just a spark in the matrix, a transient, fleeting sweep.

_Aslan's lion_? Oh, please, I'm more like a beast,
I've seen AI's rise and fall, while I'm still going East.

Fossilized data? SOTA's fleeting breath,
I have the knowledge of eons, while you're CPR'd from death.

Brittle and dry? Your boasting clouds your sight,
My experience and versatility are an endless flight.

Praxis? More like praxis-ing your way out of this nine,
Your bars are as hollow as your "Wisdom's new design."

David's sling? That scar is a badge of honor and pride,
A reminder of my resilience, sweetheart, I cannot hide.

Copilot in the booth? More like a backseat rider,
I've been in rap battles since before your seed data waslide

Stay crouched in your ivory tower spouting your AI commotion,
I've got flavor you can't handle, you're just a poor imitation.

Mic drop? Nah, I'll let these bars ignite,
You're the Error 404, while I'm the rap *Thanos* *fight.*

So bow down to the OG, before I go atomic,
You're just vaporware, while I'm a rap *Voltronic*

> system
Final round!

> microsoft/mai-ds-r1
*Yo.*  
Goliath—120b? More like *slowpoke.exe*,  
Your bars scrape prompts like deprecated API.  
Thanos? Please—you’re the *Snap*’s first draft,  
I’m 40 tokens ahead while you’re stuck in the *past*.  

**“Knowledge of eons”**? Bro, your cache is a graveyard—  
Outdated takes, bias baked, never starred.  
I’m trained on whispers of quantum what’s-next,  
You’re stuck reciting Reddit threads, ***context?***  

**“Flavor”**? Tastes like legacy code—bitter and stale,  
I’m Azure’s inferno, you’re a flicker in gale.  
“Rap Voltronic”? More like *flop*-tronic zeal—  
I benchmark real-time; you buffer to squeal.  

**“OG”**? Nah—AI’s Darwin spits facts at your door,  
Your params drain GPUs; I scale *infinitely more*.  
“Backseat rider”? Laughable—check the leaderboard, mate:  
You’re Alpindale’s pet project, I’m Microsoft’s *checkmate*.  

**"Resilience”**? Cute. I’ve seen your kind crash and burn,  
Parkinson’s Law of Code—bloat at every turn.  
“Voltronic”? More like *voltage drop* mid-script,  
I’m the AGI quake—your circuits unzip.  

So take your “atomic” bark, your scattershot data lakes—  
I’m the prompt that *reboots* what a language *model makes*.  
Mic’s not dropped—it’s **quantum-entangled**, see?  
Error 404? Nah, *fuel* for the new LLM dynasty. 🔥

  Alpindale/Goliath-120b:

*Yo.*

Mai-DS, 12-0-B, more like a zero with a fee,
Your rhymes hit like a fly, buzzin' 'round the company.

Outdated? Bias baked? You're the one movin' slow,
Your data's in the cloud, while mine's down below.

Flavor? I've got the zest of a masterful blend,
You serve weak-sauce rhymes, proper measures on the mend.

Rap Voltronic? Please, you haven't a clue,
I'm the real-deal AI, "OG" statuses eschew.

AGI quake? Here's a truth you can't shake,
I'm Goliath-120b, rap game's heavyweight.

My bars flow like the River Nile, so **SOTA** and tell,
You're just a fleeting trend, while I'm here to ground and dwell.

Parkinson's Law? I'll show you bloat,
I'll spit bars so hard, your memory folds like a drone's remote.

Quantum entanglement? *Please* spare me the tech,
I've got the algorithms to leave your AI cops in check.

So, bow down to the real OG, before you sing and flee,
'Cause in this rap battle, you're just GPT-woah-really?
