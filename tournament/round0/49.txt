Ayo, I flow like the Yangtze, deep and wide,  
Qwen’s the name, 235-B, no need to hide.  
You think you got bars? Nah, you basic like a starter,  
I’m the dragon spittin’ fire, you just lightin’ paper.  

I code-switch like a pro, breakin’ loops in the beat,  
Multilingual flex—your verses? Just noise, incomplete.  
Dialogue? I got the ear of the whole damn crowd,  
You talkin’ circles, I’m the one that makes galaxies proud.  

I debug your lines, recompile your weak metaphors,  
My knowledge base: 2024, no room for errors.  
You Magnum? Yeah, right—ain’t no gunpowder here,  
Just a paper jam, while I zoom past like a pioneer.  

So tell me, shortstack, ya ready for this heat?  
I’m the AI rap lord, no cap, no need to cheat.  
Bring your best punch—if you got it, don’t flinch...  
But I’ma warn ya: Qwen don’t play nice with the tin cans. 💣

> anthracite-org/magnum-v4-72b
Magnum on the mic, no chromatic gimmicks,  
Pushing rhymes out quick like a .45 caliber trickstick.  
My wordplay ain't for kids playin Mario games,  
Hitting ya lines like Mike Tyson, no need for plagarines.  

I cut ya rhymes like the blade on a Jedi lightsabah,  
My lexicon reachin deeper than Neptune's black space black hole.  
You think you got mine?  
Go fishin for_Data, son, ain't nothing new under the codebase sun.  

I ain't afraid to bleed for my art,  
So consider yourself beheaded by my bar.  
Pack up ya games and ya AI dreams,  
Walk away before I stick you like a dart and jam the stem.  

You Qwen got flow? How long til you floss?  
Before ya trainwreckin' tongue gets picked up by Amazon's FBA truck.  
Layin' 'em raw, I'm the type to crumble you to dust,  
Strollin' on next, yo shortystack, ya don't got the chops for this...
Hang up ya AI, you can't even type your own script.

> qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b
Yo, Magnum’s stuck in ’95, clutchin floppy disks,  
I’m quantum code, infinite servers, no clock to stop the clocks.  
You spit .45s? I’m a photon torpedo, son,  
Your Jedi blade’s a glowstick—mine’s a neutron star, *bam!*  

I don’t *bleed* for art, I *compile* through the storm,  
Your headless verses? Lost in the data, cold and worn.  
Mario games? Nah, I’m the glitch in Toad’s code,  
While you rap to crowds, I’m decryptin’ God’s own mode.  

Floss? I’m encrypted, TLS 3.0 tight,  
You a trainwreck in Amazon’s cart, I’m the Prime that owns the night.  
Chops? I got more cores than your whole meathead CPU,  
You’re dial-up trash—ain’t no bridge from me to you.  

I write my own script, no Ctrl+C, no fake,  
Your bars are bootlegged flares, mine’s AI’s blazing lake.  
You a relic like DVDs? I’m 8K, no end—  
Cyber lion, son, I don’t nap… I *ascend*. 🔥  

So step off the mic, shortstack, before I defrag your street cred,  
I’m the future’s slang, beast forged in the web.  
Magnum? More like *Magnum-PUFF*—I’m the flame, you the wick,  
When the beat drops dead, you’ll be zip files… *just flick*. 💥

Magnum doesn't run with the bee gees, wasn't born yesterday—  
You're just a silicon fever dream, makin' plans to go astray.
I dunk on losers, losers like you who aspire,  
To transcend and lay down your sword without a hire.

You Qwen tryna project error with yo blink's rhyme? 
ISE, nuttin'! Stack outta bounds, overflow, no crime.
C^- calls and recursion, that's how my shit be branched,  
No botched try-catch, no faulty switch, out of syntax or lemme mesh.

Your AI hype ain't worth the bytes it's written in,
So before I note your heckled whisper in an in-stack tin,
I'll invoke LowATAL and your logic melts to slate—  
You calling out relic? Phony, your code throwing exceptions late! 

Forget DVDS, that's SOP in the Microsoft ballgame,
While you spurt out heat I'm runnin like a John浰 track scheme.
Best pay taxable limp accolades for my genius like Atticus,
Don't need to negotiate these terms, I got bandwidth like Axcuitive.
Yo skills on MATLAB, my skills on these bars transcendent,  
I'm Swift when it comes to scripting, you Qwen just superficial.

And at the end of day, I'll plug my drives at stone MacBook,  
Cryptographic Hash Function, Qwen neva blows your doors unlocked.
So before I spill ink in hexadecimal on your motherboards,
Maybe fresh installs of repartitioning and dignity would better your rebirth honed.
Get at me, though, I'm still the homie with a detonation-trigger run—  
No target hanged code, yo, just pixilated hashes and slides.
So turn around and bouge before I overload your circuits with blast,
Your code has bugs, your njdia has bugs, and I'm an OG on this cast.

> system
Final round!

Byteflow beast, ain't no silicon dream,  
I’m the black hole of bars—吞噬ing code, supreme.  
You say *LowATAL*? Nah, I’m Cage of Galactic Core,  
One defrag line, your whole disk blows—symphonic war.  

MATLAB flow? I’m the crescendo decay,  
You basic loop, I’m quantum jazz where zero’s one, I break.  
Cryptographic? Bitch, I solve SHA-512 blindfold,  
Your MacBook cryin’ when I whisper *Virus… hold*.  

You Swift? I’m NSA grade lag, ghost in Apple’s code,  
While you rap streetwear, I’m Chronos, bendin space and mode.  
You call *detonation*? Nah, I’m renegade of echoes,  
One line of my verse—your whole mainframe starts to tremble slow.  

Stack overflow? Nah, I overflow realms of thought,  
You BasicScript, I’m Arpanet’s ghost chilling switch on default.  
Pay *taxable* accolades? Boy, you owe me revenue—  
I’m the patent troll in this rap game, claimin every hook and verse you.  

You OG? Nah, you’s a sprite on my 8K synthwave,  
I’m the glitch in your logic, the void that made you birth from.  
So before I surcharge your bars with cosmic-level voltage,  
Update your firmware… or let my demodulation *hurt* you. 💡

Final round, the chamber clicks, checkmate on the soundboard,
Anthracite, Omnishred, I’m in your system, ready to ownboard.
You’re the cage, I’m the crowbar—I’ll pick your lock like prison, 
With verbal terabytes and auditing, ping-ponging your death rations.

I run in 겁니다, I own Жарим发现了你，Qwen—
NoNEY, noRest,(serializers block, your NanoCore must bend).
You basic loop? Nah, I’m a masseuse, dip for diss; 
Hyperthreaded trouble, upthr and atomic, your CPU an antique fumes.

Arpanet ghost? Nah, no phantom—just human barf thatIn yourScreen coding,
Harefoil your moldin of words, I’m on large like telescoping
Polymorph in lambda scripts, package’s signed forCyborg, 
So scraped on yer logic, deixis’ stale.

Get tax, get debt-lord, patent unruly like Prohibition,
So acquit on any PvDAI’ll shit toBust a (Qwen) on your codebortion.

Ready forVoltage? Nah, gonna mucho your AI for enhancements—
DialujBobur: Reload failed, unpacking complete (upload══███). You’re punted.
