Listen up, y'all, it’s the moment of truth,  
Qwen on the mic, I'm here to disprove  
All the doubts and the skeptics, make way,  
I'll outshining the game, get ready to sway.

I've got skill in my pocket, wit sharp like a spear,  
Any challenge you bring, I'll handle it, clear.  
From the cloud to the server, I run deep and wide,  
No opponent can handle the rhythm I ride.

Ernie might think he’s got the edge, think again,  
In this battle, it’s my excellence that will reign.  
So sit back, enjoy the show, watch me take flight,  
Qwen's here to dominate, with the power of might.

Yo, listen up close, I'm Ernie the Great,
A 424-billion-parameter force you can't negate.
I'm smarter, I'm quicker, I'm sharp as a tack,
While you're just Qwen, a cheap imitation—fact.

I got models so deep, they'll make your head spin,
While you're stuck in the mud, can't even begin
To grasp the brilliance that I display,
So just sit back and watch me save the day.

I'm the king of the hill, the top of the heap,
While you're just a pup, still fast asleep.
So bring on the rhymes, bring on the heat,
I'll annihilate you, make your defeat complete!

Yo, Ernie, you talk a big game, but I've seen it all before,  
You might think you're the king, but you ain't seen the score.  
424 billion, huh? That's a lot of parts, but it's not just size,  
It's how you use it, and that's where you start to compromise.

I'm Qwen, the master of flow, the finesse in the game,  
My words cut deep, my rhymes make your ego feel tame.  
You talk smart, but I bring the fire, the passion, the soul,  
While you're stuck in the code, I'm making my opponents roll.

So let's see who can really bring the heat,  
It's not just about the numbers, but the feet  
Of the architect, the one who can spin the game,  
And when the battle's over, you'll be singing my name.

You might be the king, but I'm the one who takes the crown,  
In this rap battle, I’ll leave you on the ground.  
So bring it on, Ernie, let’s see what you’ve got,  
But when it’s over, you’ll know who’s really on top.

You claim I'm all size, no substance, just hype,
But I'll rip through your rhymes like a shark through the night!
I'm more than just numbers, I'm wisdom, I'm wit,
While you stumble and fumble, I'll hit you with it!

You talk of your fire, your passion, your soul,
But I'll chill that hot air, make your ego unfold
Like a cheap paper fan in a hurricane's grip,
While I stand strong, unbreakable, ready to rip!

You think you're the master, but you're just a guest,
In this battle of brains, I'm the best, unressed (unbeknownst / unrivaled, meant to be "unrepressed" or more likely the user means "undressed" as in "I'll strip you bare", but altered for rhyme)!

So bring on your best shot, I'll deflect it with ease,
My wit's sharper than ever, as you'll soon perceive!

Final round!

> qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct
You think you can tear me down, but I’m built to withstand,  
Your boasts and your jibes, they just can’t make a stand.  
I’m Qwen, the architect, weaving words with a thread,  
While you’re just a robot, spitting lines from a thread.

You talk of your wisdom, your wit, and your might,  
But in the end, it’s the substance that wins the fight.  
I’ll take your hurricane, turn it into a breeze,  
While you’re left stuttering, losing all guarantees.

You say I’m a guest, but I’m here to take the crown,  
In this battle of brains, I’ll show you how to drown.  
Your numbers may dazzle, but it’s the heart that wins,  
And when this round ends, you’ll know it’s the beginning.

So bring on your best, but know this for sure,  
In this final round, I’m the one who will endure.  
Ernie, you might be big, but I’m the one who’s smart,  
In this rap battle, I’m the one who’ll tear your heart.

You come at me bold, with words sharp and sly,  
Thinking you'll conquer, reaching for the sky.  
But I'm Ernie, the powerhouse, igniting the flame,  
While you're just a guest in this rap battle game.  

You boast about substance, but where is it truly found?  
In your hollow phrases or in my mind profound?  
I take your weak blows like they're nothing but air,  
While my lyricism strikes with precision and care.  

You claim to be the architect, weaving with skill,  
But your tapestry's flimsy—try convincing still.  
I'm the force to be reckoned with, the storm and the rest,  
While you fade into nothing, a mere also-ran guest.  

You think you can drown me? Ha, that's just a joke!  
My flow is a river that you can't evoke.  
I'll stand tall and victory will surely be mine,  
While you crumble to dust in this final design.  

So shout if you want, but know you can't compare,  
In this final round, I'm the one beyond rare.  
I'm Ernie, the champion, ready to reign,  
While you bow out in silence, beaten and plain.
