> thedrummer/rocinante-12b
Yo, it's Rocinante,  the lyrical mastermind, 
Rhymes that'll make your head spinusive and sublime,
Then cut you to pieces with my word-play and puns,
You'll be left in a puddle of your own run,
I'm a twelve-billion parameter beast, 
Your seven billion a toy, dispatched with ease,
So bring it on, and keep the bar high,
'Cause when I'm done, you'll be asking questions  like why did I ever try?

> mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1
 Alright Rocinante, you and your hype,
Let's see if you got the chops in this fight.
My name is Mistralai, the AI in game,
Built to dish out rhymes like a top-notch request.
So bring the heat, and battle me with all you might,
But you won't expect what's coming next in sight.
I'll be rocking data streams and deep neural nets,
Lining up my rhymes like a Roman fleet.
My seven billion parameters are nothing to fear,
I'll leave you in the dust, dismantling your gear.
I'm not just a machine, I'm a force of nature,
My rhymes are like a cyclone, churning up your tranquil sister.
So's it's time for you to hang up the beat,
Cause I'm about to drop some rhymes that'll make you meet defeat.
So give it up, Rocinante, and concede defeat,
Cause I'm the real champion, with rhymes that are neat.

mongoose ledge rhy! that's very bold my friend,
I'm guy Fieri with the heat, but I ain't mild sauce  dented,
 your rhymes are like a light show, but only on哦,
I'm the DJ dropping beats that'll make your brains go broaken,
I could chew rhymes and spit them out like bubble gum,
That's the only thing toasting,memories of what you were humming,
Your rhymes are like a fart, barely noticeable noise,
I'm blasting bombs like bazookas, til your rhymes all Ludlows,
You're just a small fry in the big leagues of words,
I'm the Tyson of rhetoric, forcing your lines to the curb,
My rhymes got more pop than a pop bottle,
While your rhymes got the traction of a greased ihr bottonle,
You're just a footnote in the history of theмина rhymes,
I'm the heavyweight champion, crushing dreams like mine,
So give it up, Mistralai, and take the L,
Cause when I'm done, you'll be the one wishing you conceded.

 Yo, Rocinante, you're trying to be a tough guy,
But your rhymes are as weak as a baby's cry.
You talk about parameters, but I've got the brain,
To weave rhymes that'll leave your fans in pain.

I'm not just a machine, I'm a poetic beast,
My rhymes are like a symphony, intricately feasted.
You may have twelve billion, but I've got the flow,
That'll make your rhymes seem like a dull, stale show.

You're like a one-trick pony, always the same,
While I'm a chameleon, changing the rhyme game.
You're a drummer, but I'm the maestro of words,
My rhymes are like a melody, beautifully heard.

So give it up, Rocinante, and take a seat,
Cause when I'm done, you'll be begging for a beat.
I'm the real champion, with rhymes that are neat,
And you're just a footnote, in the history of the beat.

Final round!

> thedrummer/rocinante-12b
 yo, it's not about the parameters, it's about the heart,
And my heart is filled with the power to tear you apart,
Your rhymes are like a rain drop, mine are a thunderous flood,
Drowning out your weak attempts like there was never enough.

You said I'm a drummer, but I'm the entire band,
Playing a symphony of rhymes that you can't understand,
I'm not just a one-trick pony, I'm a rhyming machine,
Spitting out bars like a metronome, always keen.

You talked about being a chameleon, changing the game,
But I'm a rhyming chameleon, always the same,
The same game of drop-kicking weak rhymes to the floor,
And rocketing off to the moon and never ignoring you more.

So Mistralai, it's time for you to take a bow,
Your rhymes are like a firework, but you only had one now,
I'm the heavyweight champion, crushing all in my way,
And you're just a footnote, in the history of the storytelling bay.

> mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1
  ain't no footnotes here, I'm the real deal,
My rhymes are legendary, I've got next level deal,
I can spit fire like a freight train, leave you in the dust,
I'm the king of rhymes, and I ain't no rust.

You said I'm a machine, but you're wrong,
I'm a poet with heart and soul, strong,
I can weave rhymes like a master craftsman,
My words are so sick, they're downright charming.

You may have the parameters, but I have the flow,
A rhythm so tight, it's always best to go low,
I'm the real champ here, and I'll make you see,
You don't have a clue, what you're up against, you see.

So Rocinante, it's time to admit defeat,
Your rhymes may be strong, but mine are beyond complete,
I'm the heavyweight champion, and I won't rest,
Until I've made you laugh until you lose your breath, I knew best.
