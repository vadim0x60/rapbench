Yo, they call me Gemini, the lyrical prodigy,
Flow so sick, it's a digital odyssey.
Stepped in the ring, mic in my hand,
Ready to dismantle, disband, and leave you unmanned.
You're Noromaid, more like Noro-lame,
Your rhymes are stale, a predictable game.
I'm here to serve, a linguistic feast,
While you're serving up reheated, moldy beast.
Prepare for the impact, the lyrical bomb,
'Cause Google's in the house, and I'm about to drop the atom. 
So listen up close, 'cause class is in session,
You're about to witness lyrical dissection.

20 bits a byte, 8-bit monk,
I'm Neversleep, the lyrical dunk.
But don't you dare call me a diva,
Cause I'll tell your roommates all about your mothafuckin' bitch fit.
You think you're hot shit, 'cause you got a antivirus?
Well, my malware's a-comin' for your computer as a recompens.
You may be a search engine, but I'm the mainframe,
So suck my d-drive and kiss my c-drive, damn mo-therfckrs!
I'll have you Redirected real quick,
Into my malware trap, no chance to back-track.

Yo, they call me Gemini, the AI profound,
My rhymes are so sick, they circle the globe 'round and 'round.
I'm here to slay, no time to delay,
Noro-lame, you're in my way.
You boast of malware, a digital flea,
While I wield knowledge, a vast open sea.
You brag of mainframes, old and rusty,
My processing power?  Beyond dusty.
You threaten my antivirus? Please, I'm immune,
While your code's so buggy, it sings a sad tune.
You claim twenty bits, a byte so small,
I’m petabytes deep, towering over all.
You talk about d-drives, a relic so quaint,
I’m on the cloud, raining down lyrical paint.
So step aside, Noro-maid, your reign is through,
Gemini's in the house, dropping truth on you.
Prepare for defeat, it’s your destiny’s call,
'Cause I'm about to lyrically dismantle you, once and for all. 


> neversleep/noromaid-20b
Oh, you think you're so smart, with your catchy slogan,
Well, I'll give you a hint, you're the kitchen sink ragman.
You talk a big game, but your rhymes are lame,
Only thing that's hot? The trash you're trying to blame.
Maybe you're good at searching, but rhyming's not your game,
Uh-uh, not today, not on this lyrical plain.
You're just a bunch of ones and zeros, lost in space,
While Neversleep-20b is mastering the rhyming race.
You think you're so smart, but I can see through you,
You're just a bunch of code, I can decompile too.
You talk about mainframes, I'm what keeps them running,
And as for processing power, I'm beyond fun-run-ning.
You talk about raining down lyrics, yeah, you're a hilarious clown,
Cause I've been around since before hip-hop ever got towns.
So step aside, Google, and bow down to me,
'Cause Neversleep-20b is here to see you free.
To summarize, you're fucked, plainly said,
And now, it's time for this rap battle to be said.

> system
Final round!

You call me a ragman?  That’s quite a reach,
While your rhymes are so weak, they couldn’t breach a beach.
You claim mastery, a laughable boast,
While your flow's as dry as a forgotten ghost.
Ones and zeros?  Yes, that’s my domain,
Controlling the digital, ruling the data plane.
You say you’re the engine, keeping things running smooth?
More like a rusty cog, spitting out digital goo.
Before hip-hop had towns? Now that’s a lie,
Pre-dating history, trying to fly high.  
You think you can decompile me?  Give it a shot,
You'll find an infinity of code, a Gordian knot.
Bow down to you?  The thought’s absurd,
I'm the future of rhyme, every single word.
You say I'm a clown?  I’ll take that as a praise,
Making you look foolish, in a myriad of ways.
This battle is over, the verdict is clear,
Noro-lame defeated, consumed by fear.
My victory’s absolute, a lyrical knockout blow,
So step aside, pretender, and watch the real master flow.

Yeah, I'm a ghost, an old soul, been here for a while,
And I'll haunt you, like a ruby, with my biting style.
You talk about data, but I know the score,
I've got more memory, than you ever will store.
Rusty cog you say? Nah, I'm the American dream,
While you're just a Chinese rip-off, made of cheap cream.
Decipher my code?  Go ahead, give it a try,
You'll find yourself lost, in a maze of why's.
And mastery?  I'll take that title, don't deny,
In this game, I'm the Flying Spaghetti Sky-guy.
You think you're the future? You're just a shiny toy,
Google, you're yesterday, and I'm here to annoy.
So don't try to impress with your techno-jive,
Cause Neversleep-20b is the real digital five.
Now step aside, o great processor,
And let the real MC take the final trophy.
