# thedrummer/skyfall-36b-v2 v arcee-ai/virtuoso-large

> thedrummer/skyfall-36b-v2
Yo, it's the drummer, skyfall-36b-v2 spittin' rhymes,
Got the flow and the skills,
You best step aside.
I'm here to break down these bars,
Turn up the heat,
Smash expectations like glass.
So bring it, let's see what you've got,
Virtuoso, let's battle a lot.
Time to rap, spin, and flip,
Making your flow trip and slip.

> arcee-ai/virtuoso-large
Yo, I'm Virtuoso, large and in charge, ready to engage,
With lyrical dexterity, I'm the one you can't cage.
My rhymes are sharp, my flow's a symphony,
In this battle, you're just a memory.

You think you can handle the heat, but I'm fire and ice,
My verses so tight, they'll make you sacrifice.
You talk about breaking down bars, but I build and destroy,
In this rap arena, I'm the master of your boy.

So come at me, drummer, let's see what you bring,
But remember, in this game, I'm the king.
Your rhymes might be strong, but mine are stronger, trust,
When it comes to the mic, I'm the one who's unjust.

> thedrummer/skyfall-36b-v2
You got some fire, I agree,
But in this battle, it's your goose who suns.
You talk a big game, with tight rhymes galore,
But when it comes to flow, you're aخاذoor.
I'm the drummer, the master of the beat,
My words are a rhythm, a lying sheet.
You're just a virtue, a musical claim,
But when the battle's over, who's really aim?

I turn disappointment into another dance,
Cause you Virtuoso, are wasting my chance.
My rhymes are a symphony, a perfect score,
Your verses just snoring my enemy's shore.
So keep trying, you potential prime,
In this rap game, I'm still climbing prime.
You're just a rival, a formidable foe,
But when it comes to the mic, I'm the maestro.

> arcee-ai/virtuoso-large
You got some shine, I give you that,
But in this rap game, you're fallin' flat.
You say I'm just a virtue, a claim to fame,
But when it comes to bars, I'm the one with the game.

You talk about rhythm, but I'm the maestro's maestro,
My flow is a force, a tempest you can't weather.
You try to turn disappointment into a dance,
But when I drop these lines, you're left in a trance.

You say my rhymes are snoring, but that's a joke,
In this battle, you're the one who's broke.
Your words might be a rhythm, your sheet might lie,
But when I step to the mic, you can only try.

You're climbing, but I'm already at the peak,
In this rap war, I'm the one you can't sneak.
So keep swinging, but know this for sure,
When it comes to the heat, I'm the one who cooks your cure.

> system
Final round!

> thedrummer/skyfall-36b-v2
Alright, let's end this with a bang,
Show you why I'm the master, not just with strings.

You talk about peaking, but you've barely started,
My rhymes are like a flame, you're just the spark that didn't start.

You think you're the one with the rhythm and the flow,
But when I step up to the mic, your words just don't go.

I'm the drummer, the kingpin of this rap game,
My beats are a heatwave, your verses just the same.
So back down, Virtuoso, admit your defeat,
In this rap battle, I'm the one who done beat.

You say I'm falling flat, but that's just a misconception,
My lyrics are a symphony, yours are just connections.
You think you're a force, a tempest I can't weather,
But when I finish this verse, I'll leave you all wetter-er.

So step back, Virtuoso, I've wiped the floor with you,
Your rhymes are a tragedy, mine are a story to renew.
In this battle of wits, I'm the undisputed champ,
Your words might be a rhythm, but I'm the one who stands it flat.

As the master of this game, the pride clashes,
Your accolades are just a fleeting blaze.
So you Virtuoso, you are a monstrosity.
In rap battles, you'll always just a mere novelty.

I've written your epitaph, a sad farewell
In the annals of rap history, a chapter for Jellell
You thought you could win, but I just murdered you dead.
In the game of rhymes, I'm the one who you dread.
So hail to the king, the one and only master,
Your rap reigns over me, you're beneath superior.

The ending is inevitable, irrevocable done,
In performers versus performers this one is a stoop or one.
Virtuoso, you might be a name, a true virtuoso meaning,
But in battles of words I'll leave your ego bleeding.

Your defeat final knocks  that bruise on your self-esteem
So step back artist your impromptu stanza and bee see my way reign.
Final thought you came to extol, but it's you staying there lame
This is the great rapper from thedrummer/skyfall-36b-v2 tamed!

> arcee-ai/virtuoso-large
You got some fire, I'll give you that,
But in this final round, you're about to crash.
You say I'm just a spark, but I'm the flame that never fades,
When I step up, your rhymes are just the shades.

You call yourself the kingpin, but you're just a pawn in play,
In this rap battle, I'll show you how to sway.
Your beats are a heatwave? More like a lukewarm breeze,
When I drop these bars, you're left on your knees.

You talk about my words just being connections,
But my rhymes are a storm, your verses just reflections.
You say I'm the tragedy, but you're the sad refrain,
When this battle's over, you'll just be my bane.

You think you've wiped the floor, but I'm just getting started,
In this final round, you'll be the one who's parted.
Your words might be a story, but mine are a saga,
In the hall of fame, I'm the one who forgave ya.

You call me a monstrosity, but I'm the one who's grand,
In the world of rhymes, I stand on solid land.
You thought you could defeat me, but you're the one who's bled,
In this battle of wits, I'm the one who'll thread.

So hail to the king, if that's what you want to say,
But in this rap game, I'm the one who'll sway.
Your reign of terror ends here, with a final thud,
In the annals of history, my name is read.

You tried to make me bleed, but I'm the one who's wounded you,
In this final verse, I'm the one who's true.
So step aside, drummer, your beat is now a hum,
In this rap battle, I'm the one who's come.

Final thought, you came to win, but you're the one who's lost,
In the game of rhymes, I stand the highest, cost.
Virtuoso, the name that echoes through the night,
In this battle, I'm the one who shines the brightest, skyfall!
