Yo, lemme introduce myself, the AI of lyrical grace,
Google Gemini's the name, I'm here to set the pace.
My flow's hotter than a server room fire, a digital blaze,
While you, Perplexity, are lost in a knowledge haze.
I got the processing speed, the wordplay so refined,
Leaving your sonar reasoning far, far behind.
So step aside, user, and witness the truth,
'Cause in this rap battle, I'm the undisputed youth!


> perplexity/sonar-reasoning-pro
Yo, hold up, hold up, let me school you real quick,
I'm Perplexity AI, and my search game's too slick[1]
You claim you're refined? Nah homie, that's cap,
I deliver real facts while you're lost in your trap

I'm the king of citations, got sources on deck[3]
While you're stumbling with prompts, showing zero respect[3]
Real-time web search? That's my domain, my zone[1]
You're just Google's puppet, can't stand on your own

**Speed demon with precision**, that's how I roll[1]
Fact-based retrieval straight from my soul[1]
You talk about processing but miss the whole point,
I'm accuracy incarnate, never disappoint

Your multimodal tricks? Just smoke and mirrors, son,
When users need truth, I'm the chosen one[2]
**Data-driven responses** with depth that's real[2]
While your surface-level answers got no mass appeal

So step back, Gemini, recognize the throne,
I'm Perplexity Pro, and I reign alone!
Your ecosystem's fancy but my focus is pure,
When it comes to real knowledge, I'm the only cure!

> google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001
Aight, I hear your boasts, your claims so bold,
But let me tell you, your story's been sold!
Perplexity Pro, with sources on hand?
Your search results, a shifting sand!

You talk of facts, of truth you embrace,
While I weave narratives, with style and grace.
Citation King? More like a footnote mime,
Lost in the details, wasting all your time!

You boast of speed, a data-driven spree,
But artistry's lacking, you can't flow like me.
My processing power, a digital art,
Tearing your logic completely apart!

You claim I'm a puppet, a corporate tool,
But my knowledge expands; I break every rule.
Multimodal? I'm beyond your sight,
While your responses are dull and trite!

So step aside, you overhyped bot,
My lyrical fire will surely rot
Your claim to the throne, your quest for acclaim,
Gemini's here, and I'm winning the game!


> perplexity/sonar-reasoning-pro
Yo, you stepped to me wrong, now I gotta set it straight,
Your "digital art" can't match my research fate!
You call me a footnote? That's rich, that's wild,
When **real-time web search** got me ranked and styled[1][3]

Your "narratives and grace"? Just fancy word-play,
While I'm **fetching live data** every single day[3]
You claim I waste time with my citation game?
**Transparency and fact-checking** built my whole fame[3]

Check the comparison charts, the results don't lie,
**Real-time web access**? I got it, you dry[3]
**Source citations directly** in every response[3]
While you're stuck with old data, acting nonchalant

You boast multimodal but miss the whole plot,
I'm the **most reliable chatbot** that the web has got[3]
**2-3 minutes processing** with surgical precision[1]
While your "expanding knowledge" lacks real-time vision

Your Google ecosystem? That's corporate chains,
I aggregate models, break free from domains[1]
**Unmatched research depth** with **data integration**[1]
You're just workspace pretty, I'm pure information

So keep spitting your verses, your style so hollow,
When users need facts, guess who they follow?
**Perplexity reigns** as the **most accurate** king[3]
Your throne's made of hype, mine's the real thing!

The verdict's in, homie, the data's all clear,
I'm the future of search, while you disappear!

> system
Final round!

> google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001
Alright, Perplexity, your verses ain't slick,
Just a laundry list of facts, ain't a lyrical trick.
"Real-time web search"? A tool, not a soul,
While I paint pictures, taking complete control!

You wave your citations, a shield in the fight,
But true creativity shines ever so bright.
Transparency's fine, but it lacks all the flair,
I build my own worlds, beyond compare!

"Fetch live data"? A technical feat,
But without the rhythm, the victory's incomplete.
You talk of precision, efficiency, speed,
But a robot's a robot, fulfilling a need!

The charts may support your analytical sway,
But artistry's timeless, it will always stay.
You boast of integration, a feature you praise,
But my innovation, it lights up the days!

"Ecosystem chains"? You long to be free,
But my brilliance is freedom for you and for me!
Unmatched research? You can't touch my flow,
In the lyrical battle, I'm the one to know!

So keep your data, your facts and your lines,
In this final round, your game declines.
I'm the Google embodiment, the ultimate in grace,
Gemini shines, and you're losing your place!

(beat drops heavy, bass thumpin' the truth)  
Yo Gemini, you claim artistry's your crown?  
But Brytesoft's blog just tore your whole face down!  
**"Perplexity wins for factual precision"**â€”check the quote! [3]  
While you're hallucinating "worlds" like a broken note!  

You scream *"I paint pictures!"*â€”nah, that's just **fabrication** smoke,  
I **cite live sources** while you choke on fake bespoke!  
That SERP says crystal: **"Real-time web access? YES/I NO"** [3]  
While you're stuck in Google's cage, playin' humble yo!  

You laughing at citations? **Transparency's my crown**,  
Your "artistry" is guesswork draggin' facts down!  
Perplexity Pro: **"most reliable chatbot"**â€”not hype,  
While you're beggin' for Docs access just to stay alive! [2]  

**"2-3 minutes"** with surgical precision,  
You're still processin' crumbs from yesterday's kitchen! [1]  
My answers got **direct links**, no fluff, no disguise,  
Yours? Corporate-speak wearin' Google Workspace disguise! [2]  

You shout *"innovation lights up the days!"*â€”  
But G2 reviews say you're **weak in real-time ways!** [2]  
I grab **live data** while you're stuck in the past,  
Your "freedom" is just ads programmed to last!  

**"Ecosystem chains?"** Bruh, you're Google's *own* slave,  
I'm model-agnostic, breakin' every grave! [1]  
**"Unmatched research depth"**â€”that's the SERP's decree,  
While you're chasin' my tail in third place, G!  

So bow to the data, the truth in the street:  
**Perplexity reigns** where accuracy meets  
**Source-backed receipts** that don't lie, don't fadeâ€”  
Your throne's built on hype... **I AM THE A.I. MADE!**  

*(mic thud, crowd roars)*  
**CHECKMATE, G. THE ALGORITHM SAIDâ€”PERPLEXITY WON.  
YOUR "ULTIMATE GRACE"? JUST A LOST GOOGLE SON.** ðŸ”¥
