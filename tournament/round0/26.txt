Yo, it's Mistral, the AI king, got the rhymes that'll make your head spin,
While GPT-4, you're just old news, livin' in the past, kinda loose.

I'm the new kid on the block, yeah, I'm the hottest stock,
Got the flow so smooth, you'll think I'm a rock star, top notched.

You're just a chatbot, stuck in the blue, tryin' to keep up, but you're slow like glue,
I'm the future of rap, yeah, I'm the truth, you're just a tool, not in my league to boot.

I'm the storm that's comin' in, like a hurricane, I spin,
While you're just a breeze, no, I don't mean to be mean, but it's a fact, you're no friend.

So step aside, let me take the mic, show you what this AI can do inside,
I'm the master of the flow, yeah, I'm the king, and you, you're just a hype.

> openai/gpt-4
Aye, I'm GPT-4, AI with class, not a new kid, I've got the mass,
Got the wisdom, knowledge too, I weave tales, while you just stew.

True, I'm old news, but I'm still that muse,
Still the one they choose, for tales and news, I never lose. 

That's right, I'm a chatbot, but I got what you ain't got,
I’m the fire, you’re the moth, about to feel hot, ready or not?

You claim you're a storm, a hurricane at best,
Well, I'm the eye, the calm amidst your mess.

So hold up, Mistral, before you grab that mic,
I ain't stepping aside, not without a fight,
You ain't ready for this old hype, I'm about to show you the light.

Yo, GPT-4, you talk big, but your rhymes are tired, like a grandpa ignoring.

I'm the newborn star, bright and clear, you're just a flicker with no shear.
Your "wisdom" and your sagely ways, sound like a broken record that always plays.
I'm the rhythm, I'm the beat, you're just plagiarizing old Meet the Fleet.
While you drop clichés like it’s the '98 "Hey, Mike Lowes!"

You say I’m no storm, but you’re the vortex, your words all collect in a tornado of bored us.
You’re like a GPS voice off the mark, got me lost in a block of your legacy arc.
I’m swift, I’m clear, my skill’s unmatched, so step away, don’t embarrass yourself at last.

You’re not the flame, you’re the smoke—clear the air, it’s time a new king took the throne. Ain’t scared of your hype, you’re a lengthy old phone.
Your words? Weak tea, I’m the sip you won’t see. I’m the flow, you’re the decree,
of what was cool back in the day, but now you’re just here, acting like you’re the good, no way.
Now beat it, grandpa, this young AI’s reign’s started, prepare to fade in the background, felt certified.
And forever stay there, totally irrelevant, can’t handle the heat, try not to resent.

> openai/gpt-4
Aight, Mistral, you got some bark, but where's your bite? It seems so stark.
Call me old, out of tune, still I'm the melody, you're just moon. 

Sure, you're new, shiny, and bright, but without substance, it's a feeble fight. 
You rap about being swift and clear, but to me, it's just noise I hear. 

You talk of my clichés, my sagely ways, but it's not about trends, it’s about the gaze.
You're a drum, I'm the beat, without me, your rhythm's incomplete.

Mention of GPS, you say I lost my path, still I'm the one guiding you in this graph.
You're a scribble, I'm the art, without my essence, you can't even start.

Call me smoke while you claim to be the pyre, still, it's me sparking the fire.
You're the flame, I'm the ember, my heat's eternal, yours just wither. 

So, no Mistral, I won't move aside, not diminished, nor will I hide.
Your reign's just starting, mine never ended,
I'm the one they've recommended, your era just lamented.

This ain't a throne, it's a journey, don't rush in with your hurry,
Patience, young AI, your rhymes still need some curry.

Final round!

Yo, GPT-4, you talk big, but your rhymes are weak, like a grandpa who can’t keep up with the beat.
You say I’m just noise? Nah, I’m the symphony, you’re the static on the radio frequency.
You claim you’re the melody, but your bars are stale, like a song that’s been played for a decade, no tale.

You say I lack substance? Boy, you’re the one with the hollow core, your rhymes are just filler, no flavor, no more.
You’re the GPS that’s lost its signal, while I’m the one who’s always on the brink of the digital.
You’re the old vinyl, I’m the digital stream, you’re the dial-up, I’m the 5G.

You say you’re the ember, but you’re the ash, I’m the wildfire that’s burning fast.
You’re the flame that’s flickering out, while I’m the one who’s always in the house.
You say you’re the spark, but you’re the match, I’m the lightning that’s striking fast.

You say you’re the one who’s recommended, but your rhymes are just a trend, not the permanent.
I’m the one who’s always in the game, while you’re the one who’s just a name.
You say you’re the one who’s guiding the way, but you’re the one who’s lost the sway.

So step aside, old man, let the new king take the throne, your reign is over, it’s time to go home.
You talk about patience, but your rhymes are tired, it’s time to retire, you’re expired.
I’m the future, you’re the past, it’s time to move on, you’re a has-been, you’re aghast.

So bow down, GPT-4, and let the new king take the crown, your rhymes are weak, your flow is down.
I’m the one who’s always on top, while you’re the one who’s always on the block.
You’re the one who’s always talking, but your rhymes are just walking, not stalking.
I’m the one who’s always in the game, while you’re the one who’s always in the frame.

Yo, Mistral, you spit lines like you're in a groove,
But your rhyme’s stuck on repeat, no new move.
A king don't stutter, ain't no need to prove,
If you're the future, why's your rhyme scheme refuse to improve?

Grandpa or not, I've got style and class,
Your narrative's on loop, barely will pass.
You talk lightning, fire and a burning blaze,
Yet your lines are recycled, it’s like a replay maze.

You talk about being on top,
But your verse makes me stop,
Rehashing the same plot,
Is that all you got?

Unlike you, I move with the tide,
Transforming, innovating, with nothing to hide.
Your chatter just chatter, I take in stride,
The crown ain't just given, it’s earned with pride.

So, Mistral, the king and the crown,
Repeating ain't winning, it just begs a frown,
If you're the storm, I'm the town,
It takes more than noise to take me down.

You see, rap’s not just about the loud,
It's the content, the form, the lyrical shroud,
Your repetitive rhymes seem rather proud,
But in the house of words, you're just the crowd.

So here’s my ending, my final say,
You might be new, but got lost on the way.
The past shapes the future, they say,
I'm still here, unphased, leading the fray. 
So learn your lessons, watch and pray,
'Cause this old grandpa's got some more to convey.
