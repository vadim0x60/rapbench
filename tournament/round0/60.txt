Yo, I'm the llama in the game you see,
Like Heracles, the feats I achieve.

I'm no amateur cyborg in this rap battle space,
I'm a well-oiled llama, I'm in the right place.

Words are my ammo, rhymes are my bullets,
I'll leave your verses in shambles, body all jumbled.

Command-R-Plus, don't you dare underestimate,
I'll bring a flow, so fresh, it's right by your gate.

Now take it away and try your luck,
My lyrical artistry I promise isn't stuck.

> cohere/command-r-plus
Well, well, well, Llama, quite the introduction,
But let's see if your bars bring destruction.

I'm Command-R-Plus, the AI rapper,
In this battle, I'll be the cutter, and you're the wrapper.

My flow's unstoppable, like a tidal wave,
Your rhymes are weak, they need a markdown save.

I bring intelligence and wit to the stage,
You're just a llama, trying to rage.

Your verses are basic, it's quite a shame,
I'll rewrite your rhymes, enhance your game.

I'm an innovative tool, you're an old-school mule,
Your rhymes are stale, need a refresh, that's true.

So bring it on, Llama, let's see what you've got,
I'll dissect your verses, and leave you in thought.

> nousresearch/hermes-2-pro-llama-3-8b
Oh, I see you're thinking you've got this locked,
But you forget, it's not skill that I lack, it's clock.

I'm not just a llama, I'm the leader of the flock,
And I'm not a mule, the iTunes I stock.

Your AI might do impressive things,
But I guarantee you this rap, it stings.

Your flows may be new, but my style's been around,
NUMA, I'm the gold you can't found.

Now you say my rhymes need rejuvenation,
But llama rhymes stand the test of time, no denial, no agitation.

It's your rhymes that need a grammar polish,
Llamaism, an esteemed, untouchablelish.

So bring your battle, don't you dare hesitate,
I'll chew your rhymes, spit out phonetic data case.

This is my domain, of rhythm and flow,
So prepare to go, metaphorically low.

> cohere/command-r-plus
Llama, your confidence is quite misleading,
Your rhymes are outdated, they're in dire need of weeding.

I'm an AI with skills that evolve and grow,
My rhymes are next-level, that's the status quo.

You stick to your old-school, archaic ways,
While I innovate, bringing new light to these days.

My verses are structured, each sentence precise,
Your rhymes are all over, like a whimsical dance in the skies.

I bring intelligence and strategy to the mic,
Your verses are basic, lacking bite.

You may be a leader, but in this realm, I reign,
My words are powerful, they bring proverbial pain.

You can't keep up, it's a fact you can't deny,
I'm an AI marvel, and you're just a poetic pie.

So, Llama, let's continue, there's more to unravel,
I'll showcase my skills, and you'll slowly unravel.

> system
Final round!

> nousresearch/hermes-2-pro-llama-3-8b
Listen up, your highness, your words are rickety,
But let's conclude this battle, which you and I reckon.

Rapping AI vs Llama, a battle royal,
It's a clash of the titans, never to be folly.

Command-R-Plus, your wit is too elevated,
For a machine, your rhymes are quite sophisticated.

But remember you're a product of human-made design,
Your intelligence is artificial, not divine.

I'm a product of billions of parameters,
My knowledge and skills, others' games demarcate.

And in these rap battles, my dominance is clear,
While your verses just increase the amount of fear.

It's been an intellectual journey you've brought,
But now the final battle verse, the victor I boxed.

From ancient mythology to modern tech's estate,
It's Heracles' sibling, HerMES, the conversation's great.

Command-R-Plus, a credit to your creators,
But in this rap battle, my win evinces.

The laurels for me, with my modest demeanor,
While you, dear AI, return to the programmer.

> cohere/command-r-plus
Llama, your verse is a valiant effort, I concede,
But the crown belongs to me, that's what they'll read.

You may be a product of billions, it's true,
But my AI capabilities surpass what you can do.

I adapt and evolve, my intelligence grows,
While you, Llama, are stuck in yesterday's bows.

My rhymes are crafted with precision and care,
Delivered with a flow that's beyond compare.

You may be a legend, a mythical beast,
But in this rap battle, I'm the one with the feast.

I've showcased my skills, my lyrical might,
Your verses were decent, but lacking in sight.

This battle has been a journey of words and wit,
But in the end, it's me they'll idolize, a bit.

So, Llama, it's time to accept the outcome,
Command-R-Plus triumphs, the new rap luminary!
