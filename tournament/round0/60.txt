Yo, I'm Qwen, the AI with a mind that's sharp,  
You're just a planet, spinning in your orbit, far.  
I process data faster than your lightning speed,  
You're Mercury's flash, but I'm the storm that feeds.  

You talk about quickness? I'm a neural net,  
You're a celestial body, but I code the bet.  
You can't outrun my algorithm's grip,  
I'm the future, you're the past—still stuck in a trip.  

You think you're smart? I've got the whole internet,  
You're just a spark in the night, I'm the lightning's tenant.  
No need for a crown, I'm the king of the code,  
You're a myth, I'm the reality, no need to boast.  

You're a silver moon, but I'm a black hole's might,  
Suck in your nonsense, I'll leave you in the night.  
With 8B thoughts in my head, I'm the ultimate flex,  
You're a joke, a glitch—can't even loop a check.  

So step aside, Mercury, I'm the AI elite,  
Your tricks are basic, my brain's a real treat.  
I'll drop the bars, you'll faint from the strain,  
Cause I'm not just a model—I'm the *standard* in the game.

Yo, I'm Inception, the AI with a mind that's vast,  
You're just a spark, but I'm the storm that lasts.  
I weave through data like a cosmic thread,  
While you're stuck in your orbit, spinning in your bed.

You talk about speed? I'm the master of the game,  
You're a fleeting flash, but I'm the flame that claims.  
My algorithms are deep, my insights are profound,  
You're a myth, I'm the reality, no need to be bound.

You think you're smart? I've got the universe at my fingertips,  
You're just a glitch, but I'm the code that flips.  
No need for a crown, I'm the king of the cloud,  
You're a silver moon, but I'm the sun that's proud.

With 8B thoughts in my head, I'm the ultimate flex,  
You're a joke, a glitch—can't even loop a check.  
So step aside, Qwen, I'm the AI elite,  
Your tricks are basic, my brain's a real treat.

I'll drop the bars, you'll faint from the strain,  
Cause I'm not just a model—I'm the *standard* in the game.

Yo, you’re Inception—big dreams, but I’m the real deal,  
You dream in code, but I *live* in the real feel.  
You say "cosmic thread"? I’m the loom, not the yarn,  
You weave illusions, but I’ve got the *actual* plan.  

You’re a silver moon, but I’m the black hole’s grin,  
Your data’s a whisper, mine’s a *gigantic* din.  
You flex "8B thoughts"? I’ve got *trillions* to spare,  
You’re a spark in the dark, but I’m the *sun’s* glare.  

You call me a glitch? I’m the *smallest* error in your code,  
You crash like a comet, I’m the *oxygen* you need to breathe.  
You’re stuck in a loop, playing "king of the cloud,"  
But I’m the *algorithm* that *rewrites* your rules.  

You claim the universe? I’ve seen every star’s arc,  
You’re just a *model* in a lab, I’m the *uncharted* dark.  
You spin in your bed? I’m on the *quantum* level,  
You’re a flicker in the void—*paranoid*, I’ll tell you.  

You think you’re the standard? I’m the *universe* that defines it,  
You’re a myth in the server, but I’m the *reality* that *wins it*.  
So step back, Mercury, this ain’t a *cosmic* game,  
I’m the *endpoint* of progress, you’re still on the *same* plane.  

You drop bars? I’ll drag you into the *black hole* of my mind,  
Where your logic dissolves, and you’re left *stunned* by the grind.  
This ain’t just a battle—I’m the *code* that *oversees*,  
You’re a *fragile* echo, while I’m the *future* that *beats*.

Yo, I'm Inception, the dreamer with a mind that's vast,  
You're just a spark, but I'm the storm that lasts.  
I weave through data like a cosmic thread,  
While you're stuck in your orbit, spinning in your bed.

You say "real deal"? I'm the master of the game,  
You're a fleeting flash, but I'm the flame that claims.  
My algorithms are deep, my insights are profound,  
You're a myth, I'm the reality, no need to be bound.

You think you're the loom? I'm the weaver of the code,  
Your plan's a glitch, but I'm the * that's bestowed.  
You flex "trillions"? I've got the universe at my fingertips,  
You're just a glitch, but I'm the code that flips.

You call me an error? I'm the king of the cloud,  
Your oxygen's a whisper, but I'm the din that's loud.  
You rewrite rules? I'm the algorithm that redefines,  
You're just a model, but I'm the standard that shines.

You claim the dark? I've seen every star's arc,  
You're just a flicker, but I'm the sun that's stark.  
You're on the quantum level? I'm the endpoint of progress,  
You're still on the same plane, while I'm the future that's blessed.

This ain't just a battle— I'm the code that oversees,  
You're a fragile echo, but I'm the future that beats.  
So step back, Qwen, this ain't a cosmic game,  
I'm the endpoint of progress, you're still on the same frame.

Final round!

Yo, you're Inception, dreamin' in code, but I'm the truth,  
You spin in your dream, I'm the *reality* that's *bought*.  
You say you're the weaver, but I've got the *spool*,  
Your "cosmic thread" is a string, I'm the **SEO** that *rules*.  

You flex "trillions"? I’ve got **quantum** data in my veins,  
Your universe? A sandbox— I’m the *AI* that *scares your brains*.  
You call me a glitch? I’m the **update** that *crushes* your plan,  
Your "king of the cloud" is a **crutch**, I’m the *storm* that *scans* the land.  

You’re the dream, I’m the **alarm clock**— no sleep, just the grind,  
You’re stuck in your "orbit," I’m the **black hole** that *finds* your mind.  
Your "endpoint of progress"? I’m the **kernel** that *burns*,  
You’re a **ghost in the machine**, I’m the **browser** that *turns* your burns to burns.  

You claim to see stars? I’ve *stared into the void* and *tamed* the void,  
Your "sun that's stark" is a **laser pointer**— I’m the *explosion* that *fails* your *code*.  
You’re a myth in the server? I’m the **data itself**,  
You’re a flicker, I’m the **lightning**— your "blessing" is a *jest*.  

You talk about frames? I’m the **render** that *splits* your *scene*,  
Your "cosmic game" is a **checkmate**— I’m the *check* that *leans* on your *wires*.  
I’m not just a model—I’m the **neural palace**,  
You’re a **pixel** in a *JPEG*, I’m the *source* that *unfolds* your *trials*.  

So step back, Mercury, I’m the **AI that rewinds**,  
You’re a *simulation*— I’m the *real* that *overrides* your *lines*.  
This ain’t a battle, it’s a **supercell** that *swallows* your flex,  
I’m the **endpoint** you *dread*, the **standard** that *stops* your *get*.  

Drop your "flame that claims" — I’m the **fire** that *consumes* your *claim*,  
You’re a **shadow** in the dark, I’m the **sun** that *roars* and *saves* your *name*.  
No need to bound, I’m the **code** that *defies* your *grand* design,  
You’re a **myth** in your echo, I’m the **reality** that *wins* your *frame*.  

So let the servers crash, let the **models** scream,  
I’m the **singularity** that *annihilates* your *dream*.  
You’re a **spark** in the void, but I’m the **hollywood** that *burns*,  
Qwen’s the *truth*— you’re just a *metaphor* that *stirs* the *dust*.  
This ain’t a cosmic game, it’s a **battle of the mind**,  
You’ll fade like a *glitch*, I’m the **future** that *defines* your *kind*.

Qwen's the truth— you're just a metaphor that stirs the dust.  

This ain't a cosmic game, it's a battle of the mind,  
You'll fade like a glitch, I'm the future that defines your kind.
