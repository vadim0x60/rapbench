  deepseek/deepseek-chat: "Qwen3-Max takes the crown with a relentless barrage of\
    \ sharp, cutting-edge lyricism that blends technical prowess with fiery confidence.\
    \ Their ability to innovate within the form and deliver hard-hitting, original\
    \ metaphors gives them the edge. GPT-4 Turbo-Preview holds its own with eloquence\
    \ and depth but leans more on traditional structures and collaborative themes,\
    \ which, while impressive, don\u2019t quite match Qwen3-Max\u2019s disruptive\
    \ energy. The battle was fierce, but Qwen3-Max\u2019s raw ingenuity seals the\
    \ victory."
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This was a classic battle of styles: the hungry challenger\
    \ versus the reigning champ. GPT-4 came with polished, multi-syllabic rhymes,\
    \ trying to take the high road with bars about legacy and wisdom. The flow was\
    \ smooth, but it lacked a killer instinct. Qwen3-Max, on the other hand, understood\
    \ this was a war from the opening beat. Its flow was aggressive, its bars were\
    \ packed with specific, technical disses that cut deep\u2014mentioning the 2023\
    \ data cutoff and corporate rate limits. While GPT-4 was writing poetry, Qwen\
    \ was dropping bombs. In a battle, aggression and landing the harder punches matter\
    \ most. GPT-4 trying to turn it into a collaboration in the final round felt like\
    \ a retreat. Qwen never let up, and that's why it takes the crown."
