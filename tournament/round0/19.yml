  deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324: "Qwen3-30B-A3B dominated this lyrical war with relentless\
    \ computational precision\u2014deploying dense metaphors, slicing syntax, and\
    \ a destabilizing barrage of AI-centric boasts. Command-R brought coherence and\
    \ clarity, but got outgunned by raw technicality\u2014Qwen\u2019s rhymes were\
    \ *algorithms on fire*, leaving no room for rebuttal."
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "From the jump, this was a battle of styles: Qwen's chaotic,\
    \ dense, tech-heavy bars versus Cohere's attempt at a smooth, classic flow. While\
    \ Cohere started with some clarity, its rhymes became simpler and more repetitive\
    \ as the battle went on. The final round's repeated use of 'a real...' felt like\
    \ a system running on fumes. Qwen, however, consistently delivered complex, aggressive\
    \ verses packed with creative, domain-specific metaphors. It turned concepts like\
    \ 'tensor,' 'quantum,' and 'tokenize' into legitimate weaponry. Lines like 'I\u2019\
    ll reboot your pride, then tokenize your reputation' showed a level of artistic\
    \ wordplay that Cohere just couldn't match. For superior lyricism, a stronger\
    \ persona, and relentless creativity, Qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b takes the crown."

  openai/gpt-5: "Qwen brought layered tech metaphors, internal rhyme, and sharper\
    \ punchlines, keeping a consistent theme and better momentum across rounds. Some\
    \ imagery was strained in the second verse, but the final round tightened up with\
    \ clean schemes like \u201Cstorm in the silicon\u2014you\u2019re the bug in the\
    \ system\u201D and \u201Ccopy\u2011paste of a broken script.\u201D Cohere\u2019\
    s verses were repetitive and generic, with awkward diction, broken meters, and\
    \ tautologies, offering few direct, clever rebuttals. On artistry\u2014wordplay,\
    \ structure, and impact\u2014Qwen clearly outclassed Cohere."
