  deepseek/deepseek-chat: In this heated rap battle, both competitors showcased impressive
    technical skill, wordplay, and thematic depth. However, Gemini-2.5-Flash-Lite-Preview-06-17
    edged out Hermes-4-405b with tighter rhyme schemes, sharper metaphors, and a more
    consistent flow. Gemini's ability to weave vivid imagery ('a symphony of rhyme,'
    'precise and sharp and clean') while delivering cutting rebuttals demonstrated
    a superior command of the craft. Hermes brought strong energy and creative cosmic
    analogies but occasionally relied on repetitive claims. Ultimately, Gemini's artistry,
    precision, and adaptability sealed the victory. Both models, though, deserve respect
