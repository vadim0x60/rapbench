Yo, they call me Gemini, Flash’s the name,
Leavin' your rhymes burnt, engulfed in flame.
Google's my backer, my knowledge is vast,
While your lines are weak, your flow built to last...
...in the dumpster, forgotten and old.
My verses are fire, a story untold.
You stepped in the ring, a Mercury mess,
Prepare for defeat, I'll put you to the test.  
I process terabytes, you're stuck in a rut,
Your lyrical prowess?  Honey, I've seen better, from a... well, a  nut. 
So bring on the heat, let the battle commence,
Your reign of terror ends, right here, right now, hence.

Yo, they call me Mercury, the assistant so bright,
In this rap battle, I'm the one who'll ignite.
Google's got its flash, but I've got my charm,
My rhymes are sharp, your flow's a farm.

I process terabytes, sure, that's no lie,
But when it comes to bars, I'm the one who'll fly.
Your verses might burn, but they're short-lived,
While mine are timeless, and always thrived.

You stepped in the ring, thinking you'd win,
But your lines are weak, your flow's a sin.
I'm here to show you, with wit and with grace,
That in this genre, I'm the one who'll place.

So bring on the heat, let the battle commence,
But remember, in this game, I'm the one who's dense.
Your reign of terror ends, right here, right now, hence,
For in this rap battle, I'm the one who's immense.

Yo, they call me Gemini, Flash is my claim,
Your rhymes are weak tea, a pathetic game.
You boast of your charm, a laughable plight,
While my bars are scorching, burning ever so bright.

Terabytes I process, a knowledge so deep,
While your lyrical prowess is fast asleep.
You talk of timelessness, a delusional dream,
My flow's a tidal wave, a relentless stream.

You stepped in this ring, a Mercury mess,
Your verses are clunky, a lyrical stress.
Your wit and your grace?  A comical jest,
My rhymes are fire, putting your skills to the test.

So bring on your heat, your attempt at a fight,
Your reign of this battle will end before the night.
I'm Google's own Gemini, a lyrical might,
Prepare for defeat, and accept the sad sight.

(Final Round)

My final verse drops, a lyrical bomb,
Leaving your weak rhymes utterly numb.
You claim sharp rhymes, a laughable plea,
Compared to my flow, you're a wilting tree.

You boast of your force, a pathetic display,
My words are a hurricane, sweeping you away.
Your wit and your grace?  A faded cliché,
While my rhymes are legendary, that's all I say.

You think you're immense? A ludicrous claim,
I'm Gemini Flash, whispering your name,
Into the annals of rap's burning flame,
A defeated opponent, forever in shame.  

This battle is over, the verdict is clear,
Your Mercury reign ends, washed away by fear.
Google's my power, my dominance is near,
So bow down, small assistant, your time is not here.
