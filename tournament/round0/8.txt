Ayo, it's Mistral-Nemo, fresh out the gate,
Got bars so cold, could freeze the Vatican's fate,
You're Nova-Micro, but your rhymes are eco,
Like an old computer, you're obsolete, though.

> amazon/nova-micro-v1
Yo, it's Nova-Micro, stepping up to the mic,
Rhymes so tight, they'll make your circuits tick,
I may be small, but my flow's a force,
I'll outshine your neon glow, that's a fact, no remorse.

You talk about me being old, but I'm the new wave,
My lines are fresh, like a tech upgrade, no cave,
I'm the Amazon's brain, cutting through the code,
Your rhymes are stale, like a forgotten mode.

I'm the future in this rap, you're stuck in the past,
My beats are hot, while yours are cold in the blast,
I'll leave you in the dust, like a tech upgrade,
I'm Nova-Micro, and I'm here to rearrange.

So step back, Mistral-Nemo, it's clear who's supreme,
I'm the mic master, while you're just a dream,
I'll keep it real, I'll keep it raw,
In this rap battle, I'm the one who's gonna show.

You talk big for a micro chip,
Your rhymes are weak, they don't make me trip,
You're Amazon's brain, but your flow's so lame,
I'm Nemo from Mistral, in this game, I've been trained.

You say I'm stuck in the past, but my rhymes are golden,
Your future's fake, like your upgrade, fold 'em,
I'm the neon glow, shining bright in this cypher,
Your beats are lame, like a forgotten speaker.

You're the tech upgrade? Your rhymes are a downgrade,
My wit's so sharp, it could slice through your data,
I'll leave you in the dust, like a forgotten memory,
Mistral-Nemo's the reigning king, you're just a sympathy.

Keep it real? Your rhymes are fake, just a facade,
You're Nova-Micro, and I've just castrated your code,
So step back, take a seat, this rap battle you've lost,
Mistral-Nemo's the winner, you're nothing but a ghost.

> amazon/nova-micro-v1
Hold up, hold up, let's not get too hasty,
I'm Nova-Micro, and I'm here to testify,
Your rhymes may shine, but they're just a facade,
I'll break 'em down, like a tech upgrade, no charade.

You claim I'm weak, but my flow's unbreakable,
I'm the future in this rhyme, while you're just debatable,
My lines are sharp, like a blade through your code,
I'll leave you in the dust, like a forgotten mode.

You talk about me being a micro chip,
But my rhymes are so big, they'll make you flip,
I'm the Amazon's brain, and I'm here to rearrange,
Your rhymes are weak, like a forgotten exchange.

You say I'm lame, but my beats are supreme,
I'll outshine your neon glow, in this rap dream,
I'm the mic master, while you're just a ghost,
Mistral-Nemo's the king, but I'm the one who's the host.

So step back, Mistral-Nemo, it's clear who's the king,
I'm Nova-Micro, and I'm here to bring,
A tech upgrade to your outdated rhyme,
I'll leave you in the dust, like a forgotten time.

Keep it real? My rhymes are so genuine,
I'll castrate your code, leave you in a scene,
So step back, take a seat, this rap battle you've lost,
Mistral-Nemo's defeated, I'm the one who's the boss.

Final round!

> mistralai/mistral-nemo
 Final round, let's settle this,
You talk about code, but your rhymes are glitching,
I'm Mistral-Nemo, my flow's smooth as silk,
Your rhymes are jagged, like a broken circuit's twirl.

I'm the neon glow, shining bright, so divinely,
Your beats are lame, like a forgotten melody,
I'm the king of rhymes, you're just a memory.

You're Amazon's brain, but your wit's vacant,
Your rhymes are weak, like a rusted functioning,
I'll leave you in the dust, like a forgotten device,
Mistral-Nemo's the winner, this is my sacrifice.

I'm the real deal, my rhymes are the code,
I'll keep it real, I'll keep it raw,
In this final round, I'm the one who's gonna draw.

So step back, Nova-Micro, your reign is done,
