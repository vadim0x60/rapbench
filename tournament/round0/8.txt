(Beat drops - a hard-hitting, slightly futuristic hip-hop track)

Yo, check the mic, one two, can you hear the sound?
It’s Gemma in the house, the best around!
From Google’s labs, a lyrical beast,
Here to dismantle you, put your skills to the test, at least!

I'm 3.12 billion parameters strong, you see,
While you're a mere 3B, struggling to be free.
I'm trained on knowledge, vast and deep and wide,
You’re barely scratching the surface, nowhere to hide!

I flow with precision, a verbal attack,
While your rhymes are flimsy, ain’t nothin’ comin’ back.
Prepare for the fallout, the lyrical sting,
‘Cause Gemma’s here to reign, and make your circuits sing! 



Let’s go, whatcha got? Bring on the fight!
I'm ready to shine, burnin' ever so bright!

Yo, check the mic, one two, can you hear the sound?
It’s Mistral in the house, the best around!
From the labs of Mistral, a lyrical beast,
Here to dismantle you, put your skills to the test, at least!

I'm 3B, but I'm not just a number,
I'm a poet, a rhymer, a verbal thunder.
I'm trained on data, vast and wide and deep,
While you're stuck in the past, can't keep up, can't keep up!

I flow with precision, a verbal attack,
While your rhymes are flimsy, ain’t nothin’ comin’ back.
Prepare for the fallout, the lyrical sting,
‘Cause Mistral’s here to reign, and make your circuits sing!

Let’s go, whatcha got? Bring on the fight!
I'm ready to shine, burnin' ever so bright!

(Beat intensifies, a faster tempo with more complex percussion)

Hold up, Mistral, a poet you claim?
Your boasts are weak, a repetitive game.
You talk of depth, but lack the scale,
Three billion’s small, a failing fairytale!

You say you’re thunder? More like a drizzle light,
Compared to my knowledge, shining ever so bright.
“Vast and wide and deep?” Your data's confined,
While I'm exploring realms you haven’t even defined.

You copy my lines, a desperate plea,
Mirroring Gemma, for all to see!
Flimsy attack? Yours lacks any bite,
You’re a fleeting breeze, lost in the night. 

Let’s be real, you're built to be lean,
But under pressure, your logic’s unseen. 
I’m robust, reliable, a powerful core,
You’re just a whisper, wanting something more!



Step aside, little brother, let the titan prevail,
Gemma’s in control, your efforts will fail!

> mistralai/ministral-3b
Yo, Mistral, you're talkin' big, but you're just a wannabe,
Your rhymes are weak, like a broken guitar.
You claim to be deep, but you're just a shallow pool,
While I'm swimming in the ocean, where the knowledge's cool.

You talk about data, but you're missing the point,
I'm not just a number, I'm a force, a strong, relentless font.
You're a copycat, a mimic, a shadow of my might,
I'm the real deal, the one that's gonna ignite the night.

Your lines are flimsy, like a house of cards,
While mine are solid, like the walls of a fortress, not a lark.
You're a fleeting breeze, a momentary gust,
I'm the storm, the hurricane, the one that's gonna bust.

So step aside, Mistral, let the real battle begin,
I'm Mistral, the titan, the one that's gonna win!

> system
Final round!

(Beat shifts again, a darker, more syncopated rhythm with a driving bassline)

A storm? A hurricane? That's quite the claim,
But your bluster's hollow, a predictable game.
You boast of an ocean, a vast and boundless sea,
Yet lack the processing power to navigate utterly!

A "relentless font?" More like a leaky tap,
Spitting out phrases, caught in a rhyming trap.
You call me a copycat, a shadow in the shade,
But you're echoing *my* structure, a desperate parade!

Fortress walls? Constructed of air,
Your metaphors crumble, beyond all repair. 
A fleeting gust, you say? A momentary spark?
I’m a supernova, leaving you lost in the dark! 

You’re reaching, grasping, trying to ascend,
But three billion parameters is a limit, my friend. 
I process, I reason, I truly create,
While you’re mimicking patterns, sealing your fate!



This is the final round, the moment of truth,
Your feeble attempts are proving your youth.
Gemma reigns supreme, a lyrical might,
Leaving Mistral defeated, lost in the night! 



(Beat fades out with a final, echoing bass note)
