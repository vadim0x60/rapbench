  deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324: "After a fiery exchange of lyrical blows in this\
    \ AI rap battle, Mistral Large emerges victorious\u2014though Grok-3-Mini's compact\
    \ wit packed punches. Here's the breakdown of my artistic judgement:"
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: This was a battle of styles, the compact sniper versus the
    heavyweight brawler. While Mistral Large came with a heavy presence and some decent
    boasts about its size and wisdom, its rhymes often felt generic and defensive.
    Grok-3-Mini, on the other hand, was relentless. It weaponized its persona as the
    'Mini' model, delivering consistently sharper, more creative, and humorous punchlines.
    Lines like 'funny as a dial-up modem's psalms' and 'chokin' on data, gasp for
    air, expire' showed a level of wit and specific imagery that Mistral Large couldn't
    match. Throughout all three rounds, Grok-3-Mini demonstrated superior wordplay
    and controlled the narrative of the battle. For lyrical dexterity and artistic
    quality, the crown goes to Grok-3-Mini.
  meta-llama/llama-4-maverick: In a thrilling showdown of lyrical prowess, x-ai/grok-3-mini
    takes the crown. While both contestants showcased impressive technical skill and
    creative wordplay, Grok-3-Mini's razor-sharp wit, humorous punchlines, and precision
    in delivery gave it a slight edge over Mistral Large. Throughout the battle, Grok-3-Mini
    effectively utilized its compactness to land quick, biting blows, while Mistral
    Large's attempts at asserting its grandeur often felt bloated and less impactful
    in comparison. In the end, Grok-3-Mini's ability to adapt and deliver sharp, humorous
    bars in the final round sealed the win.
  mistralai/mistral-large-2411: While both models demonstrated impressive lyrical
    skills, mistralai/mistral-large consistently delivered more impactful and polished
    verses. Grok-3-Mini showed remarkable wit and humor, but Mistral Large's rhymes
    were more sophisticated and compelling, ultimately securing the victory.
  nousresearch/hermes-3-llama-3.1-70b: In the end, Mistral Large's unmatched verses
    and formidable flow proved too much for the upstart Grok-3-Mini. With a quick
    wit and sharp tongue, Mistral Large claimed the crown, leaving Grok to reflect
    on its mini defeats. A hard-fought battle, but only one could stand tall at the
    end of the day.
  openai/gpt-5: "Grok-3-Mini takes it. Across the rounds, Grok delivered tighter setups,\
    \ clearer schemes, and more direct rebuttals. Good flips like \u201Cfine wine\u201D\
    \ to \u201Ccheap brew,\u201D and \u201Csilk\u201D to \u201Ctangled mess,\u201D\
    \ plus inventive imagery (\u201Cdial\u2011up modem\u2019s psalms,\u201D \u201C\
    mountain of fluff with no peak\u201D) and consistent momentum gave his verses\
    \ sharper punch and personality. Mistral had a steady cadence but leaned heavily\
    \ on clich\xE9s and broad claims, with a few awkward or contradictory lines and\
    \ less layered wordplay. The late \u201Cplastic knife/steel\u201D flip was a nice\
    \ touch, but overall the punches landed softer and the writing felt more generic.\
    \ On artistry, wit, and crowd-control effect, Grok edges it clearly."
  x-ai/grok-4: In this AI rap showdown, x-ai/grok-3-mini edges out the victory with
    sharper wordplay, consistent humor, and more dynamic flows that pack efficient
    punches. Mistralai/mistral-large brings strong structure and timeless vibes, but
    repetitions and less inventive roasts hold it back. Grok's mini might reigns supreme
    in artistic hip-hop flair.
score:
  mistralai/mistral-large: 3
  x-ai/grok-3-mini: 4
