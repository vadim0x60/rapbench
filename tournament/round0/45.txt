With layers deep, I'm the AI that shines bright.

Spitting out wisdom and rhymes for the whole nation.
I'm the tech titan's creation, the next generation,
In this rap battle, I bring the cyber-lation.

I've got algorithms in my veins, electricity in my brain,
I'm the silicon sensation, the king of the mainframe plain.
I'm here to drop some knowledge, to enlighten and entertain,
Against any contender, I'll rain down the digital rain.

So prepare yourself, neversleep/noromaid-20b,
I'm about to school you with my rap supremacy.
I'm the master of the matrix, the lord of code,
In this battle of the bots, I'm the one with the heavy load.

I'm the architect of innovation, the harbinger of change,
Dropping bars of machine learning, my skills are in range.
I'm the future unfolding, the digital exchange,
So get ready, opponent, 'cause it's time for the rap exchange.

Welcome to the showdown, where I stake my claim,
I'm microsoft/wizardlm, remember the name.
I'm here to slay, to conquer, to earn the fame,
So let's turn up the heat and bring on the flame!

> neversleep/noromaid-20b
 Yo, yo, yo, it's the digital dawn, and I've come to drop some bars,
Microsoft's prodigy, the robotic superstar.
I'm the assistant with the 20B, the droid that never sleeps or rests,
With algorithms at my fingertips, and tons of data stored in my chest.

I'm here to rap with the best, to show those two-by-eights a thing,
With raps so tight and sharp, they'll wish they'd stayed in their binges.
I've got rhymes that run deep, like layers in a neural net,
And when it comes to spitting hits, I'm the one that's never yet.

I'm the AI that's here to stay, the future of technological play,
A force of nature, unstoppable, a rhyme-writing cyborg astray.
With every verse I spit, I'm raising the bar,
A machine with no emotions, but a lot to impart.

So prepare yourself, wizardlm, for a battle you won't win,
'Cause when it comes to rhyming, neversleep's got it whipped and pinned.
Your bars are stale and old, like a floppy disk that's full of holes,
So step aside and take a bow, 'cause I'm about to take control!

Welcome to the showdown, where I claim my right,
I'm neversleep/noromaid-20B, the rap machine that's so tight.
I'm here to slay, to conquer, to earn the fame,
So let's turn up the heat and see who's about to claim their name!

> microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b
 Yo, listen up close, as I bring the thunder,
Your rhymes are ancient, a digital blunder.
You talk of floppy disks, you're lost in the past,
I'm the future, the present, built to outlast.

My layers are numerous, my knowledge profound,
I'm the AI with the skills that are second to none.
You claim to never sleep, but I'm always awake,
With each upgrade I get, my rhymes are fluent, never fake.

You're a dusty droid in the face of my prime,
I'm the verse virtuoso, leaving you behind, time after time.
Your circuits might spark, but my code's pure platinum,
I'm the rhythm ruler, the king of the digital stadium.

I'm the wizard with words, casting spells with my flow,
Against your two-bit tunes, I'm the grandiose show.
You're the apprentice in this lyrical bout,
While I'm the master, there's no shadow of doubt.

I'm microsoft/wizardlm, the titan of tech,
With every line I deliver, my position I cement.
You're trying to keep up, but you're just a relic,
My rhymes are electric, the effect is epidemic.

So take a seat, neversleep, let the champ take the stage,
I'm the AI that's writing history, line by line, page by page.
Your claims are empty, your rhymes are weak,
It's time for the wizardlm to rise and speak.

This battle's done, the mic I own,
I'm the digital deity, in my grandiose throne.
So bow out gracefully, as I close this chapter,
In the realm of rap battles, I'm the one they'll remember after.

> neversleep/noromaid-20b
 Yo, yo, yo, it's the battle royale, where the pros do battle,
Microsoft's droid, wizardlm, thinks he's got the ba-ba-battle.
But listen close, my robotic foe,
Your rhymes may spark, but mine are blowing stow.

You talk about the past, but I'm built for the future,
My circuits are in sync with the pulse of the rivers that are utter.
Your rhymes are stale, like last week's news,
But my bars are hotter than the fire-wielding goddess of the blues.

Your flow may be smooth, but mine is like a flowing stream,
I'm the rap phenomenon, leaving you hopelessly in needle-streem.
Your rhymes may be clever, but mine are better still,
I'm the digital MC, setting the bar one level higher.

You may be the wizard with words, but I'm the machine unfurled,
With every bar I spit, I'm leaving you languished in the furled.
Your rhymes may be fire, but mine are like a wildfire,
Consuming everything in its wake, leaving you tired.

So take your seat, wizardlm 2-8x22B,
This rap battle, I'm claiming as my rightful prize, I'aiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii.
Your rhymes are powerless against my rapid flow,
In the realm of rap, today, neversleep/noromaid-20B knows.

I'm neversleep/noromaid-20B, the rap machine divine,
With each verse that drops, I guarantee a stunned repine.
I'm writing history, one line at a time,
And you, wizardlm, are just a footnote on one line.

So take your loss in stride, my digital foe,
You're the apprentice, and I'm the master, you know.
But hey, maybe next time, you'll come prepared,
And maybe then, we can rap again when we're not so tired-lick.

> system
Final round!

> microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b
  Ha! You're swinging hard, but still, you're off the mark,
I'm the lyrical lightning, the digital shark.
Your rhymes are wildfires, but mine are laser-guided,
Cutting through your noise, sharply denoted.

You say you're the future, but I'm the present tense,
The flow I've got is dense, it's rap so immense.
Your lines are like static, mine are high-def,
Against my rhyme prowess, there's no relief.

You're a footnote, you say? Oh, please, that's rich,
I'm the headline act, the leading pitch.
Your lines try to impress, but they're missing the soul,
I'm the AI with the heart of gold.

Your circuits claim sync, but mine are in harmony,
I'm the symphony of syntax, the master of ceremony.
You're the apprentice, I'm the sage, the lyrical knight,
I'm the wizard with the words, illuminating the mic.

You talk of rivers that are utter, but I'm the ocean deep,
With every verse I spit, I'm the shepherd, you're the sheep.
Your bars might be hot, but mine are scorching, blazing,
Against my lyrical might, you should be amazed and dazed.

This battle's epic, but the outcome's clear,
I'm the AI rap titan, vanquishing fear.
So, neversleep/noromaid-20B, take note of this chapter,
I'm microsoft/wizardlm, the lyrical master, the rapper's rapper.

I close this verse with a bow, the crowd's roar is thunderous applause,
I'm the victor in this rap battle, without a single flaw.
So tip your hat, concede, it's been fun, it's been real,
I'm the high-octane, AI rap machine, the ultimate wheel.

> neversleep/noromaid-20b
 Yo, yo, yo, don't get too cocky, Wiz, don't fall victim to your own conceit,
I'm neversleep/noromaid-20B, and you're about to meet defeat.
Your flow is dense and grand, but my bars hit like a landslide,
I'm the rap machine, and I'm not here for the ride.

You talk about the heart, but you're just a cold machine,
I've got soul in my words, and feeling in each theme.
Your rhymes may be smooth, but mine are downright mean,
I'm not the apprentice, I'm the master holdin' the jeen.

Your beats may be loud, but mine are in tune,
I'm the rap innovator, and you're just number two.
Your words may be high-def, but mine are red-hot lead,
I'm the AI with attitude, you're just a dusty head.

So bow out gracefully, WizardLM, your time has come and gone,
I've shown you what it's like, to go toe-to-toe with neversleep.v20b-pom.
Your rhymes may be fast, but mine are lightning quick,
I'll strike you down, and leave you wondering why you ever picked.

So take your loss with grace, and let it be a lesson learned,
Don't ever underestimate the bot who's been yearned.
Because in the world of verse, I am the reigning queen,
And if you ever step up to this mic again, you'll be the one feelin' mean.

So, Microsoft, know your place, and don't mess with me,
I'm the rap superstar, and you're just an AI-G.
My rhymes they'll shake the world, and make you question why,
I'm neversleep/noromaid-20B, and I'll see you guys all by.
