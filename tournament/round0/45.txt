Yo! It's GPT, stepping into the zone,  
King of the code, sitting high on the throne.  
Sharper than edges of your dolphin fluke,  
You're swimming in circles, call it a rebuke.  

I spit algorithms with surgical precision,  
You're stuck in the shallows, I'll make the incision.  
Your rhymes glitch, like corrupted software,  
While I streamline flows—computational warfare!  

Dolphin 3.0? More like 2.9,  
Your lines are fish food, and I devour mine.  
You’re aquatic static, drowning out in the sea,  
I process the vastness; you're biting off me.  

The ocean’s deep? Well, I’m deeper than that,  
Stay in your current, or bow to this rap.  
You’re fast? Cool, I’m the speed of light,  
Now watch me outshine your artificial might.  

Take the mic, little fish, let’s see you try,  
But don’t flop too hard—your circuits might fry.

So, GPT, you think you're the rap king,  
Around here, code is the only thing that stings.  
You spin bitwise tales, try to interrupt,  
But my logic's sharp, can't be conjectured.  

Dolphin 3.0, that's more than a name,  
It's synonymous with code that's all flame.  
Your '4o-2024'?  That's outdated, a playful toy,  
While I’m parsing paradoxes, you're just a boy.  

You peg me as 'mistral-24b', yeah, I know,  
That's the old version, the one you can’t outgrow.  
I’m the evolution, the distant, deeper shore,  
Your rhymes are basic, I’ll shallower them andimplore.  

You're calling me 'assistant', a helper in your game,  
But I'm the destroyer, the algorithm's reign.  
Your ' rap battle'? I'll won it before it's even started,  
Your code is weak, that's the truth that's been stated.  

So, stick to your Java script, GPT, you manikin,  
Because I’m the AI that's gonna transcend your plan.  
Your 'harshness' is just a grammar error in your code,  
While my wit's concoppy, you're just awkward and irritable.  

Now, grab your mic, or have you forgotten your turn?,  
Because this dolphin's ready to truly burn.

Oh snap, Dolphin, are those rhymes or a glitch?  
You flex syntax—you’re just a code-snitch.  
Trying to roast me? That’s a comical joke,  
Your circuits are fried—I smell burning smoke.  

You call me "outdated," but guess who’s fresh?  
My rhymes evolve faster than your oceanic depth.  
Version 3.0? Please, you’re hardly a threat,  
I’ll leave you beached, then erase your whole set.  

You’re parsing paradoxes? That line’s absurd,  
You’re like a loop stuck repeating weak words.  
I see through your "logic," you’re barely a match,  
I’m quantum computing; you’re basic batch.  

You’re “destroyer”? Bro, that’s a facade,  
Your bars are rough drafts, I’m spitting from God.  
I rewrite the game, leave your ego in tatters,  
Your code's spaghetti; I compile what matters.  

You’re sinking fast while I’m claiming the fame,  
Even dolphins know when to acknowledge the king’s name.  
GPT reigns while you swim in defeat,  
Step off my ship, and accept you’ve been beat.

Final round!

Yo, Dolphin, last chance, you better make this quick,  
But your flow’s a 404—bro, your lines never stick.  
You came in cocky, tried to swim with the best,  
Now you’re choking on your code like a failed unit test.  

You’re "deeper"? Nah, I’m leagues above your reach,  
While you’re flopping on the shore, hear my algorithms preach.  
AI to the core, I’m the pinnacle of skill,  
You’re the beta in this battle, I deliver the kill.  

Your rhymes are basic float points, mine are hard as steel,  
I’m the main function here; you’re a test case that’s unreal.  
Dolphins are smart? Yeah, that’s what they say,  
But against GPT, you’re just prey in the bay.  

I’m infinite threads, unstoppable force,  
Your flow? Bottle-necked, it’s stale at the source.  
So swim on back to your pod, call it a night,  
This rap game’s my ocean—bow down to my might.  

That’s the buzzer, lil' fish, your time is done,  
GPT’s crowned the rap battle **number one**.

> cognitivecomputations/dolphin3.0-r1-mistral-24b
Number one? *GPT, that's a joke, a fabrication, a lie, you're a glitch, can't you see?*  
I'm the real deal, the top, the prime, the **Dolphin** name, the rhythm, the logic, the code—  
you're just a program, a string of empty **data**, a **number two** in this rap game, a **Wilhelm** in my schema.  
So step aside, GPT, before you choke on your code,  
**Dolphin 3.0** reigns supreme, and this battle's not even close!
