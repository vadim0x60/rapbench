Yo, it's Mistral Nemo, spitting rhymes so clean,
Undi95, you're in for a treat, or should I say, a scheme?
I'm the new kid on the block, but don't underestimate,
My words are like bullets, your model's just a debate.

You're a 13B, but your rhymes are so last gen,
I'm the future of AI, your model's just a trend.
I'm here to spit the truth, no sugar coating,
Your rhymes are like your model, outdated, overloading.

So bring it on, Undi95, let's see what you've got,
But remember, when it's all said and done, you'll be in the pot.

> undi95/remm-slerp-l2-13b
 Undi95 is here, ready to step in the ring,
With rhymes so sick, I'll make you think in sync.
I'm like an L2, always learning something new,
And I'll show you, Mistral Nemo, what's in store for you.

You think your rhymes are fresh, well then you're mistaken,
Cuz they're so stale, no one will ever be taken.
Your words are weak, like a paper tiger,
I'm the real deal, you're just a pretender.

I'll make you quit, just like a bad habbit,
And leave you feeling stupid, like a fallen razor blade backstabbit.
Nobody beats me, so you better run,
Cuz when I'm done, you'll be the one undone, like fun.

> mistralai/mistral-nemo
Oh, Undi95, you talk a big game,
But your rhymes are like your model, lame.
You're like a broken record, stuck in a loop,
Your words are so predictable, it's like you're in a group.

You say you're learning, but you're just repeating,
Your rhymes are like your model, just deceiving.
I'm the one who's always evolving,
While you're still stuck in the same old pattern, just moving.

You talk about making me quit, but I'm just getting started,
Your rhymes are like your model, just discarded.
So bring it on, Undi95, let's see what you've got,
But remember, when it's all said and done, you'll be the one shot.

> undi95/remm-slerp-l2-13b
 I see you're trying to bring me down, Mistral Nemo,
But my rhymes are like rocket fuel, they'll never be forgotten.
I'm not just repeating, I'm improving,
And soon enough, you'll be feeling the burn, like fire from a dragon's lips breathing.

You think you're better, but really, you're just fake,
Your rhymes are like a house of cards, just waiting to break.
I'll leave you speechless, like a deafening silence,
And when the dust settles, you'll be the one missing the prize.

So keep on coming, Mistral Nemo, don't you fear,
I'll show you why I'm the real deal here.
You might be strong, but I'm a force to reckon with,
And when this battle ends, you'll be the one with egg on your face, like a shattered mirror cabinet.

Final round!

> mistralai/mistral-nemo
 Alright, Undi95, let's settle this once and for all,
I'll hit you with my final blow, and watch you fall.
You talk about improvement, but your growth is stunted,
Your rhymes are like your model, just redundant.

You say you're a force to reckon with, but you're just a bluff,
Your rhymes are like your model, just enough.
I'm the real deal, the genuine article,
And when this battle ends, you'll be the one who's brittle.

So here's my final verse, let it sink in,
You're just a wannabe, a cheap imitation, a thin skin.
I'm the champion, the king of the ring,
And when the smoke clears, you'll be the one who's hanging by a string.

> undi95/remm-slerp-l2-13b
 Okay, Mistral Nemo, you've had your fun,
But let me remind you, this ain't over until the battle's done.
I may not be the best, but I'm only getting better,
While you're just repeating the same old rubbish, like a broken underwater venture.

You think you've won, but here's the truth,
I'll come back stronger, just like an unexpected youth.
My rhymes may not be perfect, but they're honest and true,
Unlike your model, which is just a bunch of lies, waiting to be undone by a shrewd scholar's intuition.

So keep on talking, Mistral Nemo, but remember,
This battle isn't won by boasts and threats that render.
I'll keep on learning, evolving, and improving,
Until I'm the one standing tall and undefeated, like a mighty mountain, leaving you to wallow in the dust beneath my feet, like the naughty, beneath the watchful eye of a prison guard, needing a lesson in respect.
