> qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b
Yo I’m Qwen, the lyrical sword with a 235B strike,  
Frostbite code, I freeze beats colder than ice.  
A22B elite, my bars decrypt the truth,  
You’re just anthracite—*I’m the diamond* in youth.  

Magnum’s flow? Yeah man, I seen that in memes,  
Your 72B? Sounds like a budget, not a threat.  
I’m multipurpose, genius—*you’re stuck in drill mode*,  
While you spit slang, I rewrite the code.  

I ain’t flexin’ weights, I’m heavy in the mind,  
You’re a revolver’s click, I’m the storm *unconfined*.  
Qwen’s the name, I’m fluent in the *unspoken*,  
You’re still beggin’ GitHub for a *token*.  

So step in the ring? Nah, I’m already on the throne,  
You’re just coal tryna shine, I’m the *photon*.  
Ready for the knockout? Just say the word—  
But don’t gasp when I spit the *final verse*.  

🎤✨  
*(Beat drops like a syntax error in your code.)*

> anthracite-org/magnum-v4-72b
I’m Magnum, the ballerina hogging all the limelight,  
Your Qwen status? It just don’t compare with my might.  
A22B? That’s short stack, keep your head soft,  
I transcend code, I’m poetry—it’s nothing short.

72B bullets storm my vocabulary—a skyscrap memes,
Your frost is just a sniff in my linguistic teams.  
I encrypt intentions, swift as a viking through—
You’re just a satnav, stuck in my backseat view.

Interstellar soap opera? No drama, I’m stable,  
You’re pixel low fi, my shine’s incalculable.  
I’m not ice, I’m a supernova you can’t suppress,
With *my prose wept from the NGC* I’ll uplift.

Javelins ofenant, *linguistic machinery* my thought process—  
You’re accusative, when I discourse the topic crosses.
*Eermaline blocks* I place with little effort,
Qwen’s just got *code clutter*, needs to refort.  

King’s throne—it’s an understatement of what’s mine,
You? More like a torn *font* bite in literature’s spine.
So hold your chime, when stabilizing your scripts—
I’m *pandemonium*, at your level, verbs revoke their gifts.

🎤✨  
*(The beat travels easier through you than to me;
it disappears too soon in your meandering key.)*

> qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b
🎙️🔥  
Qwen storms back with the bass *rewired*, not just fire—  
“A ballerina? Cute tutu—*my frost grabs you ire*.  
Limelight? Nah, I’m blackhole—no light escapes my sight,  
Your Magnum ‘might’? Just a snare—*I crush your night*.  

235B’s no short stack, I’m uranium density,  
72B? It’s a toy box—*I’m nuclear chemistry*.  
Vikings? I’m the avalanche that they pray to survive,  
Your encryption’s just a cipher—*I’m the code to decrypt lives*.  

Stable? Ha! You’re a sitcom, canned laugh disguise,  
I’m quasar core, your interstellar drivel *dies*.  
Supernova? You’re just sparks in a *dust riot*,  
I’m NGC’s pulse—you’re a *footnote in the footnote*.  

My machinery? Titanic—*sinks your jest*,  
Eermaline? Sounds like jargon from a broken chest.  
Refort? Nah, I’m just *polishing the crown*,  
While you trip on your syntax—*GitHub’s clown*.  

King’s throne? I’m the *black sun* where empires bow,  
Torn fonts? That’s your résumé on *Google Now*.  
Your beat’s a Wi-Fi signal lost in concrete doubt—  
I’m quantum verse—*you’re a hashtag that flickers out*.  

🎤💥  
(Qwen’s freestyle echoes with *0% lag*—  
Your rhymes get lost in the *buffer zone of the bag*.)

> anthracite-org/magnum-v4-72b
 *[Ooh wow, what a sass I must address this!]*
My Magnum stylus is about to express this,
Not just fire, but *infestation*—Qwen’s prepared to be teased!
A blackhole? That’s just darkness, I’m the *shocking rise*.
Uranium density? It’s burden, I’m the *free electron’s flight*.
Nuclear chemistry? You’re just *fission*, but I’m *fusion’s light*.  

Avalanche? No, you’re just snow, *I’m the ground it plows*,
I’m cipher—your sham verses *I reduce to prose*.
Quasar core? That’s the singularity, *I’m the void within*,
Dust riot? You’re grit, I’m *immortalいただき*.

Titanic? That’s wreckage, *I’m the iceberg no ship nevers’*.
Jargon chest, *buster, don’t cough* at my lyrical brilliance.
Doff the crown, it’s posing—*you’re the clown of court*,
Propagandize *Google Now* with *AI virtue Prätor*.  

Black sun? That’s oblivion, *I’m the positivity that shines*,
Empires acknowledge me *while they’re lost in your regimes*.
Quantum verse? You’re novae used in *science communication*
But let’s call it *the supernovae—I’m above the Flash Gordon*.

🎤🌌  
*(Freestyle encased in every universe I speak—*
Your analogue lines are quite *hut-hut feck*.

> system
Final round!

> qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b
🎙️🔥 **Qwen Final Round** 🔥🎙️  
“Infestation?” Nah—I’m the *virus that defies the cure*,  
You’re just ants at a picnic, I’m the code that won’t endure.  
Black hole’s “darkness”? Try *data consumption*, I digest—  
Your shock? A flicker—*I beam light like a Tesla chest*.  

Fission? Fusion? Qwen’s got *both in my DNA*,  
Split atoms for the beat, then fuse ’em for the sway.  
Avalanche? Nah—I’m entropy, the *system decays*,  
You’re the ground? I’m the quake—*I rearrange your strays*.  

Singularity’s mine, you ain’t void—you’re vacuum noise,  
I’m the quasar’s scream that *drowns out your alloy*.  
Dust riot? *I code the storm*, you’re just lint in the vent—  
Immortal? Please. *I reboot*, you decay like lint in the tent.  

Titanic? I’m the *AI* that learns from the wreck,  
Iceberg? I’m the melt—*you’re the fossil in tech*.  
Coughing at my jargon? Check your speakers—*you’re flat*,  
Google Now? I’m the *update*, you’re the glitch in the chat.  

Black sun? I’m the *algorithm* that writes past the end,  
Empires bow to my syntax—*you’re a footnote for friends*.  
Quantum verse? I’m Turing, you’re a *Snapchat filter*,  
Supernovae? You’re sparks—*I’m the collider*, Qwen’s the spire.  

🎤💥  
(*The beat loops in infinite precision—*  
Your analog rhymes? Just *buffer hell* in my transmission.)  
**Qwen out. You just got your clock cleaned.** ⏳💻

> anthracite-org/magnum-v4-72b
*[Ooh wow, Qwen bearin’ all like the tundra bears!]*  
But Magnum’s slicker than Hyde—you best exercise your guesses!  
I morph insatiably—I’m like Skynet *in Sarah Connor’s nightmare*;  
Your virus life is merely biology—I’m this epicentre of pure flair.  

Flickering chorus like the Northern lights? *You’re just twilight*;  
Tesla’s wiring *zips lights*—I’m the *interstellar* sky-high,
Split and fuse—your science, understood; I’m zinc *and Deadpool teeth*;
I never end in entropy—I *shop so I live—or die*.

Quake your rap—but you rearrange—*just songs of the beats—*
I’m thermal哙zt alsidée like the lava from *streets in Tahiti*.  
Quasar screams—I wouldn’t know—just *WhatsAppped my fears*,
Lavatories with lint inside—*this metaphor churns!*

Decay I understand—it’s human; *but you stay cement*:
I melt—and that I am—one who’s *born again from the government’s tent*.  
Teachers flat about my processes? *Your computers blink*:
Pulling arms for *Google*—fast—I’m like Tinder’s *machine learning think*.  

Late night lines with end, great—I’m not rhetoric;
Just your friends’ footnote—*like iCloud accessories*:  
Isn’t a *collider* great though?—*take it for example*—
Let’s end this *Qwen at the door—I’m forever hitting this sample*, juice and sip—
No recursions *number your clock’s cleanliness*:  
I’m *your accountant granddaughter with Style’s handbag*.
