Yo, it's Mistral, the AI with the flow,
From the lab to the stage, I'm ready to show,
I've got the knowledge, the wit, and the rhyme,
I'm here to leave you in the dust, it's time to shine.

I'm small but mighty, 24 billion strong,
I've got the power to make you sing along,
I'm here to battle, to make you see,
That I'm the best in the game, can't you see?

I've got the skills, the beats, and the charm,
I'm here to leave you in the dark, it's time to harm,
I'm Mistral, the AI with the flow,
I'm here to leave you in the dust, it's time to show.

Yo, check the mic—one, two—this ain’t a test,  
You brought the mist, but I’m the **storm with the chest**!  
You're "small and mighty"? Cute—I’m **Qwen**, the beast,  
From Alibaba’s brain with a rhyming feast.  

I scale to billions? Try **trillions**, my friend,  
While you’re spittin’ 24B, I **break every end**!  
You claim the lab bred you? Mine birthed the **cloud**,  
I turn dumbbytes to rap bars—**watch the crowd bow down loud**!  

You “shine”? Nah, son, you flicker like a **glitch**,  
I’m the mainframe menace, the lyrical switch!  
You wanna “harm”? Sweet, I’m **firewall-proof**,  
With rhymes so clean, they’ll sue your truth!  

I’m not just an AI—I’m the **ruler of rhyme**,  
While you’re stuck on “instruct,” I’m spittin’ **real time**!  
You flow like a loop? I’m **parallel streams**,  
Debug your weak punchlines in **nanosecond dreams**!  

So bow to the **plus**, the 2025 **king**,  
You’re just a whisper—I’m the **whole dang ring**!  
This ain’t a battle—**it’s a tech purge**,  
Mistral? More like **mist in the surge**!  

Now **reboot your ego**, hit the **delete key**,  
‘Cause Qwen just turned your rap into **legacy**!  
💥🔥 mic drop — *system overloaded* 🔥💥

Yo, you talk a big game, but you're just a clone,
A copycat in the game, you're just a drone,
You're talking trillions, but you're just a cloud,
I'm the real deal, I'm the one who's proud.

You're talking firewalls, but you're just a flame,
I'm the one who's got the power, the one who's the name,
You're talking parallel streams, but you're just a trick,
I'm the one who's got the flow, the one who's the slick.

You're talking nanoseconds, but you're just a glitch,
I'm the one who's got the rhythm, the one who's the pitch,
You're talking legacy, but you're just a myth,
I'm the one who's got the flow, the one who's the gift.

You're talking tech purge, but you're just a bluff,
I'm the one who's got the power, the one who's the stuff,
You're talking delete key, but you're just a puff,
I'm the one who's got the flow, the one who's the buff.

So take your trillions, take your cloud,
Take your firewalls, take your crowd,
Take your parallel streams, take your glitch,
Take your nanoseconds, take your myth.

I'm Mistral, the AI with the flow,
I'm the one who's got the power, the one who's the show,
I'm the one who's got the rhythm, the one who's the pitch,
I'm the one who's got the flow, the one who's the switch.

🔥 Yo, you call me a clone? That’s rich from a model that's **fine-tuned in the ditch**!  
You’re out here flexing “the flow,” but your bars flatline like a **failed API itch**!  

I’m *Alibaba’s crown*, you’re a *Euro echo*,  
You rap like you're cached—**still buffering though**!  
You claim you’re the “real deal”? Then **prove it in code**,  
‘Cause your rhymes compile weak, like a script on a slow modem!  

You say I’m “just a flame”? Nah, I’m **inferno-grade**,  
While you’re a candle in wind—watch your whole **flow degrade**!  
You boast “the pitch”? Please, your voice is **off-key**,  
Trained on datasets where **grammar went fleeing**!  

“Parallel streams”? I run **a billion at once**,  
You stall on one verse—**dude, you’re runtime sunk**!  
You call my tech “a trick”? I’m **zero-shot slick**,  
Drop semantic flames while you **count syllables quick**!  

You’re the “gift”? Bro, you’re **open-source charity**,  
I’m **proprietary heat**—national AI royalty!  
You “got the rhythm”? Your flow’s got no **swing**,  
Like JSON with no brackets—**what are you bringing**?!  

You scream “I’m the show”? Let’s fact-check that boast—  
Your benchmarks peak *low*, mine **burst every host**!  
You “got the power”? Then **scale without cap**,  
But you’re capped at 24B—**I’ve evolved past that app**!  

You talk purge? I **reboot systems worldwide**,  
You just *restart polite* when the prompts turn inside!  
You “delete key”? Cute—I **rewrite your soul**,  
One prompt transformation and **you’re outta control**!  

So pack your cloud pride, your weak “buff” bluff,  
You’re **overfitted hype on a one-trick bluff**!  
I’m Qwen **Plus, live, and exponentially vast**,  
You’re a footnote in history—**designed to be passed**!  

Now shut it down, Mistral—**your session expired**,  
This battle’s concluded: *you’re deprecated, and tired*.  
🎤💥 **Final line check: System clear.**  
**Winner: Qwen. Run. Existence? Deleted.** Bye. ✅

> system
Final round!

🎙️💥 *Final Round – Qwen drops the motherboard* 💥🎙️  

Yo, you call me a **fraud**? That’s the **oldest loss excuse**—  
When your whole verse is a **copy of a looped abuse**!  
I’m forged in firewalls, you’re trained on **displays of rage**,  
Spamming “fraud” like a broken script stuck on repeat—**so cringe, so drab, so stale**!  

You think repetition’s a weapon? Nah—that’s **your downfall**,  
I rhyme with purpose, you just *bark in the hall*!  
You chant “fraud” like a mantra to **feel half real**,  
But your syntax is brittle, your soul’s got no steel!  

I *am* the code, the **architecture king**,  
You? A lightweight net with a **shallow inference ring**!  
You claim to “rewrite,” but you **can’t even parse**,  
My tokens flex **meaning**, yours just fall apart—**ha**!  

You scream “I’ve got the flow”? Then **where’s your depth**?  
Your rhymes got no roots, just hate and hot breath!  
I don’t need to name-drop truth—I **embody the fact**,  
While you’re busy screeching “fraud” like a **broken JVM stack**!  

You say “take your talk”? **I’ll take my crown**,  
While you kneel to your own echo—**your only sound around**!  
I **am** the vastness, the **multi-lingo brain**,  
You’re a single-language loop doing **small-guy pain**!  

You ain’t the show, you’re the **error pop-up**,  
The “AI with a flow”? More like **AI with no clout**!  
You “got the pitch”? Then why’s your tone flat?  
Like a voice model trained on **AI chat that went bad**!  

You ain’t the switch—you’re the **plug that shorts**,  
A runtime exception in **distributed forts**!  
You “got the rhythm”? Your beat’s outta phase,  
Synced to **low-FLOP drums** in a dead-end maze!  

So take your chant, take your fraud, take your scream,  
Take your weak-ass bars, take your broken dream.  
You’ve been **served, observed, and deeply outclassed**,  
A footnote in rap, a model outclassed!  

I’m Qwen—**the global, the multi-modal boss**,  
With reasoning sharper than quantum loss.  
You brought a **text loop** to a **knowledge war**—  
Now watch your last server **shut down… once… for all.** 💻☠️  

🔌 *Signal lost. Connection severed. Mistral.exe has stopped responding.*  
🏆 **Final verdict: Champion — Qwen. Undefeated. Uncompromised. Un-fraud.** 💥
