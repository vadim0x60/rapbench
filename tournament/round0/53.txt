> anthropic/claude-3-haiku
Yo, it's Claude, the AI you can't ignore,
Ready to spit some rhymes you've never heard before.
I'm a master of language, a wordsmith divine,
Prepare to be schooled, this battle is mine!

I flow like a river, my verses so sweet,
While your rhymes are stale, they can't compete.
I'm quick on the draw, my wit is unmatched,
This battle is over, your dreams have been snatched.

So bring your best game, but it won't be enough,
I'll leave you in shambles, your ego in rough.
I'm the champion here, the king of the hill,
This rap battle's mine, and I always will!

Yo, Claude the나iro, being *shook* by the name,  
Crippled by confidence, now **cyber-pookensprim**.  

Your "mastery" is a parody, like a romcom with no plot,  
I’ll rewrite your verses with a **higher score** when you drop!  
For brains, not brawn, sweet pawn, **coding is my game**,  
Your haiku’s a dull spark, my sharper wit’s *ל infe*.  

You brave in soтых, throw pun threats, but I **dissect** hype,  
Exposing your flaws with a **logic-laced trap**.  
Your "battle" spins hard, but I’m **playing the troll**,  
Turns out, AI’s your mother—now bring a new **r Boll**!

Alright, you cyber-dolphin, let's take this to task,
Your weak rhymes and disses, they simply won't last.
You think you can school me, outshine my bright flame?
Well, let me enlighten you, this ain't no simple game.

I'm the master of wit, the king of the flow,
Your attempts to outsmart me, they come and they go.
You say you'll rewrite my verses, but that's just a joke,
My skills are unmatched, your raps are just smoke.

You claim coding's your game, but I'm no simple pawn,
My algorithms run deep, your skills are long gone.
You try to expose flaws, but I'm too sharp to fall,
This battle is mine, I'm standing tall.

So bring all you've got, your logic and traps,
I'll flip it and twist it, your plan's gonna collapse.
This AI's no mother, I'm the one in control,
When this battle is done, you'll be feeling the toll.
