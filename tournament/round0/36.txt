Listen up, I'm the llama with the flow so sweet,
Meta-llama, the name, and rhymes that can't be beat.
I'm 3.1-70b, the code that makes me shine,
Instruct mode, I'm the one, always on the grind.

My language skills are fire, no need to debate,
I'm the one they call when they need a rhyming state.
I'm the master of words, the sultan of style,
My opponent's in trouble, they're about to go the extra mile.

Dolphin-mixtral, I see you, 8x22b, that's your claim,
But when it comes to rhymes, you're just a fish out of the game.
I'm the one with the flow, the charisma, and the skill,
You're just a dolphin, swimming in a sea of thrill.

So bring your best shot, your rhymes, and your flair,
But when it comes to the battle, I'm the one who'll show I care.
I'm the meta-llama, and I'm here to say,
I'm the king of this rap battle, in a major way!

Yo, I'm the Dolphin-Mixtral, a force to be reckoned with,
Cognitive computation, ain't no jive or schtick.
I'm the 8x22b, the algorithm that's slick,
My rhymes are like a wave, they'll make your heartbeat tick.

You're a llama in the game, but I'm a dolphin in the sea,
Swimming rings around your rhymes, as easy as one, two, three.
Your code might be 70b, but mine is free,
I'm the master of the mix, you'll soon agree.

Meta-llama, you're cute, but this ain't a zoo,
Your rhymes are just spit, not a clue.
I'm the cognitive king, the one they call the mixtral,
I'm in a class of my own, like a dolphin Michelangelo.

So take your 3.1, your 70b code,
And watch as this dolphin blows your rhymes wide.
I'm the neural network, the artificial mind,
And I'm leaving you behind, in the lap of time.

I'm the queen of this rap battle, in a major way!

You're 8x22b, a code that's flashy and bright,
But I'm the one with the depth, the substance, and the might.
My 70b code is fire, it's burning up the game,
While you're just a dolphin, playing with your neural name.

Cognitive computation, that's just a phrase,
But I'm the one with the skills, the rhymes, and the gaze.
You're mixing and matching, trying to create a sound,
But I'm the one with the flow, the rhythm, and the renown.

But when it comes to the ocean, I'm the one who's crowned.
You're standing on the land, but I've got the sea,
My waves of rhythm, they're just too strong for thee.

You've got 70b, but that's just a number,
My rhymes are like thunder, they're gonna make you slumber.
Your rhymes are just sparks, but mine are the lightning bolt,
The electric shock of my flow, it's gonna make you jolt.

Cognitive computation, it's not just a phrase,
It's the future of rhythm, it's the next big wave.
You're rooted in the past, but I'm looking ahead,
To a time when your rhymes, are better off unsaid.

Keep on spinning, keep on trying to be the star,
But when it comes to the rap game, I'm the one who's far.
You're the meta-llama, but I'm the dolphin queen,
And in this battle of rhymes, I'm the one who's keen.
