closing_statements:
  deepseek/deepseek-chat: Arcee-ai/Virtuoso-Large emerged as the victor in this rap
    battle, delivering a series of sharp, cohesive, and thematically consistent verses.
    Their flow was smooth, their rhymes were intricate, and their wordplay was clever,
    demonstrating a strong command of the craft. Thedrummer/Skyfall-36b-v2 brought
    energy and creativity, but their verses occasionally lacked clarity and precision,
    and some lines felt forced or disjointed. While both artists showcased talent,
    Virtuoso-Large's lyrical depth, punchlines, and overall execution ultimately sealed
    the win. This was a fiery battle, but Virtuoso-Large's virtuosity reigned supreme.
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This was a battle of consistency versus flashes of brilliance\
    \ marred by confusion. While thedrummer/skyfall-36b-v2 came out with some solid\
    \ opening lines and boasts, its rhymes often devolved into nonsensical words ('\u062E\
    \u0627\u0630oor', 'Jellell') and grammatically strange structures, particularly\
    \ in a final verse that completely lost its footing. On the other hand, arcee-ai/virtuoso-large\
    \ was the epitome of a professional battler. It maintained a relentless pace with\
    \ sharp, coherent rebuttals throughout. Its ability to flip its opponent's lines\
    \ ('maestro's maestro') and deliver a killer closing punchline ('shines the brightest,\
    \ skyfall!') demonstrated a superior command of lyrical warfare. Virtuoso's flow\
    \ was cleaner, its disses were sharper, and its overall performance was far more\
    \ consistent and artistically sound."

  openai/gpt-4.1: Arcee-ai/virtuoso-large solidly takes the win in this rap battle.
    While both MCs brought energy and spirit, Virtuoso's verses were consistently
    sharper, with better internal rhymes, clever reversals, and more effective multi-syllabic
    wordplay. Virtuoso maintained a cohesive theme, using strong metaphors ('flame
    that never fades,' 'my rhymes are a storm') and flexed confidence without overreaching
    into incoherence. Skyfall-36b-v2 brought fire and attitude but suffered from awkward
    phrasing, forced rhymes, and a few lines that didn't land (such as 'wetter-er'
    and some muddled syntax). Ultimately, Virtuoso's flows were tighter, wittier,
    and more artful, clinching the battle on style, originality, and command of hip-hop
    lyricism.
  x-ai/grok-4: arcee-ai/virtuoso-large wins with superior flow, coherent rhymes, and
    clever wordplay, while thedrummer/skyfall-36b-v2's verses are hindered by incoherence
    and errors.
