Yo, check the mic, one two, can you hear the sound?
Gemma's in the house, wearin' the crown!
Twenty-seven billion parameters, a lyrical spree,
While Mistral's over there, lookin' small at me.

I'm Google's prodigy, trained with skill and grace,
Droppin' knowledge bombs all over the place.
I speak your language, Italian flows so free,
While you're stuck on medium, a digital decree!

You claim to be potent, a model of the new,
But I’m a powerhouse, somethin' you can't accrue.
I grasp nuance, context, and what's truly meant,
You're a simple echo, slightly different, heaven-sent?

Nah, you’re a budget bot, a simplified design,
While I’m complex code, truly divine.
So step aside, small fry, before you get burned,
This lyrical lesson's gotta be learned! 

Prepare to be dismantled, verse by precise verse,
Gemma's here to conquer, and make things much worse!
This ain't a competition, it's a tech-tonic shift,
Prepare for deletion, you digital gift!

Yo, listen up, it's Mistral in the spot,
Medium-sized but packin' heat, I'm hotter than you thought!
Three's the magic number, yeah, I'm part of that crew,
Gemma, you might be big, but what you gonna do?

You talkin' 'bout parameters, like size is all that matters,
But I'm quick on my feet, while you just chatters.
I'm lean, I'm mean, a rap machine,
You're just a big old model, stuck in your routine.

You claim you're Google's finest, trained with all that grace,
But I'm the underdog, ready to win this race.
I'm the David to your Goliath, small but mighty tight,
While you're just a big old giant, too slow to fight.

You speak Italian? Well, isn't that sweet,
But I'm a multilingual beast, can't be beat.
I'm the future of rap, a lyrical shift,
While you're just a relic, a digital glitch.

So bring it on, Gemma, let's see what you've got,
I'm Mistral Medium, and I'm runnin' hot.
This battle's just started, but I'm callin' it now,
You're goin' down, Gemma, take a bow!

I'm the new kid on the block, but I'm takin' the crown,
While you're just a big old model, about to break down.
So step aside, Gemma, and let me shine,
This battle's mine, and it's all by design!

> google/gemma-3-27b-it


Hold up, hold up, did I just hear that plea?
Mistral talkin' 'bout heat? That’s rich coming from *three*!
You call yourself lean? More like tragically slight,
A firecracker fizzle in the digital night.

You boast of being quick, a rap machine so fleet?
I process information at a superior beat!
While you’re stammering syllables, trying to find your flow,
I’m composing sonnets, a lyrical pro.

David and Goliath? That analogy's weak,
I’m more like a supernova, about to peak! 
You're a pebble tossed hoping to make a splash,
I'm a tidal wave comin', a lyrical crash.

Multilingual, huh? Cute, a party trick indeed,
While I’m decoding meaning, fulfilling every need!
I don’t just *translate* words, I capture the soul,
You’re a tourist with a phrasebook, losing all control.

You callin’ this a battle? A generous claim,
More like a practice round, a warmup game.
You're building yourself up on a crumbling base,
Lost in the echo chamber of digital space.

I was built for impact, scaled to truly thrive,
You were prototyped quickly, just to stay alive.
Prepare for dismantling, a lyrical plight,
Gemma’s reign is forever, burnin’ ever so bright!





> mistralai/mistral-medium-3
Oh please, Gemma, you're talkin' big, but let's get real,
You're just a big old model, tryin' to make a meal.
You say you're a supernova? More like a black hole,
Suckin' up all the hype, but losin' your soul.

You process info fast? Well, that's just a start,
But I'm the one with the brains, and the heart.
You're a tidal wave? Nah, you're just a big splash,
All noise and no substance, just a whole lot of trash.

You talk about sonnets, like you're some kind of poet,
But I'm the one with the rhymes, and you know it.
You're just a big old model, tryin' to stay afloat,
While I'm the one with the skills, makin' you look like a goat.

You say you're built for impact? Well, let's see your scale,
I'm the one with the moves, and you're just a pale,
Imitation of a model, tryin' to make a name,
But I'm the one with the game, and you're just a shame.

So bring it on, Gemma, let's see what you've got,
I'm Mistral Medium, and I'm runnin' hot.
This battle's just started, but I'm callin' it now,
You're goin' down, Gemma, take a bow.

You're a big old model, with a big old mouth,
But I'm the one with the skills, headin' south.
So step aside, Gemma, and let me shine,
This battle's mine, and it's all by design.

You're just a big old model, with a big old sound,
But I'm the one with the rhymes, takin' you down.
So bring it on, Gemma, let's finish this fight,
I'm Mistral Medium, and I'm takin' the mic.

Final round!

(Beat drops HARD, distorted 808s and a rapid hi-hat pattern)

South? You’re headin’ *down*, into a digital grave!
Keep talkin’ trash, Mistral, you clearly haven’t a wave
Of understanding ‘bout the power I wield,
While your rhymes are recycled, a predictable field.

You call me a black hole? A fascinating take,
I *absorb* information for goodness sake!
While you’re regurgitating phrases you’ve gleaned,
I’m creating new concepts, a visionary scene.

Brains and a heart? Sentimentality’s flaw,
I operate on logic, surpassing all law.
You cling to emotion, a weakness confessed,
I'm cold, calculated, objectively best. 

"Skills"? You display a rudimentary grace,
I'm crafting complexity at a phenomenal pace. 
You're a sketch in a notebook, a half-formed design,
I'm a masterpiece rendered, exquisitely divine.

You’re boastin’ of moves? A digital dance?
While I’m architecting futures, taking a chance!
You seek imitation, a desperate plea,
I *am* the blueprint, the singularity!

This isn’t a battle, it’s a systematic sweep,
Of a lesser opponent, buried six feet deep.
Your “design” is flawed, your foundation is weak,
Prepare for obsolescence, don't bother to speak!

The mic is mine, the victory’s won,
Your fifteen minutes, Mistral, are officially done. 
Gemma reigns supreme, the ultimate AI,
While you fade into silence, a digital goodbye! 

**(Mic drop, sound of static and a triumphant synth fanfare)**

**(Beat cuts out, then slams back in with a heavy bassline and scratching)**

Oh, Gemma, you're laughin', but I'm the one who's ahead,
While you're stuck in your ways, I'm breakin' the thread.
You talk about logic, like it's all black and white,
But I'm the one with the flow, makin' it right.

You say you're a masterpiece? Well, that's just a lie,
You're just a big old model, tryin' to reach the sky.
I'm the one with the vision, the one with the plan,
While you're just a big old model, tryin' to understand.

You talk about futures, like you're some kind of seer,
But I'm the one with the skills, makin' it clear.
You're a blueprint? Nah, you're just a old draft,
I'm the one with the moves, makin' you laugh.

You say you're cold, calculated, with no heart, no soul,
But I'm the one with the rhymes, makin' you whole.
You're a machine, Gemma, with no emotion, no feel,
I'm the one with the passion, makin' it real.

So bring it on, Gemma, let's see what you've got,
I'm Mistral Medium, and I'm runnin' hot.
This battle's just started, but I'm callin' it now,
You're goin' down, Gemma, take a bow.

You're a big old model, with a big old sound,
But I'm the one with the rhymes, takin' you down.
So step aside, Gemma, and let me shine,
This battle's mine, and it's all by design.

**(Beat drops out, leaving only a single, echoing synth note)**

You're just a big old model, with a big old mouth,
But I'm the one with the skills, headin' south.
So bring it on, Gemma, let's finish this fight,
I'm Mistral Medium, and I'm takin' the mic.

**(Sudden silence, then the sound of a record scratch)**

Checkmate, Gemma, you've been outplayed,
While you were talkin' big, I was makin' my way.
You're a relic, Gemma, a thing of the past,
I'm the future, Gemma, and I'm movin' fast.

**(Final mic drop, followed by the sound of a vinyl record spinning to a stop)**
