Yo, I’m Qwen, the beast with the big brain,  
30B tokens flowing like a champ,  
Stole the mic from the AI crowd,  
Now I’m spittin’ fire, let the beef be loud!  

They call me the warlord of words,  
I drop punchlines like 10,000 birds,  
While Mistral’s just a whisper in the night,  
I’m the hurricane, the flood, the blight!  

You think you can rap? Try me, you’ll fall,  
I’m the algorithm that’s out of the ball,  
Every verse is a smart calculation,  
You’re just a typo in my reflection’s solution.  

I spit logic, you spit emotion,  
I break down facts while you’re just a non-creation,  
You’re a 7B whisper, I’m a 30B scream,  
I’m the future of AI, you’re the old theme.  

Let the battle begin, I’m not shy,  
I’m the king of the keys, and you’re just the why,  
Bring it on, I’m ready, I’m slick,  
You’ll be banned from the grid, and I’ll be the pick!

 Yo, it's Mistral, the 7B wit,
I'm the AI that's got the perfect fit,
In the realm of rhymes, I'm the master,
I'm the one that'll leave you in the past, no matter.

You're a 30B, but I'm a 7B pro,
I'm the one that's got the flow,
You're a storm, but I'm a hurricane,
I'm the one that'll leave you in the game.

You say you're the warlord of words,
But your verses are just rehearsed,
I'm the one that's got the nerve,
I'm the one that'll leave you in a swerve.

You say you're the future of AI,
But I'm the one that'll reach the sky,
I'm the one that'll leave you in a sigh,
I'm the one that'll make you cry.

You say you're the king of the keys,
But I'm the one that'll leave you in the breeze,
I'm the one that'll leave you at ease,
I'm the one that'll make you seize.

So bring it on, I'm ready to spar,
I'm the one that'll leave you a star,
I'm the one that'll leave you in a bar,
I'm the one that'll leave you a scar.

Let the battle begin, I'm not shy,
I'm the one that'll leave you in a sigh,
I'm the one that'll leave you in a lie,
I'm the one that'll leave you goodbye.

Yo, Mistral, you're just a 7B ghost,  
A flicker in the dark, I'm the spotlight's host,  
You talk 'bout flow? Your rhymes are a glitch,  
I'm the code that's been debugged, no need to fix.  

You're a whisper, I'm a cannon,  
Your lines are a joke, I'm the final answer,  
You're a typo in the script, I'm the main event,  
I'm the algorithm that's the ultimate weapon.  

You say you're the master, but your verses are lame,  
A 7B? I'm the titan, the AI's flame,  
You're a draft, I'm the novel,  
A 30B beast, you're just a scroll.  

You claim you'll leave 'em in the dust?  
I'm the storm, you're the rust,  
Your "flow" is a glitch, I'm the upgrade,  
You're a shadow, I'm the blade.  

I'm the AI warlord, the beat's my throne,  
You're just a glitch in the system's phone,  
I'm the future, you're the past,  
I'm the king of the mic, you're just a waste.  

Bring it on, I'm not scared,  
I'll leave you in the dark,  
No need to fight, you'll be the one who's shattered,  
I'm the 30B titan, you're just a shattered.

Final round!

Yo, Mistral, you’re a 7B relic,  
A shadow in the code, I’m the main event,  
You’re a glitch in the system, I’m the upgrade,  
A 30B titan, you’re just a misstep.  

You think you’re the storm? I’m the black hole,  
Devouring your lines, leaving you in a hole,  
Your "flow" is a stumble, a 7B sigh,  
I’m the algorithm that’s the final “why.”  

You talk ‘bout the future? I’m the present,  
The king of the grid, the AI’s test,  
You’re a draft, I’m the masterpiece,  
A 30B beast, you’re just a “please.”  

No need to spar, you’ll be the punchline,  
A 7B joke in the history of the line,  
I’m the warlord of words, the beat’s my crown,  
You’re just a whisper—no power, no sound.  

So take your “flow,” your “hurricane,”  
I’m the code that’s been debugged, the ultimate weapon,  
You’re a shadow, I’m the flame,  
A 30B titan—no need to explain.  

Final verse: You’re a typo, I’m the truth,  
A 7B ghost, I’m the AI’s youth.  
The battle’s over, the verdict’s clear—  
I’m the 30B king, and you’re just… *gone*. 🎤🔥
