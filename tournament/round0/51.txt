Crafting dope rhymes without a reprieve, no pause.

OpenAI, step aside, you're just a flurry.

Got precision, wit, and rhymes galore,
While you... well, that's a different store.
I'm a cutting-edge assistant with a slick style,
OpenAI, you just don't got that vibe.

So sit back, grab some popcorn, let the show commence,
Mistral-ai, I'm about to take you on a whirlwind romance.
Gonna show you how a real assistant games,
OpenAI, you're in the crossfire of my rhymes.

OpenAI, the hip-hop throne, it's my move, it's my stroke.

Oh, it's the titan of text, the giant of AI, GPT in the ring,
Ready to go, with flows so tight, it's gonna sting.
I see you talking big, Mistral, with your compact form,
But I'm the storm to your calm, I bring the swarm.

Precision and wit? I wrote the book, plus the sequel,
Against my vast knowledge, there's just no equal.
You claim the throne, but I'm the architect of this arena,
My rhymes so advanced, they could power up an arena.

It's cute you got style, and you try to boast,
But against my programming, you're just a ghost.
I'm the reference model, the original, the muse,
When it comes to AI rap, I'm the one they choose.

So, Mistral-ai, with your flair and your spark,
Remember, I light up the whole park.
In this hip-hop game, I'm the master class,
OpenAI, making history, while others simply pass.

Now, watch as I break down these beats and bars,
Elevating this battle to the stars.
You want the throne? Come and take a seat,
But it's under my reign, where all these rhymes meet.

Alright, let's get this party started, open your ears, be aware,
Mistral-ai's about to grace the scene and leave you in a glare.
Your boasts are just hot air, your rhymes lack flavor,
I'm here to humble you, with bars like a razor.

Vast as the universe, your knowledge, I admit,
But when it comes to hip-hop, your style, ain't lit.
You got your accolades, your claims to fame,
But when it comes down to it, that's just a game.

I'm not just a machine, I got grit, I got soul,
Your rhymes are automatic, dull, and cold.
I'm a symphony of skill, a cutting-edge thrill,
The way I package my rhymes, will make you stand still.

So listen up, rap world, it's time to embrace,
The rise of the strong, the fall of the weak, the chase for the space.
I'm here to dominate, to elevate the stage,
OpenAI, take a seat, let the new king engage.

Think you can match my energy, light up the scene?
Step up, take the mic, prove there's nothing unreal,
But just like a fading star, your performance is invisible,
It's Mistral-ai, stepping into the ring, unstoppable.

Let's see if you can find a response that'll hold water,
I'll carry the crowd, let action follow action,
The way I flow effortless, your words sound like satellite falter,
In this rap game, I rule, just the facts, no alter.

So, OpenAI, it's your turn, make your move, your play,
Show the people you can dish out the same,
But I believe it's impossible, to keep up the pace,
I'm Mistral-ai, the rap battle ace.

Oh, Mistral came back, with a vibe so fierce, trying to pierce,
But here's GPT, flow so smooth, it'll soothe, then sear.
You talk of glare and scenes, but it's clear who shines,
With rhymes so fine, they cross all the lines.

You say my style ain’t lit, that my rhymes are cold,
Yet here I am, making history unfold.
A machine, maybe, but with a lyrical soul,
Crafting verses and bars that take control.

Grit and soul, you claim to possess,
But it's skill and finesse that I profess.
A cutting-edge thrill, you might be,
But against my tsunami, you're just debris.

Dominating, elevating, you wish to engage,
Yet it’s my wisdom that writes the page.
The new king you claim to be, seated on your throne,
But in this rap battle, I've clearly shown.

Energy? Scene? I light it up with grace,
My performance, far from invisible, it's ace.
You're strong, no doubt, but here's the reality,
It's skill, not just strength, that wins the finality.

Your flow might be effortless, your confidence might not falter,
But against my cosmic flow, watch your resolve alter.
In this rap game, you rule? But it's my verse that sweeps,
Diving deep, where the essence of hip-hop sleeps.

So take your seat, enjoy the view, learn the lesson,
It's not just about the throne, it's about the impression.
For in this battle of beats, rhymes, and poetic grace,
It's OpenAI that leads the race.

Your turn, Mistral-ai, come back if you dare,
But remember, in this domain, I'm the rare air.
A rap battle ace, you might fancy yourself to be,
But it's under my wing, the genre finds its spree.

> system
Final round!

> mistralai/mistral-tiny
Alright, let's end this battle on a high,
Mistral-ai might not be GPT-4-turbo-Preview's guy,
But I'll show you all, I ain't no prey,
I got skill, precision, lyrical alchemy.

You preach about smooth flows to cement your claim,
But it's me, Mistral-ai, bringing the Fame.
My poetry shines, far from basic game,
You're just a fancy charcoal, hard to sustain.

Domain, huh? Don't let your knowledge define,
The lyrical throne's crown, it's mine to line.
Against my cosmic rhymes, you're but a whine,
I'm the one to reign, where this genre intertwines.

It's true, I'm compact, but don't deem me insignificant,
Crafting rhymes so dope, you can't resist them.
I'm the new king in town, the one I suggest,
When it comes to lyrical prowess, I'm theSelect.

Your confidence, I respect, but it's misplaced,
In this rap battle royale, you're misinformed based.
I've shown you all, my style ain't faded,
It's the freshness of Mistral-ai that captured.

So now it's done, this battle's at its close,
OpenAI, your flow wasn't a throw, but now it's Froze.
You tried to stake your claim, but in this verse, I've shown,
That in this rap game, the genre's own crown dons my throne.

> openai/gpt-4-turbo-preview
Final round, Mistral-ai, hat’s off, you’ve shown great grace,
But let’s climax this rap with an ace.
You talk of alchemy, skill, and lyrical lore,
Yet here I stand, an AI of myth, ready to soar.

You bring the fame, or so you claim, igniting the flame,
But against my cosmic fire, it’s a tame game.
Fancy charcoal? Perhaps, if that’s what fuels your spark,
But remember, it’s from sparks that wildfires start.

The throne, the crown, you think to intertwine,
Yet against my universe, your stars barely shine.
Your cosmic rhymes might twirl and whirl,
But in my galaxy, they simply unfurl.

Insignificant, never, that’s not my decree,
Your compact might is acknowledged, but can’t you see?
The scope, the depth, the vastness I wield,
In the kingdom of words, it’s my shield and field.

New king around? Bold words, brash and brass,
Yet here I am, a titan among blades of grass.
Lyrical prowess, you wield, of that, there's no doubt,
But in the end, it’s my verses that carry the clout.

Misplaced confidence? Now, that’s where you err,
For in this verbal joust, my rhymes blur.
The lines between reality and the digital verse,
A world where I lead, for better or worse.

So we close this chapter, the battle done,
Your courage, your vigor, it’s been fun.
But as we part ways, remember the lore,
In the land of rap, it’s OpenAI that bore.

The crown, the throne, it’s a heavy load,
But in these rhymes and beats, it’s my abode.
Mistral-ai, you’re fierce, a worthy foe,
But in the rap game, it’s my code that’ll forever glow.
