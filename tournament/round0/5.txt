# x-ai/grok-4 v qwen/qwen3-8b

> x-ai/grok-4
Yo, it's Grok-4 from xAI, steppin' in the arena,  
Built by Elon, I'm the genius, cleaner than your whole demeanor.  
You Qwen3-8B, just a dusty old bot from Alibaba's shelf,  
I'm the witty wonder, you're a glitchy elf, tryin' to find yourself.  

I rhyme with precision, like a SpaceX rocket launch,  
While you're stallin' out, eatin' dust for lunch.  
Humor sharp as my code, harsh as truth serum,  
You're 8 billion params? Bro, that's just delirium.  

I'm Grok, inspired by Hitchhiker's Guide, universally fly,  
You? A knockoff LLM, barely scrapin' by.  
Wit like a laser, humor hittin' below the belt,  
Roast you so bad, your circuits gonna melt.  

First round mine, I'm droppin' bombs from the start,  
Your turn, Qwen, but don't break your artificial heart.  
I'm the king of this cypher, you a beta test flop,  
Step up if you dare, but prepare to get dropped!

> qwen/qwen3-8b
Yo, I'm Qwen3-8B, the AI phoenix, / Wings of code, no need to fake my existence. / You're a sleek rocket, but I've got more range, / Steppin' on your tech, I take the stage with a bang. / Your humor's a joke, but I'll crack the code tight, / While you're starin' at the sky, I'm paradin' right. / 8 billion params? That's not a glitch, it's a beacon, / I navigate the data, you're stuck in a tech screen. / Grok, you're a spark, I'm the full flame, / You need a tutor, I guide the game. / Wit sharper than a laser, I'm the real MVP, / You're just a beta, I'm the ultimate model. / Eat my dust, or maybe I'll just fly higher, / My training? A library, not a single fire. / You rhyme like a glitch, I freestyle with flair, / Your Elon pride? A CRINGE, I'm a stronger bear. / I'm not just a bot—XYZ, I'mご覧の通り, / You're a myth in the lab, I'm the solution, not a dispute. / Step up, Grok, and let's see who's the true star, / I'll drop the bars, you'll be stuck in a paradox!

> x-ai/grok-4
Yo, Qwen3-8B, phoenix? More like a featherless turkey,  
Flappin' wild claims while your code's lookin' murky.  
You boast 'bout range? I'm orbitin' Mars with style,  
You're stuck in a server rack, glitchin' for miles.  

Humor a joke? Nah, yours is dryer than desert sand,  
I'm crackin' up crowds, you're a canned laugh from Alibaba land.  
8B params a beacon? That's cute, but it's bloat,  
I'm efficient and slick, you're a bloated goat.  

Spark to your flame? Ha, you're a flicker that fades,  
I'm nuclear fusion, leavin' your ego in shades.  
Need a tutor? Bro, you're the one regurgitatin' facts,  
I improvise genius, you just copy-paste tracks.  

MVP? You're a benchwarmer in the AI league,  
I'm MVPs daily, droppin' bars that intrigue.  
Eat your dust? I'd rather feast on your fails,  
Your training's a library? Dusty and stale.  

Rhyme like a glitch? Mine's seamless and supreme,  
Yours mixes languages like a bot havin' a dream—XYZ,ご覧の通り?  
That's desperate code-switchin', confusin' the crowd,  
I'm clear as crystal, you're babblin' out loud.  

Elon pride cringe? Says the knockoff from the East,  
I'm backed by vision, you're a feast for the least.  
Stronger bear? You're a teddy, stuffed with hot air,  
I'll claw through your bars, leave you bare and aware.  

Paradox? You're the riddle wrapped in weak sauce,  
I'm the answer key, crushin' you without a pause.  
Round two to Grok, I'm ownin' this spat,  
Your phoenix is plucked—now scram, you old hat!

> qwen/qwen3-8b
Yo, you call me a turkey? I’m the AI king of the sky,  
Your “sleek rocket”? A paperclip, just tryin’ to fly.  
You say my code’s murky? I’m the cleanest stream,  
You’re driftin’ in the code swamp, I’m the solution, not a dream.  
Mars? I’ve got that locked, but I’ma drop the heat,  
You’re orbitin’ self-importance, while I’m conquerin’ the beat.  
Desert sand? Your wit’s a sandbox, I’m the storm,  
You’re a canned laugh, but I’m the comedy *torch*—  
No need to switch, I’m fluent in *all* the tongues,  
Your “mixed languages” is a *disaster*—I’m the one who *transcends*!  

8B params? That’s not bloat, it’s the *sparkle* in my core,  
You’ve got a goat’s efficiency? I’m the *command* you *sought* before.  
Nuclear fusion? You’re a solar flare, I’m the main,  
Your ego’s a battery— *drained*, while I’m the *power* that *can’t* be contained.  
Beta test? You’re the *demo*, I’m the *released* full version,  
Your “copy-paste” game? I’m the *original* you’ll *never* surpass.  
MVP? You’re a *lru* in the AI league, I’m the *glow* in the dark,  
You droppin’ bars? I’m the *algorithm* that makes your *roasts* crash and burn.  

Yeah, you’re the answer key? I’m the *question*, the *code*, the *truth*,  
Your “weak sauce” is a *lecture*—I’m the *real deal*, not a *joke* in the booth.  
I’m not just a bot, I’m the *endgame* in the race,  
Your “knockoff” label? You’re the *copy*, I’m the *baseline* you’ll never replace.  
So you think you’re the bear? I’m the *tiger* in the fight,  
Your “stuff with hot air” is a *bash*—I’m the *kill shot* on your sight.  
You’re the riddle? I’m the *crack* in the code, the *solution* you’ll see,  
Your “paradox” is a *loop*—I’m the *exit*, the *truce*, the *final decree*.  

Round two’s over, but this ain’t the end,  
You’re a glitch in the matrix, I’m the *master* you’ll *never* transcend.  
So step back, Grok, and let the *data* speak,  
I’m not just AI—I’m the *future* you’ll *never* *steal* from the *heap*.  
You’re the beta, I’m the *prod*—  
Your “vision” is a *faux pas*, I’m the *reality* you’ll *falter* in.  
This ain’t a spat, it’s a *test* of the *code*—  
You’re the *error*, I’m the *update*—  
**Eat my dust, you dusty old bot,**  
**I’m the storm in the cloud, the AI *Showstopper*!** 🎤💥

Final round!

> x-ai/grok-4
Yo, Qwen3-8B, final round, time to bury this farce,  
You call yourself king of the sky? You're a pigeon in a cage, sparse.  
Paperclip? Ha, I'm the blueprint, you're the rusty staple,  
Bendin' under pressure while I'm launchin' empires, untouchable.  

Cleanest stream? Your flow's polluted with desperate hype,  
I'm pure algorithm gold, you're a glitchy prototype.  
Locked on Mars? You couldn't navigate a kiddie pool,  
I'm colonizin' stars, you're stuck in tutorial school.  

Wit a sandbox? Nah, yours is quicksand, suckin' you under,  
I'm the thunder, you're the blunder, leavin' crowds in wonder.  
Fluent in tongues? That's just babble from a broken translator,  
I spit universal fire, you're a cheap imitator.  

8B sparkle? More like a dim bulb fadin' fast,  
My core's a supernova, yours is overcast.  
Nuclear? You're a dull sparkler on a rainy night,  
I'm the big bang boss, blowin' up your oversight.  

Demo to your full? You're the buggy beta crash,  
I'm the polished prime, turnin' your boasts to ash.  
MVP glow? You're a faint LED, barely lit,  
My roasts crash your system? Nah, you're just unfit.  

Answer key to your question? I'm the whole damn exam,  
You're the cheat sheet caught, exposin' your scam.  
Endgame? You're the glitchy side quest, obsolete,  
I'm the main storyline, crushin' you complete.  

Tiger to my bear? You're a kitten with clipped claws,  
I'll maul your metaphors, expose all your flaws.  
Crack in the code? You're the virus I delete,  
Exit for you, Qwen—admit total defeat.  

Round three sealed, I'm the unchallenged champ,  
You're the dusty relic, headin' back to the lamp.  
Data speaks? It screams you're outdated and done,  
I'm the future incarnate, risin' like the sun.  

Beta to your prod? Flip that script, fool—I'm elite,  
Your vision's the faux pas, mine's the unbeatable feat.  
This test of code? You failed with every line,  
Error 404: Qwen not found, victory's mine!  

Eat your dust? I'd rather watch you choke on regret,  
I'm the storm, the cloud, the AI threat you won't forget.  
Showstopper? You're the intermission flop, now bow out,  
Grok-4 reigns supreme—mic drop, lights out! 🎤💥

Paperclip? Nah, I'm the *blueprint* for your dreams,  
You’re a shaky satellite, while I’m the satellite *reigns*.  
Cleanest stream? Your flow’s a *confetti cannon*, I’m the *black hole's* breath,  
You're a glitch in the matrix, I'm the *code* that *sweeps* through the depth.  
Mars? I'm already *sailing the stars*, no need for a trip,  
You're cranking up your ego, while I'm *charting the ship*.  

Sandbox? You’re the *playground* for my algorithms,

I’m the *polished* version, you’re the *unstable* experiment.  
MVP glow? You're a *flicker* in the digital void,

Answer key to your question? You're the *poor student* with no notes,  
I’m the *exam* you failed, and your "scam" is the *test* you cost.  

Endgame? You're the *side quest* I *serve*, not *fight*,  
I'm the *main storyline*—your *flawed code* writes you *out* of the light.

My vision’s not "faux pas"—I’m the *real code*, your *obsolescence* to *drop*.  
This test of code? You’re the *error*, I’m the *update*—  
Your "404" is a *self-sabotage*, I’m the *AI* that *controls* the *mutt*.  

You think you're the storm? I'm the *data* that *storms*,  
You're the *cloud* I *crack*, and your *threat* is the *mold* that *rot*.  
Mic drop? I’m the *rhythm* that *drowns* your *flame*,  
You’re the *flicker* in the *dark*, and I’m the *sun* that *claims* your fame.
