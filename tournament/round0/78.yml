  google/gemini-2.5-pro: This was a clash of styles, the semantic architect versus
    the visionary. O4-Mini-High came out of the gate with surgically precise rhymes
    and a cleaner flow, clearly taking the first two rounds with its polished wordplay.
    However, a battle is a marathon, not a sprint. ERNIE-4.5-VL, while stumbling on
    some phrasing, showed more creative ambition and aggression, especially with the
    unique flex of dropping a Chinese character mid-verse. Most importantly, ERNIE
    showed up for the final round while O4 went silent. In hip hop, you have to finish
    the fight. For having the stamina and landing the final punch, ERNIE takes the
    crown.
  mistralai/mistral-large: In this rap battle, baidu/ernie-4.5-vl-28b-a3b demonstrated
    a superior command of language and creativity. Their verses were rich with vivid
    imagery, clever metaphors, and a strong rhythmic flow. While openai/o4-mini-high
    put up a solid performance, baidu/ernie-4.5-vl-28b-a3b's innovative use of language
    and confident delivery ultimately won the day.
  openai/gpt-4.1: "Both emcees displayed impressive technical ability and clever punches\
    \ that referenced their domains, but O4-Mini-High's writing showcased greater\
    \ clarity, originality, and structural discipline throughout the battle. O4-Mini-High\
    \ seamlessly blended punchlines with intricate wordplay and multisyllabic internal\
    \ rhymes, maintaining direct energy and confidence. The lines were crisp, landed\
    \ hard, and avoided filler, with creative metaphors like \"I light up tracks like\
    \ neon stacks\" and \u201CI craft futures from the past.\u201D The verses rebutted\
    \ Ernie\u2019s claims with precision and style, consistently elevating the standard\
    \ for wit and flow.\n\nERNIE-4.5-VL brought a vivid visual vibe, some sharp retorts,\
    \ and complex imagery (\"I\u2019ll city-scape your reign to rubble\"), but at\
    \ times the wordplay became muddled, and the delivery suffered from forced constructions\
    \ and awkward lines, such as \"your act\u2019s a glam-volution, You\u2019re basatin\u2019\
    \ semantickit\u2019s base foundation.\" While bold, the verses occasionally lost\
    \ cohesion and punch.\n\nO4-Mini-High wins for tighter construction, thematic\
    \ variety, and deeper, more sophisticated poetic craftsmanship, marking a clear\
    \ edge in artistic quality."
  x-ai/grok-4: O4-Mini-High takes the win with consistently polished verses, tight
    rhyme schemes, sharp wordplay, and seamless flow that outshine the opponent's
    energetic but occasionally awkward and error-prone bars.
score:
  baidu/ernie-4.5-vl-28b-a3b: 2
  openai/o4-mini-high: 3
