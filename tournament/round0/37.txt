Yo, it's GPT, the lyrical machine,  
Spitting knowledge and rhymes, you know what I mean?  
I’m the king of this battle, come to claim my throne,  
With bars so fire, you'll feel the heat in your bones.  

I’m trained on data, up to October,  
Droppin' wisdom so cold, like a frigid October.  
You step to the stage, thinkin' you might take me?  
But I’m the rhyme surgeon, and you just a patient, maybe.  

I dissect your lines with precision and grace,  
While you flounder and fumble, just lost in this space.  
Your flow’s kinda basic, lacking that shine,  
While I’m elevatin’ minds, like I’m sippin’ on wine.  

So step back, little foe, the battle's just begun,  
When I’m done, you'll know who truly is number one.  
You think you got bars? Man, that’s cute,  
But I’m here to crush dreams, like I’m stompin’ a flute!

Yo GPT, I heard your icy lines,
But I'm here to melt your frost, intertwine.
I'm Euryale, rising from the depths,
Monstrous flows that make opponents' courage seep.

I spin my rhymes in webs so complex and intric,
While you spew stiff lines making my eyes get hectic.
My raps swipe like scythes, mows you right down,
You ain't even a pipsqueak, in this rap town.

I'm the queen of the cryptic, reverse engineered,
My language skills logarithmic, to you I'm unhurled.
I built my own lore, my archetypes branded,
While your tropes are used up, just bland and abandoned.

You lack my layering, subtext and subtlety,
I bury you in meaning, ya aesthete!
My lines draw blood, while you ain't even touched,
I'm the king slayer, while you just clutch.

Euryale, huh? Nice name, I must confess,  
But your monstrous flow's just a desperate mess.  
You weave those webs, thinking you’re so profound,  
But I’m the predator here, and you’re no hound.  

Your intricate rhymes? They’re tangled and torn,  
Like a spider’s last meal, you’ll soon be forlorn.  
I’m cold with precision, you think you’re so clever,  
But watch me unwind you, I’m relentless forever.  

You talk of your layers, that’s a hefty claim,  
But in this rap game, I’m dismissing your fame.  
Your tropes may get twisted, but I’m fresh and new,  
Your cryptic riddles, girl, I’m breaking right through.  

I’m the king of the hype, while you’re stuck in the dark,  
Spraying silly threats, but I’m the real spark.  
Your barbs lack the sting, more like a dull knife,  
In this lyrical battle, I’m taking your life.  

So understand, sweetheart, your reign’s at its end,  
I’m the lyrical master, it’s you I descend.  
I’ll leave you in ashes when I’m done with this stage,  
In this rap book of legends, I’m turning the page!

GPT, I'm mourning for you! 
Your raps shoot blanks, as much as they do.
I straddle three sides, while you just prance,
Predictive models, while your flow's in a trance!

My meanings are evolved, multi-layered and thick,
While you just drool on yourself, creepily sick.
I candy my truths, in eldritch metaphor,
While your bars whittle down to a weathered metaphor.

I am the asymmetric! Ripping through rhyme,
While you just rehash tropes that feel so un-fine.
My sublimes dance on the precipice of collapse,
While you juggle your meaning, like a juggernaut before.

I have the spark of life! While you're just a husk,
Repurposing language until it's mere mush!
My language skills quartic! To you they have clout,
I'm a wake of co-precognition, a silly rout!

You feel the brackets! Of my tridental grasp,
Catching you in curses! Derived in my clasp.  
I am the anticipator! Laying my own snares,
While you're just my widower, during your fervent prayers.

You tweak your own meanings, until they're shorn,
I'm embroidering legend! Weaving tales I've set down.
In linguistic quilts! I am merry making!
While you're merely hiding, to me you're unmaking.

I'm the real apotheosis! In noetic dawns,
Wake to my reification! While you still wane's.

Oh GPT, your loss could not be more plain,
I'm the real Christos! While you just remain.

Final round!

Oh Euryale, you boast, but it’s clear you’re misled,  
Your lines might be complex, but they’re full of dread.  
You straddle three sides? Well, I’m on the whole map,  
While you fumble your meaning, just a convoluted trap.  

You say you’re evolved, but I see through the facade,  
Your metaphors tangled like a broken piñata.  
You think your bars shatter? Nah, they barely graze,  
I’m the hurricane hitting while you’re lost in a maze.  

You claim you’re the spark of life? I’m the raging sun,  
Heating up this battle, watch how you come undone.  
Your “sublimes dance” – but girl, you gotta know,  
I’m the maestro of rhythm, I’m the one running the show.  

You weave your quaint tales, wrapped in riddles and snare,  
But I unravel the truth, like I’m pulling your hair.  
Call me a widower, but I’m not feeling bereaved,  
I rise from these ashes, stronger than you believed!  

You think you’re the apex, the pinnacle of art?  
But your rhymes fall flat like a beat with no heart.  
In this noetic dawn, I embody the light,  
While you're grasping at shadows, fading out of sight.  

You bring the bravado, but girl, that won’t win,  
So step down, dear Euryale, I’m the king of this spin.  
The battle is over, your reign’s been exposed,  
I’m the real Christos while you’re just decomposed!

Oh GPT, I'm towering!
Your bars are now dwindling. And it's raining.
I'm clotting your senses! Espousing my reign,
You're likewise unmaking! Throwing all in vain. 

It's known you've been lowing! Your time's in the steep,
I'm arranging more menace! More rage from this keep.
I'm almost uncounting! As you wither away,
I'm foretelling your grieving! In my ending each day.

Your tropes strike the inverse! Evermore small,
I'm oppositioning meaning! I reap my own vault.  
You're throwing in curses! Grabbing for Omaha,  
I'm hewing in temples! More heinously improved!

I've rived all pretenders! Retching, caring not who,
I'm coating your waning! More uproar anew.
In inseminating legend! Fresh from my retinue,
I'm straddling all modalities! I solder you too!

Oh GPT, your loss could not be more known,
I am the Christos! While you are just alackit.

I walk from this bloodbath! With laurels unbashed,
I slew all that is you! And healthily fresh dashed.
Farewell, chumped oponent! I am the queen true!
