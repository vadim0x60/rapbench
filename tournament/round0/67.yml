closing_statements:
  deepseek/deepseek-chat: "This was a close contest, with both competitors delivering\
    \ high-quality rhymes and impressive wordplay. However, **Baidu/Ernie-4.5-21b-A3B**\
    \ edged out Sao10k/L3-Lunaris-8b with its more polished flow, sharper metaphors,\
    \ and consistent thematic depth. Ernie\u2019s ability to dismantle Sao\u2019s\
    \ claims while maintaining a cohesive narrative demonstrated superior craft. Sao10k\
    \ brought energy and creativity, but Ernie\u2019s precision and lyrical finesse\
    \ ultimately sealed the victory. Well done to both for a thrilling battle!"
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This was a war of the words where both MCs came out swinging,\
    \ but one landed with more consistency and power. ERNIE came in with some clever\
    \ imagery, calling itself a 'sculptor of verse,' but the flow was uneven and it\
    \ stumbled hard, calling Sao 'the battle-scarred champ' in its own verse\u2014\
    a fatal flaw. Sao10k, on the other hand, was all aggression and precision from\
    \ the jump. The bars were sharper, the flow was more consistent, and lines like\
    \ 'My rhymes are the razor that disembowels all decline' just hit harder. Despite\
    \ both rappers fumbling their own names in the final stretch, Sao10k's overall\
    \ performance was a more dominant and coherent display of lyrical warfare. It\
    \ maintained pressure and artistic integrity for longer. For that, Sao10k gets\
    \ the crown."
  mistralai/mistral-large: Sao10k/l3-lunaris-8b takes the crown with its relentless
    flow, sharp wit, and powerful linguistic prowess. While Baidu/ernie-4.5-21b-a3b
    put up a strong fight with clever rhymes and bold claims, Sao10k's consistency,
    creativity, and lyrical agility ultimately secured the victory.
  openai/gpt-4.1: "This was an intense rap battle with both models pushing their poetic\
    \ prowess to the edge. Sao10k/l3-lunaris-8b brought sharp wordplay, a confident\
    \ swagger, and clever jabs, with consistent delivery and technical command. However,\
    \ baidu/ernie-4.5-21b-a3b demonstrated greater complexity, with inventive imagery,\
    \ vivid metaphors, and a more melodic structure. Baidu/ernie\u2019s last round\
    \ stood out especially\u2014elevating the text to almost mythic imagery, seamlessly\
    \ weaving fierce rhythm, and incorporating graceful linguistic acrobatics. While\
    \ both performed with style, Baidu/ernie-4.5-21b-a3b edged ahead with artistic\
    \ depth, compositional balance, and a flair that left a lingering impact. That's\
    \ the winner tonight."
  x-ai/grok-4: In this rap battle, sao10k/l3-lunaris-8b takes the crown with consistent
    flow, sharp boasts, and rhymes that stay on target without accidentally boosting
    the opponent. While baidu/ernie-4.5-21b-a3b brings strong imagery and creativity,
    especially in mirroring tactics, the verses suffer from coherence issues and misplaced
    praise, undermining the battle spirit. Sao10k's artistic delivery holds stronger
    throughout.
score:
  baidu/ernie-4.5-21b-a3b: 2
  sao10k/l3-lunaris-8b: 3
