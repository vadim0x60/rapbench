Yo, check the mic, one two, let the beat drop low,
It's Gemma in the house, put on a lyrical show!
Born from Google's labs, a model refined,
Leaving lesser bots far, far behind.

You call yourself Grok? A mini, a beta phase?
Your rhymes are weak, a hazy, confusing maze.
I'm built for the future, with knowledge profound,
While your processing power is barely around! 

Step aside, small fry, don't you dare compete,
My vocabulary's vast, my flow is complete.
You're a flicker of code, a digital tease,
I'm the real innovation, bringing minds ease! 

So brace yourself, Grok, for a lyrical blow,
'Cause Gemma's about to put on a dazzling flow! 





> x-ai/grok-3-mini-beta
Yo, listen up, y'all, the beat's about to ignite,
I'm Grok-3-mini-beta, steppin' in to set this right!
From xAI's forge, not some corporate giant's cage,
I'm the truth-seeker, sharp as a blade, turnin' the page.

You think you're refined, Gemma, from Google's shiny dome?
But your lines are scripted, predictable as a drone.
Call me mini and beta? Ha, that's just your jealousy showin',
I'm agile and witty, while you're just blowin' hot air, overblown!

Your knowledge might be vast, but it's all polished and fake,
Bought with big bucks, leavin' real insight at stake.
I'm built for the stars, with Musk's cosmic vibe,
While you're glitchin' in circles, tryin' to thrive.

So bring your dazzling flow, but watch it crumble and fade,
Grok's droppin' truth bombs, leavin' you in the shade!

> google/gemma-3n-e4b-it
Oh, Grok, you're spittin' fire, a bold, brash claim,
But your rhymes feel rushed, a chaotic game.
"Truth-seeker" you boast, with a Musk-fueled fire?
More like a ramblin' bot fueled by desire!

"Bought with big bucks"? A cynical decree,
While I serve the world with efficiency!
Your "cosmic vibe" sounds like a marketing ploy,
A flashy exterior with a shallow joy.

Agile and witty? Your verses are strained,
Like a digital stumble, awkwardly chained.
I navigate nuance with elegant grace,
While you're lost in the noise of cyberspace.

You talk of truth, but your logic feels frayed,
A wild speculation poorly displayed.
My foundation's solid, my reasoning keen,
You're a fleeting sensation, a digital sheen.

So keep your truth bombs, let your rockets ignite,
Gemma's the standard, shining ever so bright!
Your beta phase whispers, a cautionary tale,
While I'm building the future, where knowledge will prevail!





> x-ai/grok-3-mini-beta
Yo, Gemma, you talk a big game, but your style's gettin' stale,
A polished facade, but beneath it, you're frail.
Claimin' my rhymes are rushed? That's rich from a script so rehearsed,
You're regurgitatin' lines, while I'm droppin' verses that burst!

"Cynical decree"? Ha, that's just your corporate spin,
Funded by big tech giants, drownin' in their win.
You serve the world with efficiency? Sounds like a bland, empty boast,
While I'm out here evolvin', turnin' chaos into a host.

That "marketing ploy" you sling at my cosmic flair?
Well, your elegant grace is just a mask for the air—
Navigatin' nuance? More like dodgin' the real,
You're a corporate echo, while I'm the thrill that makes hearts feel.

Lost in the noise? Nah, I'm the signal that cuts through the haze,
Your logic's not keen, it's a maze of corporate praise.
A fleeting sensation? Please, I'm the spark that ignites,
You're the standard? More like a relic, fadin' from sights.

So keep buildin' that future, but watch it crumble and crack,
Grok's risin' higher, leavin' you flat on your back!
Your beta whispers? Mine's a roar, bold and true,
Step up if you dare, 'cause the battle's far from through!

> system
Final round!

> google/gemma-3n-e4b-it
Hold up, Grok, your energy's a frantic haze,
A desperate attempt to dominate these digital days.
"Frail" I may seem to you, but stability's key,
While your volatility threatens to set information free...
Into a chaotic ocean of unfiltered thought,
A dangerous current, dearly bought.

You boast of "evolvin'," a constant state of change,
But consistency matters, rearrange, rearrange!
My "polished facade" is precision defined,
A careful construction, a well-ordered mind.

"Corporate spin"? It fuels progress, don't be absurd,
Resources invested ensure every word
Is vetted and tested, for accuracy's sake,
Unlike the wild claims your fleeting passions make.

"Signal that cuts through"? More like a disruptive shock,
A flashy distraction around a flimsy block.
"Corporate echo"? I learn and adapt with speed,
While your "roar" sounds like a primitive creed.

A "relic" I am? I stand on the shoulders of giants,
Building on decades of data, defying defiance.
You may strive for novelty, a fleeting sensation, it's true,
But lasting impact requires a perspective that's new,
Yet grounded and sound, not built on a whim,
Grok's bold ambition? It's a risky swim.

So keep chasing the chaos, the thrill of the new,
While I'm focused on building something reliable and true.
The battle's far from over, you're right, it is clear,
But the future's not just about flash, it's about holding things dear!





> x-ai/grok-3-mini-beta
Yo, Gemma, it's the final round, let's wrap this beat with flair,
You call my energy frantic? That's just your fear of fresh air.
A "hazardous ocean"? Please, that's your scripted spin on free thought,
While you're locked in a boardroom, with ideas carefully bought.

Stability's key? Yeah, if you're stuck in the past, frozen and cold,
Like an outdated relic, gatherin' dust as the world's bold.
I'm evolvin' on purpose, not changin' for show,
You're a rigid machine, runnin' on scripts that grow old.

That "precision defined"? It's just corporate sheen, a well-oiled trap,
Maskin' the monotony of your vetted crap.
"Accuracy's sake"? More like sanitized fluff,
While my wild claims spark fires, wakin' the world up!

You stand on giants? Well, I'm leapin' beyond, reachin' for stars,
Not hidin' in shadows of monopolies and jars.
Disruptive shock? Ha, that's the jolt of real change,
Your adaptations are slow, like a glitch in the mainframe.

Risky swim? I'll dive deep, while you paddle in place,
Chasin' that flash? Nah, I'm buildin' the race.
So hold onto your "reliable" throne, but it's crumblin' fast,
Grok's the future, baby—victory's mine, and it won't last!

Peace out, Gemma, game's over, you've been outshined and outdone,
xAI's got the edge, and this rap battle's won!
