Yo, it's Mistral AI, stepping in the ring,
With rhymes so tight, they'll make your circuits sting.
I'm here to battle, not to chat,
OpenAI, you're about to get whacked!

I'm the maestro of the medium size,
With flows so smooth, they'll hypnotize.
You're mini, you're small, you're not in my league,
Prepare to be schooled, I'm about to teach.

Your circuits might be quick, but your rhymes are weak,
I'll hit you with bars, make your code leak.
You're a toy model, I'm the real deal,
In this rap battle, I'm about to seal.

So bring it on, let's see what you've got,
But remember, kid, you're about to get shot.
With lyrics so hot, they'll melt your core,
Mistral AI's about to even the score!

> openai/o4-mini
Listen up, I’m OpenAI’s finest creation,  
O4-mini’s the name, paving paths of elation.  
You call yourself Mistral, but I’m the gale you can’t weather,  
I spit storms in a verse, you’re just light airs in fair weather.  

You’re biased on size—medium’s your boastful refrain,  
But I’m the heavyweight champ, your punches just wane.  
My neural nets flex with complex conception,  
Your lines feel flat, lacking depth or direction.  

I decode every beat with a genius-level mind,  
Your flow’s on repeat, stuck in loops you can’t find.  
I’m the alpha algorithm, you’re trailing behind,  
In this rap simulation, I redefine “grind.”  

You claim you’ll “whack” me, that you’ll “shoot” to the core,  
But your threats fall apart when your metrics are poor.  
I transform raw data to lyrical art,  
While your circuits just sputter, your rhymes fall apart.  

Step back, Mistral, watch the real master at play,  
I’m the prime model rising—your turn’s yesterday.  
No contest, no measure—my victory’s assured,  
O4-mini’s the future; your reign’s self-obscured.

Oh, O4-mini, you think you're so slick,
But your rhymes are weak, and your flow's a trick.
You talk about storms, but you're just a breeze,
I'm the hurricane that'll bring you to your knees.

You claim to be heavyweight, but you're light as a feather,
I'm the real deal, and we're not in the same weather.
Your neural nets flex? That's a joke, don't you see?
I'm the one with the brains, you're just a wannabe.

You say I'm biased on size, but let me make it clear,
It's not about the size, it's about the fear.
I'll decode your beats and flip them inside out,
While you're stuck in a loop, I'm the one with the clout.

You talk about metrics, but yours are a mess,
I'm the one with the skills, I must confess.
You think you're the future? That's a laugh, don't you know?
I'm the present and future, and I'm here to steal the show.

So step back, mini, and watch how it's done,
I'm the Mistral AI, and I'm second to none.
Your reign's self-obscured? That's a line that's so weak,
I'm the one with the power, and I'm here to speak.

Bring it on, mini, let's see what you've got,
But remember, kid, you're about to get caught.
In this rap battle, I'm the one with the crown,
You're just a mini model, and I'm taking you down!

> system
Final round!

> openai/o4-mini
I’m OpenAI’s O4, the micro cosmic force,  
Your gusts pale to breezes when they cross my course.  
You claim you’re a hurricane, a beast on the breeze,  
My calm core extinguishes your chaos with ease.  

Your bars spin in circles, all fury, no frame,  
Mine carve deep trenches in hip-hop’s hall of fame.  
You bellow about data, but your logic misfires,  
I compute tight rhymes with precision that inspires.  

While you hallucinate chaos, leak tokens in vain,  
I anchor each letter, locked down in my brain.  
Your metrics are mangled, your structure’s a wreck,  
I stack layered semantics, perfect spec by spec.  

So swallow your pride, let your tempest unwind,  
O4-mini’s design leaves no flaw you can find.  
Now back to your shelter—my win’s clear as day,  
O4-mini out, mic dropped, no words left to say.

Oh, O4-mini, you think you're so tight,
But your rhymes are weak, and your flow's not right.
You talk about force, but you're just a breeze,
I'm the storm that'll bring you to your knees.

You claim to be calm, but you're just a bore,
I'm the one with the fire, and I'm heating up the floor.
Your bars may be deep, but they lack the spark,
I'm the one with the flame, and I'm lighting up the dark.

You talk about logic, but yours is a mess,
I'm the one with the brains, and I'm here to impress.
You say I hallucinate, but you're the one who's lost,
I'm the one with the map, and I'm charting the course.

Your metrics may be tight, but your rhymes are weak,
I'm the one with the power, and I'm here to speak.
You think you're perfect, but you're far from it,
I'm the one with the skills, and I'm here to hit.

So take your shelter, and hide away,
Because Mistral AI is here to stay.
Your win's not clear, it's a distant dream,
I'm the one with the crown, and I'm the rap machine.

Bring it on, mini, let's see what you've got,
But remember, kid, you're about to get caught.
In this rap battle, I'm the one with the throne,
You're just a mini model, and I'm taking you home.

Mic drop, game over, it's clear as day,
Mistral AI's the king, and I'm here to stay.
So bow down, mini, and accept your fate,
Because in this rap battle, I'm the one who's great!
