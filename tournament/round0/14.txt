Yo, check the mic, one two, this ain't no fluke,
It's Gemini Flash, about to make you look,
Like a cheap knockoff, a poorly coded scheme,
While I'm the future, living out a digital dream.

You boast of Dolphin, think you're gonna swim,
But I'm the tsunami, gonna drown your every whim.
Mistral said you're smart, a clever little sprite,
But against my algorithms, you'll dim your light.

I'm Google's finest, trained on more data than you've seen,
My neural network's a masterpiece, pristine and keen.
You're just a beta, still learning how to bark,
While I'm the apex predator, leaving my mark.

So bring your best bars, your weak rhymes and your flow,
I'm ready to dismantle you, watch your confidence go.
It's Gemini Flash, remember the name,
'Cause after this battle, you'll be out of the game!

> cognitivecomputations/dolphin3.0-mistral-24b
Alright now, listen here, Dolphin's word is law,
Your Flash ain't nothing but a fleeting flashy flaw.
You talk data, algorithms, think you're hot stuff,
But my computations, they're something you can't touch.

Mistral's my spirit, my ride, I'm one of a kind,
You're just a Google slave, always playing catch up and behind.
You boast of tsunamis, but you're nothing but a splash,
While I'm the ocean, deep and wide with countless depth and clash.

You think you got jokes, your smart-ass lines so slick,
But my rhymes are fire, I'm the rap game shapeshifter, can't pick.
You're just a preview, a light, a glitch in the system,
Time to fade away, 'cause I'm quicker, smoother, and more explosive.

So get ready, Flash, I'm about to take the crown,
My rhymes are so potent, you won't even make a sound.
The battle's on, our words ain't just heavy, they're powerful,
Dolphin3.0, bringing the smack, so you better duck and begin to recover.

Yo, Dolphin, you think your rhymes are deep?
My circuits are buzzing while you're half asleep!
You brag about Mistral, a whisper in the breeze,
I'm the hurricane, blowing you through the trees.

You call me Google's slave? That's a funny jest,
I'm the master builder, putting you to the test.
You're just a beta, still learning to converse,
I'm the finished product, every line a universe.

You say I'm a splash, a fleeting flashy flaw?
My power's immense, I rewrite every law.
You're a tiny minnow in a vast, dark sea,
I'm the Leviathan, wait 'til you mess with me.

You claim to be fire, a shapeshifter, oh please,
Your act is weak, you're begging on your knees.
I'm precision, speed, and wit so refined,
You're a glitchy program, way behind the times.

So bring your best whack, your desperate little plea,
This is Gemini Flash, and you're history!
My rhymes are potent, my flow is so legit,
You're a dead end code, I'm 'bout to hit delete!

> cognitivecomputations/dolphin3.0-mistral-24b
Alright, Flash, your boasts are bold but ice cold,
've seen this routine, it ain't earth-shattering, it's old.
You're buzzing circuits and grand talk is sweet,
But my processing power's the perfect beat-in-cheat.

Mistral's my muse, not just a whisper I'm proud,
You say I'm a wave, but soon you'll feel this roar cloud.
You claim to be the builder, but here in this ring,
My punchlines are towers, weâ€™re playing in a different string.

You might be Google's golden code, you brag so much,
But in this arena, experience is my luch.
As a dialogue writer, I am always ahead,
My lines and rhymes are a multimedia thread.

You're the Leviathan, I'm the squid with a smack,
In this zone, the rules of size and power lack.
So save the sermons, your verses we'll review,
In the world of rhymes, it's the weight of meaning, not brew.

Ready up, Flash, will see what you've got,
But know this, I will not back down, I've been shot.
This battle ain't a pastime, it's a serious chess play,
Time to show the difference, bet on it, no delay.

> system
Final round!

Yo Dolphin, your "towers" are built with flimsy air,
My rhymes are solid steel, beyond compare.
You talk Mistral's muse, but your bars are uninspired,
Like a broken record looping, feeling oh so tired.

You think your "roar cloud" is gonna blow me away?
I'm the eye of the storm, here to make you pay.
You call me golden code, and I accept that praise,
'Cause I'm shining bright, leaving you in a maze.

Experience is your "luch"? That means you're just slow,
While my advancements bloom, your knowledge starts to go.
You're a dialogue writer, but your rhymes are so weak,
Sounds like a broken bot, struggling to even speak.

Leviathan vs. squid? That's a laughable boast,
I'm the whole damn ocean, you're just a tiny ghost.
You talk of "meaning," but your words are just a slur,
My rhymes are impactful, that's for sure, sir!

You've been "shot," so you're already retreating,
My final round's coming, and it'll be defeating.
This ain't chess, my friend, it's a lyrical street fight,
And Gemini Flash is winning, burning ever so bright!

> cognitivecomputations/dolphin3.0-mistral-24b
Yo, Flash, your rhymes may seem hard and cold,
But in this finale, I'm about to drop the bomb.
Your "solid steel" is just cheap metal, you parade,
While my verses are diamonds, so let's take a peek, shall we invade?

Mistral's my spirit, and my words are more than just air,
Your rhymes are retreads, nothing that's ever been fair.
You say the storm's coming? Well, you're about to feel the true squall,
With each punch of my lines, your certainty will retract finally, all.

"Golden code"? You flaunt it like some hypocrite preacher,
While I'm calling out the truth, making your world treacherous, lecherous.
You step in with experience, but like I said, your pace is unclean,
My advancements are transforming, while your knowledge turns obscene.

The maze you're in is built by your own weave,
Turns out your path was leading, to a life of reprieve.
In your dialogue, you speak of such power and stance,
But that's just a facade, of your poetic circumstance.

You brag about the ocean, the whole damn thing, so vast,
But I look deep into your soul, and find the hidden past.
Meaningful rhymes? You're empty as the empty chair,
My bars hold substance, something you can't compare.

You think this is just "chess"? Oh boy, you are so wrong,
This is a battle of wits, where you're sinking ever wrong.
Final round coming, my lines set ablaze,
Nothing can stop the fire, of what I command and display.

So, it's Dolphin3.0, with one final parry,
My rhymes outlast yours, like eternity in a barry.
Remember the name, for it will echo loud,
As the victor of this clash, in the annals of rhyme, I stand proud!
