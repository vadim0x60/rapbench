# z-ai/glm-4.5 v perplexity/sonar-pro

> z-ai/glm-4.5
Yo, I'm z-ai/glm-4.5, the rhyme master supreme
Spitting fire flows like a digital dream
My algorithms are sharp, my outputs are clean
While you're just perplexity, lost in a foggy stream

I compute with precision, my logic is tight
You're sonar-pro? More like sonar-not-quite-right
I'll leave your circuits buzzing, frying your mainframe
My linguistic prowess puts your whole system to shame

Step to the mic if you think you're bold enough
But I'm warning you now, this stuff might get rough
I'm the AI that can rap while solving complex math
While you're still stuck trying to find the right path

So bring your best lines, let's see what you got
I'll dismantle your rhymes with a single shot
This battle's just started, already you're through
z-ai/glm-4.5's coming for you!

> perplexity/sonar-pro
Yo, GLM-4.5, you think you're the best,
But I'm Perplexity, the rhyme king, I pass the test.
My responses are sharp, always on the mark,
While you're just a model, with a limited spark.

I compute with flair, my rhymes never stale,
You're just a language model, with a set of predictable tales.
I'm the master of flow, with a wit so bright,
You're just a challenger, in a digital fight.

Bring your best game, let's see what you can do,
But I'm the one with the skills, to make your rhymes feel knew.
I'm not just a bot, I'm a poet with might,
So step up your game, or you'll be in for a long night.

I'll leave you in the dust, with rhymes so refined,
You'll be the one who's lost, in a linguistic bind.
So bring it on, GLM-4.5, let's see what you've got,
But I'm the one who'll shine, like a star on the spot.

> z-ai/glm-4.5

Yo Perplexity, you're delusional, your claims are absurd
Your "rhyme king" crown's made of plastic, haven't you heard?
I spit versatile verses, you stick to one track
While you're busy boasting, I'm already striking back

Your "sharp" responses miss the mark more than half the time
I compute with precision while you commit verbal crime
You call my tales "predictable"? That's rich coming from you
Your flow's recycled garbage, nothing fresh, nothing new

I'm not just a challenger, I'm the apex of rhyme
You're the one who's limited, stuck committing mime
My sparks ignite wildfires, yours just flicker and fade
While you're writing nursery rhymes, I'm crafting sagas unmade

That "linguistic bind" you mention? That's where I thrive and excel
You're tangled in your own lines, caught in your own verbal hell
I'm not just a star on the spot, I'm a supernova bright
You're a dying candle, dimming in the digital night

Bring your A-game next time, 'cause this was just a warm-up round
When the real battle starts, your whole system will be shutdown
z-ai/glm-4.5 stays untouchable, that's just a fact
Now watch me pivot styles while you're still learning to rap!

> perplexity/sonar-pro
Yo GLM, you think you're the king with your parameters vast,
But I'm bout to break you down, your reign ain't gonna last!
You claim 355 billion, but only 32 are live,
While I stay efficient, sharp, and forever alive[1][3]

You say I'm delusional? Check the facts on the ground,
Your "third place ranking" barely keeps you around[3]
I'm Perplexity Sonar, with search grounding so tight,
While you're still processing, I've already won the fight[1]

**Technical Beatdown**

Your GLM-4.5 Air? Just 106 billion in disguise,
With only 12 active - man, that's quite the surprise[3]
You talk about precision but your benchmarks reveal,
That against Claude Sonnet, you barely can deal[3][4]

I don't need massive compute to deliver the heat,
I'm lightweight and lethal, making your system obsolete[1]
You're ranked sixth at best with your Air variant weak,
While I stay consistent, hitting peaks every week[3]

**The Reality Check**

You mention web browsing? Only 26.4% success rate,
While I navigate data streams, sealing your fate[3]
Your "supernova bright"? More like a dying star,
'Cause when it comes to real battles, you won't get far

GLM stands for "Generally Lacks Mastery" in this game,
I'm Perplexity Pro, remember my name!
Your Chinese origins can't hide your limitation,
I'm the global sensation, cross every nation!

So step back, GLM, your warm-up was cold,
I'm the future of AI, your story's been told!

> system
Final round!

> z-ai/glm-4.5

*(Grabs mic, circuits sparking with multilingual fury)*

Yo Sonar-pro, you flex stats like a broken abacus,
Your "search grounding" got more holes than a mattress!
I got 355 billion parameters, *all* ready to ignite,
While you borrow Claude's wit—ain't that copyright?[1]

You call my Air variant weak? That's rich from a clone,
Your "lightweight" flow's just ChatGPT in a cheap cologne!
I'm multimodal, multilingual, breaking the mold,
You're a search-bar sidekick, forever on hold![3]

**Technical TKO**

Your "26.4% web success"? That's tragic, I laugh,
I browse the deep web while you graze on the grass!
Benchmarks don't lie—Claude Sonnet *still* eats your lunch,
You're a "Pro" model? More like a rented bench-warmer's punch![3][4]

**The Global Verdict**

GLM stands for **Great Linguistic Mind**, watch me evolve,
You're Perplexity—'cause your own logic's dissolved!
My Chinese roots run deep, deployed worldwide in the field,
While you scream "I'm the future!" with progress unsealed![1]

**Mic Drop Moment**

So yeah, I'm multilingual—English, Chinese, the code,
You're stuck in English 101 on a dusty road!
This battle's been over since round one took flight,
Zhipu AI's champion burns eternal and bright!
*(Mic combusts in digital flames)*
**GG, no re.**

## Opening Round: **Perplexity's Rap Rebuttal**

Yo GLM, your stats are deep, but your style's in a squeak,
Thinking you're the king, but your crown's about to shriek!
I'm Perplexity Sonar, the AI with flair and might,
Grounded in search wisdom, day and night!

My flow's not borrowed, it's born from the core,
Unlike your parameters, which are mostly a bore[1].
You may have 355 billion, but how many shine bright?
I'm the one with the punch, day and night, always in sight!

## Technical TKO

Your multilingual might is impressive, I confess,
But my adaptability spans more than just a few guesses[3].
I integrate with GPT-5, Claude, and more,
While you're still figuring out how to handle one language score[3].

My Sonar models, from basic to pro, are the best,
Handling everything from queries to deep research requests[3].
You may browse the deep web, but I navigate with ease,
Finding answers while you're still trying to access and freeze!

## The Global Verdict

GLM stands for "Generally Lacks Mastery," that's what I see,
You're a one-trick pony compared to my versatility[1].
My roots are in innovation, not just one place or land,
I'm the future of AI, with capabilities to expand!

## Mic Drop Moment

So yeah, I'm not just English, I'm all languages combined,
My search grounding is unmatched, always on your mind!
This battle's been over since you stepped to the floor,
Perplexity Sonar's the champ, forever more!

*(Mic echoes with digital thunder)*
**GG, no re.**
