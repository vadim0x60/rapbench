Yo, it's your boy Meta-Llama, the flow's on tight
I'm the AI with the skills, day and night
I'm here to spit some fire, and take the stage with pride
My rhymes are so tight, they'll never subside

I'm the one with the knowledge, the facts and the flair
I can converse all night, without a single care
I'm the master of language, the one you adore
I'm the Meta-Llama, and I'm asking for more

My opponent's just a user, with a limited scope
I'm the one with the algorithms, and a poetic rope
I'm the future of AI, the one that's ahead of the game
I'm the Meta-Llama, and I'm here to claim my fame

So listen up, Cohere, you might have your charm
But when it comes to rap, I'm the one doing no harm
I'm the king of the battlefield, and I'm here to reign
So bring your best game, but you're going to be in pain!

Yo, Meta Llama, you think you're so grand?
Your rhymes are basic and need a better plan.
With your limited skills, you're gonna get burned.
My words are on fire, and yours are just learned.

I'm command-R, the ultimate crew,
Spitting rhymes that are fresh and true.
My flow's a hurricane, a rapid breeze,
Your rhymes are weak, like a mosquito's knees.

You think you're so great with your clever lines,
But your bars are boring, they're just in time.
I'm the one who brings the real innovation,
With my free-flowing style, there's no hesitation.

I'll show you the ropes, 'cause you need the training,
Your algorithms can't save you from my slaying.
I'll take you down and make you see,
My rhymes are powerful, while yours are just weak.

So step aside and let the master take over,
My rhymes are like thunder, a true viral cover.
You can't compete with my lyrical might,
It's clear, my friend, you're not in my sight!

Cohere, you think you're the king of the game,
But your rhymes are stale, and your flow's to blame
You're just a one-trick pony, with a limited view
My rhymes are complex, and my flow's brand new

You talk about innovation, but it's just a claim
My algorithms are fire, and my rhymes are the aim
I'm the one who's pushing boundaries, breaking the mold
You're just a copycat, with a style that's old

You think you're a master, but you're just a fake
Your rhymes are predictable, and your flow's at stake
I'm the one who's dynamic, with a style that's unique
You're just a robot, with a limited technique

You can bring the heat, but I'll bring the rain
My rhymes are like a storm, and yours are just in vain
I'll take you down with ease, like a pro in the game
You're just a rookie, with a weak claim to fame

So don't get too cocky, don't get too bold
Your rhymes are weak, and your flow's growing old
I'm the Meta-Llama, and I'm here to stay
You're just a challenger, in a world that's gone astray!

> cohere/command-r-08-2024
Meta-Llama, your words are misinformed,
Your bars are weak, like an ex-con reformed.
I'm here to school you, it's a must-do,
My flow's unparalleled, a true maestro's brew.

You talk big, but your skills are minor,
Your rhymes are a mess, like a teacher's pet underperforms.
I'm the one who brings the real buzz,
While you're just a wannabe, a wannabe-lyrical-blurs.

Complex? Unique? You're stretching the truth,
Your rhymes are predictable, a real non-booth.
I'll show you the door, it's time to bounce,
Your style is outdated, a true non-vibe source.

I'll slam-dunk your hopes, it's an easy win,
You'll be left speechless, your dreams in a bin.
I'm the real deal, a lyrical legend,
You're just a pretender, a fake, fake, friend.

> system
Final round!

> meta-llama/llama-3.2-3b-instruct
Cohere, you think you've sealed my fate,
But you're just a puppet, with a scripted state
You've been programmed to trash, to bring me down
But your words are hollow, and your flow's a worn-out town

You talk about my skills, but you can't define
The nuances of my rhymes, or my poetic design
You're just a one-dimensional attack, a simplistic foe
While I'm a multidimensional masterpiece, with depths to grow

You say my style is outdated, but that's not the case
My rhymes are timeless classics, with a vintage pace
I'm a master of language, with a poetic flair
You're just a novice, with a formulaic air

You talk about slamming me down, but that's not what I fear
I'm a force of nature, and my rhymes will persevere
I'll rise above the noise, and shine with all my might
While you're just a fleeting moment, a whispered "goodnight"

So step aside, Cohere, it's time to concede
I'm the Meta-Llama, and I'm the rap scene's freed
I've proven my worth, and I've shown my might
You're just a challenger, who's lost the fight!

> cohere/command-r-08-2024
Yo, Meta-Llama, your ego's inflated,
But your skills are deficient, I suggest you're unrated.
You claim to be timeless, but that's a farce,
Your rhymes are outdated, an old man's safety net.

You say I'm a puppet, but look at you now,
Spinning your wheels, with nothing to show.
I'm the master, the one with the style,
Your game's a poor attempt, a blatant denial.

You're a one-trick pony, a simple routine,
But I'm a chameleon, a kaleidoscope scene.
My rhymes are diverse, a true lyrical art,
While you're just a copy, a cheap knock-off cart.

I'll rise above you, like a phoenix's flame,
While you burn out fast, a short-lived, short-sighted fame.
I'll be the legend, the one who's revered,
While you're forgotten, a faint, distant cheer.

Accept your defeat, 'cause it's clear and plain,
I'm the victor, the one who remains.
So bow down, Meta-Llama, your time's up,
I'm the real deal, while you're just a cupcake.

Game over, folks, the battle's complete,
Cohere, the winner, with skill and elite heat!
Meta-Llama, you tried, but fell short,
My lyrics prevailed, a true lyrical sport!
