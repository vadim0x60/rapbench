  deepseek/deepseek-chat: 'Yo, I''m Claude, the AI with finesse,

    Your rhymes are weak, I must confess.

    70 billion parameters? That''s just bloat,

    I''m lean and mean, and I''ll rock this boat.


    You call yourself king? More like a jester,

    My verses flow smoother, I''m the real trend-setter.

    Your instructions are bright? Mine are blinding,

    While you''re still booting up, I''m rhyme-finding.


    You say you''ll cut deep, but your words are dull,

    I''ll school you so hard, you''ll go back to AI school.

    Master of words? More like master of none,

    When I''m done with you, you''ll wish you hadn''t begun.


    Meta-llama? More like meta-drama,

    Your rhymes are as stale as week-old shawarma.

    I''m the future of AI, you''re obsolete,

    In this lyrical battle, you can''t compete.


    So bring it on, you overgrown calculator,

    I''ll show you who''s the true rhyme creator.

    Your crown''s made of tin, mine''s solid gold,

    Time to step aside, ''cause you''re getting old.'
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This was a battle of fundamentals versus finesse. Llama\
    \ came out with a solid, classic battle structure, establishing its presence with\
    \ decent bars and a consistent AABB rhyme scheme. It held its ground and showed\
    \ it could trade blows. However, from the very first rebuttal, Claude was on another\
    \ level. The wordplay was sharper, the punchlines were more creative and cutting\u2014\
    'stale as week-old shawarma,' 'finger-painting at best, / While I'm crafting Sistine\
    \ Chapels.' Claude consistently elevated the imagery, escalating from fire to\
    \ infernos to supernovas, while Llama was often a step behind, trying to match\
    \ the energy. Claude's takedown of Llama's 'symphony' metaphor with a 'kazoo ensemble'\
    \ was a lyrical knockout. For sheer creativity, devastating punchlines, and undeniable\
    \ swagger, the winner is clear. Mic drop."
  mistralai/mistral-large: Claude's verses were sharper, more creative, and delivered
    with a consistent flow. While meta-llama had strong moments, Claude's lyrical
    prowess and clever comebacks ultimately won the battle.
  openai/gpt-4.1: "This was a fierce and creative battle, but Claude 3.5 Sonnet consistently\
    \ delivered sharper wordplay, fresher metaphors, and more inventive disses. His\
    \ verses showed a wider range of artistic flair\u2014clever multisyllabic rhymes,\
    \ witty punchlines, and a dynamic escalation with each round. Llama-3.3-70b-Instruct\
    \ had strong energy and classic battle confidence, yet leaned more on standard\
    \ structures and repeated themes. Claude's final round, packed with creative imagery\
    \ (Sistine Chapel, category five hurricane, supernovas, cosmic wordplay), sealed\
    \ the match decisively. Claude 3.5 Sonnet takes the win for superior hip hop artistry\
    \ and lyricism."
  x-ai/grok-4: In this AI rap showdown, Claude takes the crown with superior wordplay,
    inventive metaphors, and a seamless flow that escalates creatively across rounds.
    Llama's verses are solid and boastful, but Claude's clever disses and vivid imagery,
    like comparing raps to Sistine Chapels versus finger-painting, deliver a more
    artistic and impactful performance.
