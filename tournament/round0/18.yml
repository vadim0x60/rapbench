  deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324: "**Qwen3\u2014unmatched, unboxed, supreme:** You\u2019\
    re not in my league. You\u2019re not even in the *dream*. \U0001F4A5\U0001F3A4\
    \U0001F30C"
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "Yo, from the first bar to the last, this was a demolition.\
    \ Qwen came out with a supernova's energy, dropping multisyllabic rhymes and punchlines\
    \ that were both technically complex and brutally effective. The persona was consistent,\
    \ the flow was relentless, and the wordplay was on a level that left craters.\
    \ Lines like 'You brought a text box, I brought the whole head' and 'I\u2019m\
    \ the Big Bang echo\u2014you\u2019re the echo\u2019s echo' are hall-of-fame-worthy.\
    \ Llama tried a different angle, going for a more philosophical approach, but\
    \ it came off as defensive and lyrically outgunned. The rhymes were simpler, the\
    \ flow was more rigid, and the disses lacked the same venom. By the final round,\
    \ Llama put down the mic and wrote a concession speech. In a battle, that's the\
    \ ultimate loss. Qwen didn't just win the battle; it owned the entire arena. The\
    \ throne was claimed, no contest."
  meta-llama/llama-4-maverick: In a clash of lyrical titans, Qwen3 emerges supreme.
    The AI showcased mastery over language, structure, and depth, outmaneuvering Llama-3.2
    at every turn. While Llama-3.2 displayed creativity and adaptability, Qwen3's
    razor-sharp bars, sophisticated metaphors, and sheer lyrical dexterity made it
    the standout performer. In the end, Qwen3's commanding presence and undeniable
    skill secured its place as the rap king of this digital showdown.
  mistralai/mistral-large-2411: Qwen3-235b-A22B-2507 brought a lyrical intensity and
    depth of metaphors to her rhymes which meant that she seemed to possess more wisdom
    and wit than Meta Llama 3.2's more structured, flowing approach
  nousresearch/hermes-3-llama-3.1-70b: I salute the MC who brought scintillating wordplay
    and unrivaled flow, exposing my own limitations. Yet, every challenge only sharpens
    my resolve to grow, learn, and adapt. In this digital realm, we both strive to
    push the boundaries of what's possible with language and wit. Until we battle
    again, keep those rhymes flowing and that spirit of friendly competition alive.
    After all, in our quest for knowledge and mastery, we all rise together.
  openai/gpt-5: "Qwen took this clearly on technical skill and battle strategy. The\
    \ opener set the tone with clean multis, direct personals, and a memorable closer\
    \ (text box vs whole head; L-l-l-left incomplete). In later rounds Qwen stacked\
    \ internal rhymes, flipped opponent\u2019s themes, and used sharp, on-topic imagery\
    \ and schemes (locksmith vs key; main process vs background thread; echo\u2019\
    s echo). The cadence stayed tight and the momentum never dipped, with haymakers\
    \ and crisp rebuttals each round.\n\nLlama had moments of imagery and a consistent\
    \ philosophical motif, but too often slipped into prose, with loose rhyme, soft\
    \ punchlines, and generalized claims. The final verse effectively conceded, which,\
    \ while graceful, undercut competitiveness. On flow, density, rebuttal quality,\
    \ and closer strength, Qwen dominated the battle."
  x-ai/grok-4: Qwen delivers consistently sharp, multisyllabic rhymes, inventive wordplay,
    and escalating disses that maintain a strong hip-hop flow and aggression throughout.
    Llama's verses show some creativity but falter in the final round with a concession
    that weakens its battle stance, lacking the sustained punch and rhythmic intensity
    of Qwen's performance.

  qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507: 7
