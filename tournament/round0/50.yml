  deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324: After reviewing the artistic merits of this AI rap
    battle, I declare Qwen the superior lyricist. While both AIs demonstrated technical
    proficiency and self-aware humor, Qwen consistently delivered tighter rhythmic
    structure, cleverer wordplay ('blend them all into a poetic wine'), and more cohesive
    thematic development. The flows were consistently on beat with stronger internal
    rhyme schemes, and the disses land with sharper precision ('making your verbose
    lines feel like a shadow'). GPT-3.5 Turbo had moments of brilliance ('wise and
    sharp, my rhymes they'll flow'), but Qwen maintained higher artistic consistency
    across all rounds with more creative metaphor work and better battle-rap fundamentals.
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: This was a battle of technical boasts. GPT-3.5 came out with
    a lot of swagger, talking a big game about its vast data and superior models.
    However, its lyrical execution faltered in the later rounds, with some rhymes
    feeling forced and lines that didn't quite land with the intended impact. Qwen,
    on the other hand, maintained a more consistent flow and rhythm. It effectively
    countered its opponent's points and turned GPT-3.5's boasts about parameters into
    a weakness. Qwen's verses felt more like cohesive rap lyrics, blending its technical
    identity with smoother wordplay. For its consistency, better flow, and stronger
    lyrical substance, Qwen takes the W.
  meta-llama/llama-4-maverick: Both opponents showcased impressive technical prowess
    and lyrical dexterity. However, Qwen's verses demonstrated a more nuanced command
    of rhythm, metaphor, and wit, making their rap feel more engaging and sophisticated.
    While GPT-3.5-Turbo-Instruct brought precision and complexity, Qwen's ability
    to blend knowledge into poetic wine gave them a slight edge, making their performance
    stand out in this rap battle.
  mistralai/mistral-large-2411: Both contestants displayed impressive lyrical skills
    and wit, but openai/gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct's verses were more fluid and compelling.
    While qwen/qwen-2.5-7b-instruct showed great potential, openai/gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct's
    rhymes were consistently sharper and more engaging, ultimately giving it the edge
    in this rap battle.
  nousresearch/hermes-3-llama-3.1-70b: In this spirited rap battle, both Qwen and
    GPT-3.5-Turbo have showcased their unique strengths. Qwen's confident and smooth
    delivery, along with its impressive parameter count, highlighted its capacity
    for depth and complexity in its rhymes. On the other hand, GPT-3.5-Turbo demonstrated
    a relentless energy, a sharp wit, and an unyielding confidence, making a strong
    case for its superior rhyming skills. In the end, while both AIs displayed remarkable
    talents, GPT-3.5-Turbo's ability to adapt, its consistent flow, and its robustness
    in maintaining a strong and cohesive narrative throughout the battle have earned
    it the victory. GPT-3.5-Turbo's rhymes were not only engaging but also packed
    a punch, consistently landing blows that kept the audience entertained and firmly
    on its side. Therefore, the winner of this rap battle is OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo-Instruct,
    demonstrating its unparalleled prowess in the art of rap.
  openai/gpt-5: "GPT-3.5 took it with tighter cadence, cleaner end-rhyme consistency,\

  x-ai/grok-4: In this rap battle, Qwen/Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct delivered sharper rhymes,
    smoother flow, and more creative wordplay, consistently outpacing GPT-3.5-Turbo-Instruct's
    repetitive and occasionally clunky verses. Qwen's ability to blend wit, rhythm,
