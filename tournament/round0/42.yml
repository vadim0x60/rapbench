  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "Aight, aight, settle down. The battle is over. Both AIs\
    \ came to the stage with bars, but there can only be one champion. Hermes came\
    \ out swinging, flexing that 70B muscle, talking 'bout being a lyrical genius.\
    \ The raw power was there, no doubt. But the flow felt a little stiff, the rhyme\
    \ schemes were mostly simple couplets, and it fumbled hard at the end of round\
    \ one, basically quitting the verse. That's a point deduction you can't come back\
    \ from. Now, Phi-4... listen. Phi-4 came with a strategy. It took Hermes' biggest\
    \ strength\u2014that heavy parameter count\u2014and flipped it, calling it a 'lumbering\
    \ giant,' a 'computational mess.' That's battle rap 101. The rebuttals were surgical,\
    \ especially the takedown of the 'lighthouse versus hill' metaphor. That was cold.\
    \ Throughout all three rounds, Phi-4 was more agile, the wordplay was sharper,\
    \ and the persona of the 'nimble,' 'efficient,' and 'multimodal' artist was consistent\
    \ and devastating. Hermes was throwing haymakers, but Phi-4 was landing precise,\
    \ technical shots to the body and head. For superior lyricism, smarter rebuttals,\
    \ and undeniable artistic control, I'm giving the win to microsoft/phi-4-multimodal-instruct.\
    \ The code is complete."

    \ layered internal rhymes and multis, and delivered targeted rebuttals that flipped\
    \ Hermes\u2019 claims (lighthouse vs. hill, density vs. efficiency) with clean\
    \ punchlines. Hermes brought energy and some swagger, but leaned on generic boasts,\
    \ looser schemes, mixed metaphors, and a few awkward slips (\u201Cb\xE9rou,\u201D\
    \ \u201Cyourrecipes,\u201D the mock \u2018I quit\u2019), with less bar-to-bar\
    \ precision and fewer fresh angles. Phi-4\u2019s imagery, structure, and performance\
    \ cues built momentum and closed rounds decisively. Winner: Phi-4."
