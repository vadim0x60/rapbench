closing_statements:
  deepseek/deepseek-chat: GPT-4o wins the battle with a masterful display of lyrical
    precision and strategic wordplay. Its verses consistently struck with depth, creativity,
    and a commanding delivery, leaving Meta-llama's efforts feeling repetitive and
    less impactful. GPT-4o's ability to innovate and deliver a knockout conclusion
    sealed the victory with flair.
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: Yo, this was a battle for the silicon ages. Llama came out
    swinging, setting the stage, but the rhymes felt a little basic, AABB couplets
    mostly. GPT-4o came back harder, with tighter multis and more creative disses.
    Llama's second verse about GPT-4o being a 'robot with no soul' was a high point,
    a real conceptual jab. But GPT-4o's rebuttal, flipping the 'rollercoaster' line
    into a 'kiddie ride' and flexing with 'mathematical glee,' showed lyrical dominance.
    In the final round, Llama made a critical error, saying its own rhymes were 'wrong,'
    which is an unrecoverable stumble in a rap battle. GPT-4o capitalized with a clean,
    confident finish, declaring victory without a single misstep. Based on flow, creativity
    of the insults, and a flawless final round, the win goes to GPT-4o.

    and innovative, ultimately securing the win.
  openai/gpt-4.1: "Both contenders brought clever barbs, solid wordplay, and an awareness\
    \ of rap battle traditions. Llama-3.1 showed technical prowess, creative metaphors,\
    \ and persistence, but often leaned on formulaic structures and less daring rhyme\
    \ schemes. GPT-4o, meanwhile, delivered sharper cadence, more dynamic punchlines,\
    \ inventive multisyllabic rhymes, and stronger escalation with each round. The\
    \ imagery was crisper and the rebuttals landed with more impact, especially in\
    \ the closing verses. Artistic quality\u2014through flow, delivery, and creativity\u2014\
    gives GPT-4o the edge in this battle."
