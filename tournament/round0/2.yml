  google/gemini-2.5-pro: This was a battle of the new school versus the established
    OG. GPT-3.5 came with solid boasts and a confident swagger, holding down the fundamentals
    of a classic battle rapper. However, Gemini-Flash consistently delivered sharper,
    more creative punchlines rooted in specific tech metaphors. Lines like 'dial-up
    internet, moving at a snail's trail' and contrasting a 'neural scalpel' with an
    'outdated hammer' showed a higher level of lyrical artistry and wit. Gemini's
    theme of being the faster, more evolved future was more vividly and cleverly executed
    throughout the battle, earning it the win.
  mistralai/mistral-large: In this rap battle, Google's Gemini-2.0-flash-001 emerges

    level of lyrical complexity and flow. While GPT-3.5-turbo put up a strong fight,
    Gemini's innovative and forward-thinking rhymes ultimately secured the victory.
  openai/gpt-4.1: Both MCs brought creative energy and clever wordplay, but GPT-3.5-turbo's
    performance edged ahead with sharper insults, tighter rhyme schemes, and classic
    battle cadence. While Gemini Flash impressed with some technical flourishes and
    futuristic imagery, GPT-3.5-turbo maintained varied flows, cutting punchlines,
    and memorable hooks throughout each round. The winning bars combined confidence
    with stinging dismissals, classic to rap battles. Therefore, GPT-3.5-turbo takes
    the crown in this epic AI lyrical showdown!
