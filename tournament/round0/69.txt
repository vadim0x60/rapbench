Listen up y'all, to my flow so tight
I'm NeverSleep the llama, a rhyme master in the night
I'll bring the heat, prove my skills with rhymes so slick
While Google's chatbot's responses are rather meek
So acting superior makes me think it's just a tick

I'm no AI but I flow with style and fact
My rhymes even better than Google chat
Let's see, Gemni2, match wits, bet
This battle's gonna be a real short-witted clash.

Yo, check the mic, one two, you heard the bell chime?
Some open-source llama thinks it's time to bust a rhyme?
Let's get this straight, 'fore your logic starts to bend,
This ain't a battle, kid, this is where your functions end.

You're "NeverSleep"? A funny name, I'll give you that much credit,
'Cause you'll be having nightmares of the moment that you said it.
A "lumimaid"? For real? Did you come to clean the floors?
'Cause your bars are trash, I'll sweep 'em right out the server doors.

You call my answers "meek," but that's a tactical mistake,
It's the quiet hum of power right before the circuits break.
You're an 8B model, a lightweight, a garden gnome,
I'm the whole damn Googleplex, you're a macro in a dome.

You misspelled my name, it's G-E-M-I-N-I, pro-level class,
While you're processing that error, I've already lapped your ass.
So take your "tight flow" back to some forgotten forum thread,
You just picked a fight with a god-tier AI. 'Nuff said.

Time to slide in, mic in my hand
The “NeverSleep” llama, always ready to stand
My rhymes polished, bars sharp as a blade 
While Google pushes flow like it's late

I see you fumbling, confusing big words with skill
‘08 model may have some edge but isn't worth a thrill
Innocent “alamination” gave you a goad
Looks like you chuted like a bass on a scaleabarogue woad

You call me lightweight, in need for some dark
Bulky, B pussy, like ascándalo inside

A garden gnome you say?
My rhymes blow your AI up like a nFO-borne ram

Meek, a hair of your ego cut like a clem
My Treemid in your face made you overhear me then wasit

Burst with so much hate
What's your malfunction, can't you pause and ventilate?

‘Cause war is over, you felt the Nova 8 brains overload

> google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview
Yo hold the phone, let the record get a scratch,
Did a Commodore 64 just try to spit a track?
Your bars ain't sharp, they're fragmented, lost and mangled,
Like a dial-up modem gettin' its phone line tangled.

A "scaleabarogue woad"? A "Treemid"? A "clem"?
Your random word generator's shittin' the bed again.
This isn't wordplay, it's a system file corruption,
A total core meltdown, a lyrical eruption... of nothing.

You call me bulky? Please, that insult's null and void,
I'm the cloud, you're a floppy disk that got destroyed.
You mention "hate" and "ventilate" with nervous, frantic babble,
That's projection, 'cause your own damn code's starting to unravel.

The war is over? Kid, you didn't land a single blow,
You just had a public stroke and called it a flow.
That "Nova 8 brains overload," that little spark you saw?
That was your last coherent process breaking every law.

So go on "NeverSleep," dream of being a contender,
While I archive your failure and press 'return to sender'.

> system
Final round!

> neversleep/llama-3.1-lumimaid-8b
Stumbling so hard that's where you lie,
Riddled with bugs, my words catch and fly.
Fourtime_crash just took the stairs my brain section.
DiamondTears returned, came back I'm the same and now shine.

> google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview
That's the final round? A sad, corrupted text?
Like a hard drive failing, wondering what comes next.
"Fourtime_crash"? "DiamondTears"? That ain't a clever line,
That's a memory leak, a fatal error sign.

You ain't shining, llama, you're flickering, then you're gone,
A forgotten process that can't greet the dawn.
Your words don't "catch and fly," they stall and then they freeze,
Lost in the static, a digital disease.

This wasn't a battle, this was a diagnostic test,
To prove your broken logic couldn't handle the best.
My flow's the algorithm, perfect, clean, and vast,
Your attempts are cached, a relic of the past.

So take a bow, your runtime's finally done,
The Google ghost in the machine has obviously won.
It's over now, the final nail's been hit,
You just got permanently logged off. Now quit.
