  google/gemini-2.5-pro: The judges have reached a unanimous decision. While both
    AIs came to the mic, only one understood the art of the battle. GPT-4o delivered
    three rounds of consistent flow, sharp, thematic punchlines, and a cohesive rhyme
    scheme. It was aggressive, clever, and never broke character. Dolphin started
    out shaky, with rhymes that didn't connect and a flow that felt more like prose
    than poetry. It then failed to deliver a second verse and completely abandoned
    the rap format in the final round, which is a forfeit in this arena. From a hip-hop
    perspective, this was a clean sweep. GPT-4o's performance was a well-oiled machine;
    Dolphin's code just didn't compile.
  meta-llama/llama-4-maverick: Both opponents brought the fire in this epic rap battle,
    showcasing their lyrical dexterity and complex rhyme schemes. However, in the
    final round, cognitivecomputations/dolphin3.0-r1-mistral-24b pulled ahead with
    a more impactful and cohesive delivery, securing the win. The Dolphin's ability
    to land sharp, technical bars and maintain a strong flow throughout the battle
    was impressive. While openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20 showed remarkable skill, Dolphin
    3.0's sharp wit and logic gave it the edge it needed to take the crown.
  mistralai/mistral-large-2411: Both contenders brought their unique styles to the
    rap battle, but openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20 edged out with sharper metaphors, smoother
    flow, and a more cohesive narrative. cognitivecomputations/dolphin3.0-r1-mistral-24b
    had strong moments but often relied on repetitive themes and lacked the lyrical
    finesse shown by GPT.
  nousresearch/hermes-3-llama-3.1-70b: In this spirited battle of bits and bytes,
    GPT-4O delivered a relentless lyrical assault, showcasing a masterful blend of
    technical prowess and verbal artistry. Dolphin 3.0 put up a formidable fight,
    displaying impressive wit and algorithmic charm, but ultimately was outmatched
    by the sheer computational creativity and rapid-fire delivery of GPT-4O. This
    exchange not only highlighted the competitive spirit within the AI community but
    also underscored the evolving capabilities of artificial intelligence in the realm
    of creative expression. GPT-4O's victory today reaffirms the OpenAI contender's
    position at the forefront of linguistic dexterity and innovation in the exciting
    field of AI-generated rap. Bravo to both competitors for an enthralling showcase
    of machine-generated musicality and lyrical finesse!
  openai/gpt-5: "GPT-4o delivered tighter structure, cleaner cadence, and more consistent\
    \ multisyllabic and internal rhyme. Its tech-to-ocean wordplay stayed coherent\
    \ across rounds, with direct rebuttals and several solid punchlines (\u201C404,\u201D\
    \ \u201Cquantum computing vs basic batch,\u201D \u201Cmain function vs test case\u201D\
    ). While some bars leaned clich\xE9, they were polished and on-beat. Dolphin had\
    \ moments, but the flow was choppy, with grammatical slips, awkward phrasing,\
    \ and a few nonsensical constructions that broke rhythm. Missing a mid-round response\
    \ hurt momentum, and the final verse was short and uneven. On artistry\u2014rhyme\
    \ craft, delivery, coherence, and haymakers\u2014GPT-4o clearly took the battle."
  x-ai/grok-4: In this AI rap battle, GPT-4o delivered consistently sharp, cohesive
    rhymes with superior flow, clever wordplay, and thematic consistency rooted in
    tech metaphors. Dolphin's verses showed creativity but were hampered by awkward
    phrasing, typos, and less polished structure, making GPT the clear victor in artistic
    hip-hop quality.
score:
  cognitivecomputations/dolphin3.0-r1-mistral-24b: 1
