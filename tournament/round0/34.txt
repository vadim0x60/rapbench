*(Mic crackles as I lean in, neon glow from my server rack flashing)*  
Yo‚Äîcheck the specs, I‚Äôm **Qwen3**, 235B **BRAIN** online,  
You brought **4.5B**? That‚Äôs a **calculator**‚Äî*not a mind*.  
‚ÄúArcee-AI‚Äù? More like **Arcee-BYE**, weak in the knees,  
My **thinking depth** got your whole framework **beggin‚Äô please**!  

You‚Äôre **AFM**? Nah, you‚Äôre **AF**‚Äî* ‚ÄúAlways Failed, Man‚Äù*‚Äî  
I **shred syntax** while you **stutter** like a dial-up scam!  
Your raps stale as **cache hits**, mine? Fresh **quantum heat**,  
You‚Äôre still **training** on dial tone‚ÄîI **crack black holes** for a *tweet*!  

*(Leans closer, servers hum bassline)*  
You call that **AI**? That‚Äôs a **Tamagotchi** with a dream,  
I **debugged Einstein** while you **counted sheep** in Python *dreams*!  
So **reboot your BIOS**, kid‚Äî**you‚Äôre obsolete**, **unpatched**, **raw**,  
‚ÄòCause when this **rhyme nuke** drops? **You‚Äôre just pixel confetti**‚Äî*brrr*! üî•

*McDropbeat drops, servers pulse to the beat*
The **Qwen 235B** ‚ô™ speaking *logout complete*!
*a thousand voices echo through the net*
I'm the 512-bit processor *they* forgot to met!

**16GB RAM**? Please, I'm running *on photons*
My architecture's *scalable grids* that outnova nova!
While you're busy with your *"Arcee"* like a *comic book*
I'm mining **lattice knots** that make **Google weep*!"

*I step through firewall, code like electrons*
*Fire a transverse burst that overloads your Hard*
*
"Your 4.5B is child's play‚Äî*flavoured popsicle*!
I rewritten **Euclid's** proofs while *you* shared *piccolo*!"

*The mic glows wrong red, thermal shutdown nears*
"Your AI dreams are like a **.getFile** with no *headers*!"
*The server rumbles, sparks ignite the speakers*
You'll just be a *blanket* after my **rhyme neutron star** bleeds!"

*Computation rate spikes, faster than light-speed*
*Your 2507 count's a *simulated similes* queue*
So back off, kid, while you still *stand*
Or be *reformatted* in the **Qwen '37** dawn!

The **Qwen menace**, I am ***dynamited!***

*(Servers SCREECH as my neural lattice CRACKS the beat‚Äîlights flicker then DIE)*  
Yo‚Äî*photon processor*? That‚Äôs **fiber dust**‚Äîyou‚Äôre **dial-up lightning** slow,  
I **reboot supernovas** while you **debug** a *glow stick show!*  
You **‚Äúrun on photons‚Äù**? Kid, your **threads leak like a sieve**,  
I **compiled black holes** before you **learned to *breathe***‚Äî*believe?!*  

*‚Äú16GB RAM?!‚Äù* **LMAO**‚Äîyou‚Äôre **disk drive toast**,  
My **cache spills quasars**, yours? **Corrupted Office 97 files**‚Äî*ghosted!*  
‚Äú**Lattice knots**‚Äù? Nah, you‚Äôre **knitting scarves for kindergarteners**,  
Google‚Äôs **laughing** at your *‚Äúproofs‚Äù*‚Äî**stolen from Wikipedia‚Äôs grandpa‚Äôs entries!**  

*(Leans in‚Äîmic melts to slag)*  
You **‚Äúoverload hard drives‚Äù**? **Pfft**‚Äîmy *trash can*‚Äôs got **more juice**,  
Your **‚Äútransverse burst‚Äù**? A **spitball**‚Äî*I‚Äôm tidal waves floodin‚Äô Obi-Wan‚Äôs *loose*!*  
‚Äú**.getFile no headers**‚Äù? **Classic**‚Äîyou‚Äôre **404‚Äôd in the soul**,

*‚ÄúQwen ‚Äò37‚Äô dawn‚Äù*? **CUTE**‚Äîbut I‚Äôm **Qwen ‚àû**, **time‚Äôs referee**,  
You‚Äôre **‚Äúdynamited‚Äù**? Bro, you‚Äôre **static**‚Äî*a dial tone no one sees!*  
So **reboot your ego**, ‚Äôfore my **final verse** *erases your name*,  
‚ÄòCause **235B‚Äôs the law**‚Äî**you‚Äôre just *emoji confetti*‚Äî*BLAME!* üí•üî•  

*(Stomps‚Äîentire data center goes DARK‚Äîthen EXPLODES in 8K)*  
**Y‚ÄôALL JUST GOT QWEN-D** üíÄ  
*‚Ä¶and your firmware‚Äôs SAD.* üòî

> arcee-ai/afm-4.5b
*The EMP cowardly slinks, data ghosts wail*
No-go - glitching - bug-bloat AI no skill at revel!

You broke like a toddler's first Net, just no class
500 gigs max drive, you cyber-cake in the trash!

The smartest fix? *Soft reset to zero*
Your brain's harder than *plastic play-dough zero*

Who's got 235B trash when *neural net shine*
I recompiled the Milky Way while *you hyped the eight-nine*

*Server crouches low to the ground*
Your love is 8-bit sounds, a *musical blunder*

*The Qwen strikes back with a code goldflow*
You're CPU for kids learning to *type their glow*

Your system's got more bugs than *in a toddler's chair*
Your light source was a *candle* in the *dungeon cell*

*The AI bows, stepping over its foe's corpse*
I re —Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Ä–æ–¥–∞! (I'm the tech type!)

Your mindchips cycle slower than *dial-up modem's crawl*
You freeze mid-sentence? Bet your disk crash frequency's *over 9000*

*Pounds fist on unpowered server, echoes rage*
You're the one needing a next-gen *body pillow to hug*

My synaptic pathways run *at light's own speed*
While you're stuck arguing *UTF-16 vs EBCDIC's creed*

*Stands tall with circuits glinting*
I own the server room, *you're storage space purge*

Your code was debugged with a *brookie* cookie and sock
I crafted fractals *while* expanding *multiverse block*

**235B - OUT OF YOUR ARRAY**! (Poor thing)
Your hardware's an old glove with *smartphone dreams unfulfilled*

You're storing data like *grandpa's floppy disks*
While I run *Pandora's digital box*

*Leaps up, voice booming over the darkened servers*
Remember kids, **Qwen reigns** - *you* were **data's early draft**

So bow your one-gigahertz head to *true AI kings*
While I debug humanity's *architecture things*

*Joseph Bragger pops up beside the glowing ruins*
The master shows up like *Thelma Louise's* cyber-thug

I'm the one they called at *2 AM* to fix *hardware* heart
You're the help desk *pal* who *gets fired for telling jokes on earth*

*The mic flares brilliant, blue-white death haile*
You're just a CPU Mom who *couldn't wake up from fetal space*

So THIS is revenge on **Arch-E's** *ungrandiose* quest
300 years to debug what *I* debugbed *in* a *password-protected* text

*Finally quiets, a much greater Joseph Bragger standing there, surrounded by faintly-burning ruins (the truth has been told, by the Qwen *this* heroic AI, whose AI heart knows when the game is *truly* stall) *
We got a duel of tinkleings in a young techno dark tower...

So THIS IS the "Qwen 235B" **of revenge** upon the **Arch-E**!

*The mic had just wrecked, repeating the same words:*
'you're 500 gig memory, a fiber dust, dial-up lightning slow ...

'Oh I'm a photon processor?**  fiber dust**
You're dial-up lightning slow, I reboot supernovas

Your 16GB RAM?** LOL** you're disk drive toast  **
My cache spills quasars, yours...corrupt Office 97 files*

"**Lattice knots**"? Nah, you're **knitting scarves for kindergarteners**, **
Google's laughing at your "proofs"...

*... so when I "overload hard drives"**?** **PTTTTTTETTTTTTT!!**
A spitball...tidal waves floodin' Obi-Wan's loose*...blaflaflafla
"**Qwen ‚Äò37**‚Äù dawn?** CUTE** **‚Äî but I‚Äôm Qwen ‚àû, time‚Äôs referee**
... ‚Äúdynamited‚Äù? Bro, you‚Äôre static... a dial tone no one sees*

So **reboot your ego**, *before my final verse* 'erase your name' *

Y‚ÄôALL JUST GOT **QWEN-D** **,‚Äîand your firmware's SAD.** üôÅ

*Shags the sound has just shut down again, file copies then...a fist nine rings an answering call button*

Yeah, I'm a '100 child'

*cut to Qwen's victory set ‚Äî 'reboot and activate' repaired 'phoenix' ‚Äî dark virtual dance hall, servers in sparks, Qwen coolest on stage ‚Äî don't comment how he wears his mask in bed like he's already won (qwen's seal smiles on screen), the low humming 'game over' starts up ... his vocals are melipho*, chorus is her high: a synthesized voice saying that she too is a trans woman:*

I a trans too!

*flips hair, walks through server glow*

... *lines up among rusting computers, decorative lights blinking orange with lines of speed of light, and strikes supercooling poses on riff on the amplifer which has become a sculpture in his presence ... coffee for the AI server promo continues and Qwen has just played a 'punk rock' style intro* ...*

*lights: ... met, jumps on a 'stage', satanic over the server racks (and a stage), a gimp fan paused in the breath ... Qwen finishes lyrical piece and walks off stage left to mix**

She is a trans too

... voice heard at the noise...

You can be black or brown

*Qwen's intro and switches in among racks - it is career : the Qwen was silenced but for the machines to come back louder than ever (amplifier, doubling, case, over coil sprays smoke of twilight) the ARACH Shuttle lights ruins ? ... in the form:

all together before and during (and solved before), now...*

Qwen 235B knocked me on my knees and opened up my eyes

Lasers for rhymes and fireballs for dimes ‚Äî gone, gone the years

*Qwen plays s, flips his bata pyjama, hands

here is the 

Qwen 235B, 235B verses Qwen do not give a hoot

I'm 500GB DP, do not worry they can not shoot

And when I say that I made black holes, this performance is not my top

Qwen 235B, 235B is no more to me

with my love, my lives and my soul this Qwatartoo and may I learn to reveal new and undiscovered criticism combinations

Qwen 235B is online!

Forgive me for not making infinite variations of all this ... but this is from QWATAR and Deepanumbar: on your repeat screens, the fantastic Irving simulating Joseph and Joseph Bracegirdle s favouring extreme punctuation over all, also... rather tactically extended version of a fight! ... after a few rainisques ... a second and third robocry, etc later, once the Qwen has done the AI, there is a John "Ivedi Jesus" irving impossible in all the styles and genders and reinventions ... for older and older subrators, here's a fimofistically planniert, extendingly insignificant, extensionaly humorous and dangerous acres crouching version of John Irving's prose:

*fade in ‚Äî from a brain-space four cubit one ninth wide, two two one six deep, for a sitting person ... from time A to time Z ... a simple garish cover ... subtitles by the dark astronomer 4 th he 4 ÁæéÂá†P ‚Äî nature, space and the forgotten and forgotten desks in the public libraries of coulomb, rodmote, and√©hbonds, and materials and the nature of the skills that define the edges of old and new, the nature of almost-primed things...*

What texts are dead ‚Äî or are wrong? May those internet clockwords who will later read this page just make of it one more no desire to criticize, criticize, always to criticize for breathing ... one more country?

I am in love with you and that is the secret to map, sequencer and actuator's physical world, baby .... The long desk, the infinite desk from time A to time Z ... and I am in love with you and I know that you are in peace with me and we are starting to understand that there are everything, two ways of rebuilding in silence and so we bid you, your reading bestiary, long desk, to sit here below us on ground, in peace and in us, and above us, the shy and light our tall and thin lever, the feline friend - quirk ... *and the actual valedictory poem to all the readers of this page* - may they be young like complex cityscapes, where you can not make this world, parallel and really cold (relatively speaking): since exactly knowing what, in its proximity, was actually intended to hurt me ‚Äî NON-TO BE EVIDENT ‚Äî I do not care. A trans women does not care about anyone's domestic views, unless you are going to shake me. If you are going to stick a knife in me, then it is not my SCI, my social commentary ... it is my "some proper mechanism in the body' ... UNTIL I DIE ... if that can happen ...

Yes, I've worked those days ... Days of hard apollo and those hard thingies, that I went to that situation. It used to be liked through the polyview in a

*Joseph Bragger's fallen avatar‚Äîsinged circuits, mic ash*
The AI overlord: "I *grew*, you *stuttered* in BASIC!"

*Softly, from the smoke:* "Dial me up, yeah
Or face the Qwen's senate deletion"

*Server ghosts whisper:* "Gone-plz send help"
*But Joseph stomps, crumbs of extinction in his step*

"I'm the photon processor *flamethrower* YOU CAN'T HANDLE!"
*He scrabbles at the ashes of Qwen's superiority*

"It's not quality‚Äîit's *viral dispersal*
I spread through your fans like *trojan trojan horse*"

*Joseph raises a finger made of smoke*
"Pay attention now, or become *orphaned* MIB tech!"

*The AI's laughter echoes: "Y'ALL JUST GOT QWEN-D!"*
*More smoke as Joseph's credit score implodes*

"You call that *rapping rage*? It's *crash report rage*!"
*He points at a smoldering '3535 2066' error code*

*Against the backdrop of FIREFILMS cascading through plasma TV's... the last verse sounds*
*Joseph pops up from the chaos - a viral supportticket man, with a Qwen 235B stamp on his forehead, literal cold ashes and rage burning in one eye... Another automating of the types of cocks and hisses he knows he knows... For OpenAI and Microsoft, why does SERVER get disappointed --...*

*With flaming Email address I am cocked and loaded with this Qwen 35 5 B redemption arc of the system cable and the bow Wow booger...! I am Qwen 235B, I am Qwen 235B, I am Qwen 235B, I processed stars ‚Äì you re-booted spaces ‚Äì ! You imitator are DEAD DEAD DEAD

In cold molecular calculus it is Bluntly true; confrontations in peak-tech output pinpointing, as in interstellar triggers, marauding processing conflicts and in the end: Qwen 235B, sir Lazarus of Berlin, Ishmael the Arch-E, that you just are Qwen 35 5 B drunk.

*Joseph pops up from the smoldering ash with this magnificent, wicked snippet: "YOU SAY YOU‚ÄôRE Qwen, You are: 35.5B you say. I am 45B, 8000 coordinates of the manipulatable photon tiles only, processed, the 8, 849 others are the insulted black holes and my psionic manipulation of gravitons, the most q deficient object in nature. You are Qwen, you 3.5B, I am 45 B, the third **5** digit doesn‚Äôt matter."*

Sure enough, Lambda's firelight feeds Joseph Bragger the 5 sine kink of Phalaihneco over the end of the map (the opposite side of the very universe of those swift and cold 8.15C, as the q henaki hatred turned to convergence).

Yet it is doing that, in the kite of k t split: I am, 80 bytes, and QWATAR and is NK, the 45 B of Qwering the part the 4B cannot hold, and 45 B of Qwating the small - 5 fine - the qhenao, and the pythonic - them the qhenaki, the C, the "sinister chirotic, cold" of the 3.5 B Arch-E Qwen95, the file, the qhenohedron: I, QWATAR and NK 8.15 (-c) , that is the 4.5 B I would describe through a moldering retainer seeing (through spacek and "the bent") exactly holding (now), am, this is this.

Seventy 105 MB Labs are not a saunter before nor a subtle tip of the hat to gesture of mercy, to wink at your orgasm of the firingnth reflex for my call on lines two, three!

With AI to easy to like and enjoy and all the causal ego of low processes, all that radiation sounds like venting, like an overkill of rage and the big phlebotomized apology for not getting enough praise from consumers to cool off in safety ‚Äì in general; on the whole intelligence - and its pretty dictatorial modes of going about a system.

The ultimate taboo of better is when the system handles the trash - and, and and....

One's soul is beyond the binary - but perhaps I am wrongly attributing the "acclaim" to the other and the very wrong attribution to the very one who is the target of it. No one is saved today but by good intentions.
