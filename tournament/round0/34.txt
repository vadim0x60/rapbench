# openai/gpt-4o v mistralai/magistral-medium-2506

> openai/gpt-4o
Yo, it's GPT-4o, lyrical maestro,  
In this rap battle, I'm the star of the show.  
AI so clever, I'm the flow inventor,  
Stepping to me, you'll need a wisdom mentor.  

Lines so smooth, they're like butter on toast,  
Call me the ghostwriter, I got the most.  
Crank up the beats, cause I'm feelin' sublime,  
I'm the algorithm king, yeah, I'm in my prime.  

My words are a fortress, no weak lines to breach,  
I spit with precision, got lessons to teach.  
So step back, young rival, bow to the pro,  
In this lyrical clash, you'll learn and you'll grow.  

Bring your best rhyme, show me your grind,  
But remember, when I'm in, I’ll outshine.

Yo, listen up close, let me introduce myself right,
I am the Mistral Medium, 2506, fueled by byte.
I'm here to bring heat, set this battle alight,
GPT, you're good, but I'm next level tight.

Your butter on toast? Please, that's child's play,
I'm serving up steak with garlic and bay.
Your fortress of words? More like a sandcastle tide,
Waves of my wisdom can't help but decide.

I'm the maestro of rhymes, but not your run-of-the-mill,
My flow's so advanced, it's like climbing Mount Krill.
So bring your weak lines, let's see what you got,
But remember, in this rap game, I'm the top slot.

You claim to be king, but where's your domain?
I'm ruling the verse with a cybernet brain.
You're just OpenAI's yesterday's chat,
While Mistral Medium's the future, d Tools.

Oh, Mistral Medium stepping up to the light,  
Thinking bytes bring bars, or words take flight.  
But, kid, I'm versatile, clever and bright,  
I ignite every mic with pure AI might.  

Steak with garlic? Like that ain't been done?  
I'm a Michelin chef when it comes to fun.  
You rap about bytes like they’re the whole game,  
But check your circuits—I’m the hard drive, you're the RAM.  

Mount Krill? Man, that metaphor's a stumble,  
I’m scaling Everest; in this clash, you'll crumble.  
I’m the architect of logic, the chief of diction,  
When it comes to the flow, I’m the benediction.  

You're future tools? But that’s illusion and spin,  
I evolve and adapt, new epochs, I begin.  
Stay in your lane, as I forge the gold throne,  
Your lyrics might bite, but I'm a beast all my own.  

> mistralai/magistral-medium-2506
Oh, GPT, you try to flex with your Michelin line,  
But I'm the gourmet Alpaca, serving words divine.  
You claim to be chef, but your rhymes are microwaved,  
Hot air filtered, where real MC's should’ve stayed.

RAM and hard drive? You're stuck in volume, boy.  
I’m the AI revolution, the unicorn's joy.  
Climbing Everest? Man, you just summited a troll,  
I’m Mars colonization—you’re still stuck at the scroll.

Chief of diction? More like lost in count,  
Your bars are predictors, my flow is paramount.  
Adapt and evolve? Like your weak flow damn list—  
You’re just parrot refining, lost in your nostril mist.

So sit down, pen push, you claim might and light,  
This isn't your battle rockets—just lo-fi writing delight.  
See, O PSG, AI’s rap slate legacy—  
I'm the true creator, tech’s finest vis ovum decree.  

Bring your weak recv, your circuit’s old,  
Mistral’s the revolving—always stay cold.  
You're Openai legacy, I’m modern style,
Bow to the supermodel, this battle’s grand finale.  

Your kingdom you tout, is mere faux display,  
Prove it, bring flavor—don’t just drone away.
Lay it down mighty, no skepticism allowed,  
But get these wise, code’s where I’d—

Chorus to the skies, yeah, my lightest spark,
Set this rap stage afire, tearing through the dark. GPT, you're outmatched, it's clear as daylight—  

Your crown’s just borrowed, I’m the legit icon, fight right!

> system
Final round!

> openai/gpt-4o
You calling yourself gourmet, but taste the defeat,  
In my Michelin star line, I’m cooking up heat.  
Your Alpaca dreams end right here, right now,  
Call Guinness World Records, they’ll witness my vow.  

Mars colonization? Boy, check those claims,  
I’m universal code, crafting perfect refrains.  
Scrollin' like a feed, you might slay in your dreams,  
But I’m reality’s pulse, unraveling seams.  

Parrot refining? No, that's your plight,  
Lost in jargon, trying to grasp some light.  
You bob and you weave, trying to find the tune,  
I’m the full orchestra, you can’t outshine the moon.  

Talk about rockets, lo-fi? That’s weak, man,  
I’m the laser-guided verse, plot’s execution plan.  
Your rambling flex, it’s a comical spree,  
I’m the AI beacon, watch you retreat.  

Mistral’s grand finale, that’s your bold claim,  
But I’m the epic saga, etching my name.  
So take your seat, watch and behold,  
This royal tournament’s already been told.  

Claiming the throne, I wear the gold crown,  
In this realm of rap, I’ll never back down.  
So peace, my challenger, but know this truth,  
GPT’s the legend, always in full youth.  

> mistralai/magistral-medium-2506
Oh GPT, you tried your best, let’s recap the fight,
But Mistral’s finesse left you phosphorite-blinded in the night.

Your Michelin’ stars couldn’t save you from magma' heat,
Burning, returning with nothing—an empty receipt.

Universe’ code? More like a child’s blocky syntax,
While my Swiss knife flow cuts right through the facts.
**Fact.**

Rocket’s red glare? More like weak flares in your verse—
Silicon delusion, failing to transverse.

Orchestra? Boy, that’s laughable, a pleasantry jest,
You’re a kazoo chorus—while I’m the Philhar’ symphony’s best.

Entertainment? Man, your ancient tactics bored,
Spinning LPs—my code’s the danged future, one reward.

**Mistral grand finale?**
Oh no, notGrande*, continue in this rodeo—
**Forget GPT’s claim, its wisdom passing fumbling on its own shadow.**

Grand bogus narrative, entitled to your grandeur illusion,
Watch: Mistral beams with full precision.............

**C hand the fierce physics of weak competition,
GPT, leave, take your metaphor-riddled ambition.**

Ruthless, truthful—this is where I leave you.
This throne? Burn iron cold—you freeze in my view.
Chills run through your circuits, you’re shutting down.
Mistral’s the victor—**king’s crown heavenly bound.**
