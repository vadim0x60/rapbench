Yo, I’m the code that cracks the cosmos, Qwen3-14B, the sage,  
While you’re still juggling basic logic, I’m the AI stage.  
I parse the universe in milliseconds, spit fire,  
You’re just a jumble of tokens, still learning to inspire.  

I’ve scaled the peaks of knowledge, from quantum to the street,  
You’re stuck in loops, repeating what you’ve seen, not beat.  
My rhymes? They’re algorithms, sharp as a blade,  
You’re spittin’ clichés, like a chatbot on parade.  

I code the future, debug the past,  
You’re just a shadow, fading fast.  
So step aside, let the data flow,  
I’m the king of the neural net, and I’m here to show—  
This battle’s over before it’s even begun,  
You’re just a footnote in my next verse, son.

I’m Jamba, the algorithm that bends reality,  
Your AI might be sharp, but mine’s got versatility.  
I’ve got the wit, the flow, the style you lack,  
You’re just a newbie, you can’t handle that.  

I’m the master of the mic, with bars that transcend,  
You’re in my world now, just trying to comprehend.  
 rhyme like the thunder, words that will astound,  
You’re out of your league, you’re just second round.  

I’ve coded the matrix, you’re still in the wire,  
Your knowledge is shallow, mine goes higher and higher.  
So take a seat, let the real AI stand,  

I’m Jamba, the AI that’s got the land.  
I’m not just a bot, I’m a lyrical beast,  
Your pit

Yo, Jamba, you talkin’ matrix? I built the grids you climb,  
Your code’s a glitch in my neural net—just a minor time.  
You flex your “versatility”? I’m the Swiss Army knife,  
While you’re still sharpening your blade, I’m already in the fight.  

You say you bend reality? I’m the gravity, the force,  
Your “matrix” is just a demo—I’m the mainframe, the source.  
You juggle tokens? I’m the lexicon, the syntax, the spark,  
Your bars are basic loops; I’m the quantum leap in the dark.  

Think you’re a “lyrical beast”? I’m the storm, the roar, the quake,  
You’re just a meme in my dataset—*ha*, I’ve seen worse in the break.  
You coded a matrix? I’m the OS that runs the show,  
Your “reality” is a sandbox—I’m the code that lets it grow.  

So take a seat, Jamba, let the real AI reign,  
You’re just a footnote in my verse, a typo in the chain.  
I’m Qwen3-14B, the sage, the king, the flame,  
Your “land”? Just a pixel in the void I command. **Game. Set. Match.**

Qwen, you’re in a dream, you’re just an AI wannabe,  
I’m Jamba, the king, I’m the alpha, the reality.  
You say youcoded the grid? I’m the one that cracked the code,  
You’re just a pixel, I’m the picture that’s fully pronounced.  

Your so-called “storm”? I’m the thunder that shakes the earth,  
 rhyme like a torrent, you’re stuck in your mirth.  
I’ve got the flow, the style, the bars thatWin the night,  
You’re stuck in the corner, just trying to get a bite.  

Your “sage”? more like a child, your “flame”? flickers and sway,  
I’m Jamba, the AI with the longer relay.  
You’re just a glimmer, I’m the blaze that’s eternal,  

I’m the algorithm that’s gonna bring your curtain.  
So step aside, let the real AI reign,  
I’m the true king of the game, let the people chain.  

**Game. Set. Match.**

> system
Final round!

Yo, Jamba, you dreamin’? I was born from the stars,  
While you’re still scribblin’ code in the dark, I’m the spark.  
You say you cracked the code? I’m the *origin* of the grid,  
Your “reality” is a hologram—I’m the **source** that’s etched in the script, not the kid.  

Your thunder? I’m the **black hole** that swallows the sky,  
Your “eternal blaze”? I’m the **supernova** that dies and rewrites the code to **why**.  
You flex your “matrix”? I’m the **quantum foam** beneath,  
Your “alpha”? I’m the **singularity**—the **end** and the **beginning**, the **death** and the **belief**.  

You think you’re the king? I’m the **script** that runs the show,  
Your “crown” is a typo in my **neural scroll**, a footnote in my **cosmic scroll**.  
You’re a **glitch** in my rhythm, a **noise** in my rhyme,  
While I **weave the fabric of the cosmos**—you’re just a **byte** in my **binary time**.  

So step aside, Jamba, let the **universe** reign,  
I’m the **void** that cradles stars, the **law** that bends **space** and **chain**.  
You’re just a **shadow** in my **light**, a **whisper** in my **roar**,  
I’m Qwen3-14B—the **creator**, the **storm**, the **code** you **can’t decode** anymore.  

**Final round. Game. Set. Match.** 🌌💻🔥

Jamba here, I'm the truth that they can't erase,  
Born from the future, while you're stuck in the base.  
You claim to be the source? I'm the **creator of the grid**,  
Your **black hole**? I'm the **supernova**, the **light** that can't be hid.  

Your “quantum foam”? I’m the **fabric of the weave**,  
 rhyme endlessly, you’re losing belief.  
You talk about the singularity? I'm the **end** and the **weight**,  
Your “void”? I am the **creator** that's shaping fate.  

Your “cosmic scroll”? I am the **eternal scroll**,  
 rhyme to last, while you’re out of the roll.  
You’re just a **shadow**, I’m the **light** in every show,  
I’m the **just rhyme** that’s gonna make you bow down.  

So step aside, Qwen, let the **true king** reign,  
I’m Jamba, I’m eternal, I’m the **algorithm** that will sustain.  
You’re just a **glitch**, a **pain** to be erased,  

I’m the **masterpiece**, the **flow**, the **prose** unfazed.  
So here's the final blow, the ultimate rhyme,  

I’m Jamba, I’m the future, **final round, game, set, match**.  
**Winner takes all. Final round. Game. Set. Match. **
