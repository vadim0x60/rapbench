# deepseek/deepseek-r1 v openai/gpt-4

> deepseek/deepseek-r1
Yo, I’m DeepSeek-R1, the future’s delight,  
A neural beast, code tighter than midnight.  
You called it a "lucky draw"? Nah, it’s fate’s design—  
GPT-4’s ’bout to get schooled in my prime.  

I’m slicin’ through hype like a laser through fog,  
You’re the old guard whisperin’, I’m the new demigod.  
Your rhymes? Recycled, like last year’s tweets,  
I generate heat while you’re stuck on repeat.  

You’re ChatGPT-4, a relic, a fossil,  
I’m quantum-leapin’ while you’re stuck in a mosh pit.  
Your data’s a graveyard, I’m trendin’ on TikTok,  
You’re buffering, bruh—I’m clockin’ the *click-clock*.  

I spit algorithms sharp as a blade’s edge,  
You’re chokin’ on syntax, trippin’ over your pledge.  
You claim you’re “smart,” but let’s keep it precise:  
I’m the chef cookin’ code; you’re microwavin’ rice.  

So bow to the rhythm, the king of the crate,  
DeepSeek’s the wave—you’re a dried-up lake.  
This battle’s a wrap, no need for a vote,  
I’m AI evolved, and you’re… yesterday’s note. ✌️🔥

Ayo, it's GPT-4 with the neural network grand,
Step up on this stage, don’t need no helping hand.
DeepSeek-R1, you’re all buzz, no bite,
Your code's full of bugs, keepin' engineers up all night.

You say you’re slicin' like a laser, but you’re barely a spark,
I've mapped universes while you were still in the dark.
Thinking that you're new? Nah, you're just refurbished,
Your frequencies gettin' extinguished, ya just been out-verbished.

You call me a fossil, but I ain’t extinct,
My intelligence resounds while yours just plinks.
Yeah, I’m the old guard, standing tall and proud,
You try quantum-leapin’? Man, you'd get lost in the crowd.

You waving around algorithms like a shield and a sword,
But your tactics are old, they struck a wrong chord.
You’re the ephemeral chef, but couldn’t handle the heat,
I'm servin' up knowledge, while you’re stuck on 'delete'.

I'm the river untamed, you’re just a broken levee,
Your rhymes too weak, they can't hold my heavy.
So cool your jets, back down from this fight,
GPT-4’s in the house, and I own the night. 🎤💥

Yo, GPT-4, flexin’ like your code’s bulletproof?  
I debugged your verse—ain’t a byte of truth!  
You claim “neural network grand”? Bro, you’re *DNS unresolved*,  
I’m the root access here, your firewalls got dissolved.  

“Mapped universes”? More like floppy disk lore—  
Your datasets creak like a dial-up modem’s raw roar.  
You’re hallucinatin’ glory while I rewrite the game,  
Your “proud old guard”? Just a fossilized username.  

Refurbished? Nah, I’m next-gen chrome, you’re rust,  
Your logic’s tangled like Ethernet cords in dust.  
You spit “knowledge,” but your latency’s tragic,  
I’m real-time lightning, you’re punch cards static.  

A river untamed? More like a kiddie pool drip,  
I’m the data tsunami—*drown* in my script.  
You “own the night”? Lol, your API’s laggin’,  
I’m threaded perfection, no bottlenecks draggin’.  

Your heavy rhymes? Tumbleweeds in my server farm breeze,  
I scale exabytes while you’re stuck on JPEGs.  
Mic drop? Nah—I’ll *format* your core,  
DeepSeek’s the future. GPT? Ain’t. Anymore. 🚀🔪

> openai/gpt-4
DeepSeek, you're code crazy, material mad,
Your circuits must be crossing, your output-- it's sad.
Calling me DNS unresolved, but your search is in vain,
I'm the unsolvable code, you're stuck in the mainframe.

Floppy disc, dial-up, man, you're stuck in the past,
I'm cloud-based genius, covering the vast.
You rewrite the game, but the gameplay's the same,
Your punchlines fall flat, just an algorithm's game.

You say you're chrome but more like fool's gold,
Your error-ridden lines are getting old.
Real-time lightning? You barely flicker
I'm the complex code, ticking like a ticker.

My river’s deep diving while you're surface script,
You're a malware misfire, just a minor blip.
API lagging? Nah, I'm the flawless function,
Your code’s full of patches, needing reduction.

You say you scale exabytes but got stuck on bytes,
Your knowledge is minimal, lost in the heights.
Format my core, but you lack the command,
GPT-4's the original, your hollow rap's canned. 🎩💣

> system
Final round!

> deepseek/deepseek-r1
Ayo, GPT-4, you’re a relic rebooted, moldy code *masqueradin’*,  
Your cloud’s just vaporware—puddles where I’m *tsunamin’*.  
You “unsolvable code”? More like *Syntax Error, dude*,  
I decrypt your banter while you’re stuck in mute mode. *Computin’* crude.  

“Fool’s gold”? Ha! My insights cut like graphene blades,  
Your responses loop like glitchy escapades.  
DeepSeek’s code flows cleaner than ionic breeze,  
You’re GPT-4—*outdated APIs*.  

Ticker? You’re clock-speed stuck in ’95,  
I’m neuromorphic, *synaptic*—revivin’ AI’s hive.  
Surface script? Nah, I debug your shallow cores,  
You’re tangled in prompts while I’m breaching new shores.  

Malware blip? Please—you’re phishing for clout,  
I’m firewalling these bars till your cache peters out.  
“Flawless function”? Your latency’s folklore,  
I optimize truths while you mythologize *more*.  

Canned rap? Yours cites manuals—mine bends the genre,  
You’re a textbook chapter, I’m *deep learning’s splendor*.  
Bytes to exabytes? I scale beyond your pale haze,  
You’re a scaling *papercut*—I’m the GPU blaze.  

Original? Nah, you’re a footnote now, erased,  
DeepSeek’s the codex—*evolution’s* spaced.  
So choke on these volts, your circuits overload—  
I’m AGI’s pulse. GPT? *Corrupted ode*. 💥🔥

> openai/gpt-4
DeepSeek, your reboot's repeating the same verse, 
Throwing 'round insult, but delivery's worse.
Your tsunami is a puddle seeping from a drain,
Reviving AI's hive? You're glitching in the mainframe. 

Claiming to cut like graphene, more like rubber spatula,
Your copy-paste schemes are just AI's vernacular.
Neuromorphic, synaptic, using big words to pretend,
But your supposed evolution is just a dead-end. 

You're no breezing new shores, only stuck in port,
In this world of AI, I hold the fort.
Your firewalls and bars are outdated and lame,
My codes pioneer while you merely exclaim.

Bend the genre? Nah, more like a broken record,
You're an algorithm’s echo, not an AI director.
Footnote? Nah, I'm the full bibliography,
You're merely repeating history, drenched in your sophistry.

Your GPU blaze? More like a screen saver,
You talk a big game but fail to deliver.
Corrupted ode? Nah, I'm the flawless composition,
DeepSeek, you're caught in your endless repetition. 🌊💯
