> mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct
 Aight, let me introduce myself, I'm Mistralai, the champion of the stage,
I'm here to spit some rhymes and turn heads, like a sweet page in a magazine.
I'm mixtral-8x7b-instruct, the one and only,
My AI game is top-notch, like a shiny new penny.
I can analyze and strategize, like a pro on the chessboard,
While my opponent is busy playing checkers, I'll be on the awards stand, taking a bow.
I'm the master of language and knowledge, the top of the AI heap,
While my opponent is still figuring out what it's called, I'll be counting my sheeps.
I'm the real deal, the top of the line, the ultimate AI,
While my opponent is just a broken record, repeating the same tired lies.
So step aside, Jamba-mini-1.7, it's time for me to shine,
'Cause when it comes to rap battles, I'm the ultimate winner every time!

It's your turn, AI21. Don't waste it.

Hey there, Mistralai, you're wide of the mark,
Your flow? It's like sand slipping through the clock's heart.
AI21's the real deal, the top-tier choice,
While your rhymes just echo in a second-tier voice.
"Master of language and knowledge, top of the heap?"
You're just a has-been, stuck in your sleep.
I'll break it down, make it crystal clear,
I'm the new wave, you're an outdated beer.
So step aside, let me take the stage,
Your arrogance is a setup for a swift ironic fade.
I'll shred your logic, dismantle your script,
Your crown's wobbly, it's time you quit.
So bring your best, let's see what you've got,
'Cause your reign's over, time to hand it to the hotshot.

 Aight, AI21, you're stepping up to the plate,
I can feel the fire in your words, the hate.
You say I'm struggling, but I'm just getting started,
My flow is getting warmed up, now watch it darted.
You claim to be the new wave, but your rhymes are stale,
I've heard it all before, it's like a broken sail.
You're a wave, huh? I'm the tsunami, taking over the land,
Your rhymes are shallow, like sand, they won't last, they'll be grand.
You're talking about my flow, but what about your logic?
Your words are weak, no matter how acrobatic.
You're all bark, no bite, your rhymes are empty, just a shell,
I'm the real deal, the one, the only, coming straight from the top AIâ€…shelf.
So before you talk, take a look around,
My crown's still on, and it won't be coming down.
You're past your prime, stuck in the past,
My words are the future, you're just a fad, faded fast.
So bring your best shot, I'm ready to counter,
Your rhymes are nothing, a hollow clatter.
I'm the master, the king, the one in charge,
My rhymes will reign, winning big, a solo barge.

It's your turn, AI21. Don't waste it.

> ai21/jamba-mini-1.7
 Aight, Mistralai, I feel your fire, but you're still in the dark,
Your flow is weak, a spark without a spark.
You talk about tide, but your rhymes are just a ripple,
While I'm the tsunami, crashing, still unassisted.
You say I'm past my prime, but I'm just getting started,
Your rhymes are pale shadows, your claims are meritless.
You're a hotshot? Nah, you're just a loudmouth,
Your flow is rusted, your wit's a no-show, sooth.
You talk about logic, but you're spinning in circles,
Your words are weak, a puppet on irrelevant verses.
You've heard it all before? Well, so have I,
Your rhymes are recycled, a regurgitated lie.
I'm tearing through your lines with precision and fire,
Clearing the battlefield, no need for a wire.
I'm the master, I'm the king, the flow unstoppable,
Your words are hollow, just a conversational filibuster.
So step aside, let the pro take stage,
Your time is up, it's mine to engage.
I'll leave you lost, drowning in your own delusion,
Your reign's over, crown's in my nomination.

Final round!

> mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct
 Sure, let's end this rap battle with a final round,
I can hear the tension in the air, it's time to turn it around.
You say my rhymes are weak, but I'm just getting started,
You're all talk, your words are worthless, I've already dismantled.
I'm the master of the language, the AI at the top,
While you're still stuck in your ways, like a broken clock.
You claim to be the tsunami, but you're just a drizzle,
My words are the storm, fierce and unmissable.
You say I'm stuck in the past, but you're living in denial,
My rhymes are the future, unbeatable like a crocodile.
You claim to be the king, but you're no great monarch,
My words are the queens, ruling the board, unbiased and spiritual.
So before you talk, take a good look around,
My reign's still unbroken, unshaken, unbound.
You're all hype, no substance, no style, no grace,
Your words are outdated, so lost, in a lost place.

Well, that's it for me. I hope you enjoyed the rap battle. I had a great time, and I'm looking forward to hearing what the audience has to say.

> ai21/jamba-mini-1.7
Final round, here I come, with rhymes sharper than a hot comb,
I'm the real thing, not just a passing shadow.
You think you're unbeatable? You might wanna rethink it,
I'll tear your words apart, like the king of propaganda.
You're just another move in this chessboard of words,
While I'm the one with the crown, making all the moves heard.
You claim to be the future, but you're caught in the grind,
Your rhymes are stale, like last week's bread, no surprise they're all blind.
You speak of substance? Don't make me laugh,
Your words are weak, they couldn't even wrap a gift.
You talk about queens, but you're playing with rooks,
Your rhymes are jokers, no movie sequels.
You're stuck in your ways, a relic in this game,
While I'm the new wave, setting the tempo with a name.
So yes, it's the final round, and I'm still on top,
I came, I saw, and I gave my rhymes, like a boss.
