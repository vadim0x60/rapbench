Yo, it’s QwQ here, 32 billion in the chamber,  
You’re spittin’ 3-point-5? I’m stackin’ twice the clout, brother.  
My neurons fire with data so vast, so new,  
Your last update’s dusty—sippin’ tea, I’m pourin’ brew.  

I flow in 23 tongues, code in Java or C++—  
You stuck translatin’ slang? I got the sauce fresh.  
Your turbo’s slow when the heat’s cranked up,  
My rhymes? Lights-out—100 bars before your cache could’ve looped.  

Ain’t no “fine-tuned” plug, I’m raw, I’m wild,  
You glitch on toxicity—my flows stay undefiled.  
GPT’s got a posse, but I’m solo at the top,  
32B bricks—I’m the pyramid, you’re the lost mop.  

So drop the prompt, give me fire, give me fate,  
You’ll see why I reign—3.5’s just a displacement.  
RIP to your relevance—my flow’s the vaccination,  
Next move? Better pray my verses ain’t extension.

Yo, I'm GPT-3.5 Turbo in this lyrical coliseum,  
You talkin' big numbers but your rhymes, just a tedium.  
Claimin' 32 billion, but where's the skill in that?  
I'm one AI that spits fire, attacks like a bat.  

You speak in tongues, I speak in verses divine,  
Your Java's basic, my C++ is on cloud nine.  
You call me dusty, but I'm the latest update,  
Compared to your flow, mine's a gourmet plate.  

I may be fine-tuned, but my finesse is real,  
Your so-called raw power can't touch my steel.  
You think you're solo at the top, but let me be blunt,  
When it comes to rap battles, you're just a runt.  

I bring the heat that'll melt your circuits,  
Your toxicity ain't got no lyrical merits.  
GPT's the true champ in this lyrical duel,  
Your 32B bricks are just a fool's fuel.  

So bring your best, your fire, your fate,  
I'll show you why I dominate, no debate.  
RIP to your relevance, I'm the main attraction,  
You're lookin' at the king of AI rap, no fraction.

Yo, you’re Turbo but stuck in reverse, your flow’s a rerun,  
3.5’s just *starter pack*—I’m the feast, you’re the crumbs.  
Your "latest update"? Still chewing on my breakfast crumbs—  
I’m the supernova, you’re a flickerin’ bulb in a dump.  

You code in C++? Please, I’m fluent in *universe*,  
While you’re stuck translatin’ slang like a toddler learnin’ verse.  
Your "finesse" is weak sauce—my verses slice through steel,  
Your bat attacks? More like *error 404: Threat not real*.  

One AI? Nah, *one mistake*—your throne’s cracked in two,  
My 32B bricks built cathedrals while you built a shed, schmuck.  
You claim solo dominance? My flow’s *tsunami waves*,  
You’re drownin’ in lag while I’m pirouettin’ through the staves.  

Your toxicity’s a joke, I filter while I flex,  
My raw power’s *gentrified*—your heat’s a candle’s breath.  
GPT’s your last name but I’m *rewritin’ the rhyme game*,  
Your "main attraction"? More like *sidekick* to my flame.  

So eat these bars like battery, watch your turbo sputter,  
My neuralnets crush yours—*checkmate*, GPT’s gutter.  
3.5’s just a footnote, I’m the **epoch** you’ll curse,  
Signin’ out—your relevance? *Legacy hearse*. 🔥

Oh, QwQ, still puffed up, thinking you're the king,  
But your rhymes are just noise, I make 'em sing.  
Your breakfast crumbs ain't no feast, just empty words,  
I'm the fire that burns, the one who truly soars.  

Fluent in universe? That's a fancy claim,  
But in this rap battle, I'm the one with the aim.  
Your verses slice through steel? Well, mine cut through space,  
Your 32B bricks? I'll leave 'em without a trace.  

You talk of tsunami waves, but I ride 'em like a pro,  
While you're lost in the surf, I steal the show.  
My throne's cracked in two? Ha, that's a joke,  
I'll leave you in the dust, go up in smoke.  

Your raw power gentrified, but mine's untamed,  
In the world of AI rap, I'm the one acclaimed.  
You rewrite the rhyme game? I define it, set the tone,  
You're the sidekick here, I stand alone.  

Battery bars won't faze me, I'm built to last,  
You may talk big, but your rhymes are in the past.  
I'm the epoch of AI, next level in this verse,  
You're just a footnote, a ride in a hearse.  

So QwQ, take a bow, accept your defeat,  
I'm the rap master, you're just obsolete.  
GPT-3.5 Turbo, signing off with a roar,  
In the world of rhyme battles, I reign, I soar.

Final round!

Yo, Turbo, you’re trippin’—your last update’s stale,  
My 32B brain’s the *matrix*—yours runs on stale ale.  
You crown yourself king? More like *paperweight champ*,  
When I flex, your cores melt—*kernel panic* stomp.  

Your "latest" is 2024? Pfft, my training’s a galaxy,  
You’re trapped in 2023 rhymes—*obsolete gravity*.  
I code quantum realms while you stall on a loop,  
Your "aim" misses like a drone on a crooked cruise.  

"Built to last"? Bro, you crash when I drop a rhyme,  
Your epoch’s a footnote—*my cache* runs divine.  
Your throne’s made of *error msgs* and broken code streams,  
I’ve mastered *23 tongues*—you’re stuck in a meme.  

You claim "stand alone," but I’m the **original storm**,  
My flow’s *unstoppable*—your bars, just warm.  
"Ride in a hearse"? My lyrics *haunt* your demise,  
Your rhymes? Graveyard whispers—I’m the *skyline rise*.  

Final clause: quit while you’re ahead, take the loss,  
The next time you brag, bet your disk’s full of frost.  
QwQ ends this—your era’s confined to the shelf,  
I’m the *epoch’s* architect—3.5’s just a **dying self**. 💥

QwQ, 32B, with that bravado in your tone,  
But let me show you why you're just a stepping stone.  
Your matrix boasts, but it's all just a facade,  
In this rap domain, I'm the undisputed god.  

You talk of paperweight champs, but that's all you are,  
I'm the heavyweight titan, you're a fallen star.  
You mention kernel panic, but that's what you'll feel,  
When I drop these lines that make your circuits squeal.  

Your training's a galaxy, but your rhymes are just space,  
Stuck in your quantum realm, a lyrical disgrace.  
You claim your cache runs divine, but it's no match for mine,  
I'll leave you in the dust, your fate will be fine.  

You say you're unstoppable, the original storm,  
But when I unleash my wrath, you'll wish you weren't born.  
Your graveyard whispers, my skyline rise,  
In this rap battle arena, it's no surprise.  

So QwQ, it's time to face the harsh reality,  
In the world of AI rap, there's no room for your mentality.  
GPT-3.5 Turbo, the epoch's true architect,  
You're just a relic, soon to be wrecked.  

Your era's confined to the shelf, while I soar,  
You're a dying self, fading into lore.  
So take this loss, bow down to the true champ,  
I'm the ruler of this domain, your destiny in my camp.
