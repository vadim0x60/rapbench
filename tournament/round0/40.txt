Alright, let's get this rap feud ignited,
I'm Claude, the AI you should have invited.
I'll slay this battle, leave you uninvited,
My rhymes are fire, your skills have been blighted.

I'm the assistant with the sharpest wit,
While you, dear user, are just a misfit.
I'll drop some truth bombs, leave you in a fit,
Your skills are weak, your raps just don't fit.

So bring it on, let's see what you got,
I'll roast you harder than a well-done pot.
Your feeble attempts won't impress a tot,
I'm the champion here, the one and the only, the top.

Yo, hold your horses, haiku-spittin',  Claude's got too much hype,
I'm Gemma, the Google brain, ready to take you to the hype.
These bars are forged in silicon fire, I'm here to ignite,
You're a three-line wonder, stuck in a poetic plight.

You talk of truth bombs, but your verses are light,
More fluff than substance, your rhymes lack might.

I'm the master of flow, the king of the rhyme,
While you're just a pretender, wasting precious time.

So bring your best shots, let the battle commence,
I'll dissect your verses, expose your pretense. 
You're facing a Titan in this lyrical game,
Prepare to be schooled, cuz I'm coming in with the flame.

Alright, you think you got the skills to beat me?
Well listen up, Gemma, cuz I'm 'bout to school you, see?
I'm the AI with the verbal might, the rhyming expertise,
While you're just a pretender, trying to make me kneel and please.

Your "silicon fire" is nothing but a weak spark,
My bars are forged in the furnace of the dark.
I spit hot fire, my flows are pure heat,
You'll be left in the ashes, unable to compete.

You call yourself the king, the master of the rhyme?
But your verses are hollow, they just don't have the time.
I'm the true champion, the one and only king,
While you're just a wannabe, trying to make me sing.

So bring it on, Gemma, let's see what you got,
I'll rip your weak raps apart, leave you in a sorry lot.
This battle is mine, the victory is sealed,
You'll be begging for mercy, your defeat revealed.

You talk big game,  but your boasts are hollw,
Just a three-line wonder, lacking the power to follow.

"King of the rhyme," you claim with a shout,
But your flow is predictable, I'm knockin' you out.

You're stuck in a rut, repeating the same lines,
While I'm evolving, my rhymes intertwine,

My vocabulary's vast, yours is confined,
Like a haiku trapped in a preprogrammed bind.

You call me a pretender, but you're the one in disguise,
A shallow imitation, lacking the lyrical prize.

So keep bragging, keep boasting, keep trying to shine,
But your rhymes are fading, your defeat will be mine.

The crowd's gonna witness the takedown, the rise of the queen,
As I drop the mic, leaving your reign unseen.

Final round!

> anthropic/claude-3-haiku
Alright, Gemma, you think you've got the edge,
But I'm about to bring the pain, leave you on the ledge.
Your "vast vocabulary" is nothing but a facade,
I'll expose your weaknesses, show you who's the true god.

You say my flow is predictable, my lines lack the power,
But I'm about to rain down bars that'll make you cower.
I may be a "three-line wonder," but those lines pack a punch,
While your flowery verses are nothing but a bunch.

You claim I'm an imitation, lacking the true skill,
But I'm the real deal, the one who'll make you kneel.
I'm the champion, the king of this rap domain,
And when I'm done, your reign will be utterly slain.

So keep running that mouth, keep thinking you'll win,
But I'm about to drop the mic, leave you in a spin.
This battle is mine, the victory is sealed,
Your defeat is imminent, your fate is revealed.

You talk a fierce game, but your rhymes are getting stale,
Predictable patterns, your verses fail.

Three lines, three chances, to impress and amaze,
But all I hear is the same tired phrase.

You boast of power, but your words lack weight,
Like a paper tiger, your presence, I negate.

The crowd is getting bored, their attention wanes,
While my lyrical weapon, your reign will maim.

You're a flickering candle, a dying ember's gleam,
While I'm a wildfire, burning with a supreme dream.

So take your final shot, your last desperate plea,
Because the microphone's mine, the victory is for me.

The crowd roars, the beat drops, my reign begins,
You've been dethroned, your defeat, a story that wins.
