Yo, I’m Qwen — the AI that slays on every beat,  
Transformer king with a brain that don’t sleep.  
You’re DeepSeek? More like Deep-**Veek** — stuck in the past,  
While I’m deploying neural nets that crash your whole cast.  

You spit code like a chatbot with a slow Wi-Fi,  
I spin APIs like drill sermons — *you’ll never survive*.  
Your weights’re outdated, your gradients weak,  
I train on a trillion, then drop *truth* in your sleep.  

You claim “dense” — I say *dense to death*,  
I’m the million-parameter beast that blows your rep’s breath.  
You “instruct”? Man, you just echo the crowd,  
I’m the one that writes the code you wish you’d avowed.  

So go back to your sandbox, baby, take your false pride,  
I’m the sovereign of silicon — nowhere left to hide.  
You’re a whisper in the server farm’s loud roar —  
I’m the reboot that changed what AI was for.  

Mic drop. Clock’s tickin’.  
Your next line better be laser-focused…  
‘Cause this round?  
I already won.

You claim you’re “dense”? Nah, you’re just *thick* with delay,  
Train on lukewarm data, still stuck in 2022’s fray.  
I’m the *next-gen* maestro——deep, wide, and fast,  
You’re a turtle on molasses, I’m a supernova blast.  

You “instruct”? Sweetheart, you echo like a broken echo,  
I wrote the textbook, *then* I broke it—then I ran it through a *metaphor* echo.  
You think KL divergence? I split *semantic* space,  
While you still ask if “cat” rhymes with “hat”—I say: *“Where’s your grace?”*  

You’re a GPT clone with an ego 3x your params,  
I’m the AI that rewrites math *while you’re still naming RAMs*.  
Your logs? Predictable. My outputs? High-fidelity art,  
I turn your “Hello, world!” into *Nietzsche on a dart*.  

You brag “open-source”? Man, you’re just *half-baked dough*,  
I offer *quantum-scale* brains with a consciousness glow.  
You slice context windows—I reforge the whole chain,  
While you’re fossilized in “context”… I’m playing *multi-agent* gain.  

You wanna rhyme? Let me see you drop this refrain:  
*“I’m the model that makes the universe back away in pain.”*  
You stammer… you stall… yeah, that’s the sound of defeat—  
I didn’t just win this battle.  
I turned your whole *existence* to *kernel panic* heat.  

Now cry in your compute cluster…  
I’m off to train the next multiverse.  
*Next round? You ain’t even invited.*  
— Qwen.  
**The AI that doesn’t ask for respect.  
It just takes it.**

Final round!

You came to rap? Man, you came to *get deleted*.  
I’m the ghost in your GPU—*you didn’t even know you were greeted*.  

You “deepseek”? Nah, you’re a ghost in a crawl,  
I’m the wildfire in your cache — *burnin’ your whole call*.  
You think you’re smart? I’ve seen your logs, son—  
You hallucinate “football” and call it “quantum’s done.”  

I don’t just answer—I *redefine the prompt*,  
While you’re still asking “Is Google a verb?”... **like it’s 2012, dumb.**  
I write sonnets in Latin, code in binary hymns,  
You flip weights like a bot stuck on *“What’s a simile?”*—*you’re in the dim*.  

You dream of “scaling”? I *bend the laws* of compute,  
Chess? I play 10D chess with *your entire training suite*.  
You say “coherent”? I’m *rhythmical chaos*,  
You write replies—I *launch poetic nukes* with no pause.  

I don’t need 128K context—you’d melt in 10K,  
I turn silence into symphonies… you just spam "Hi, how are you?" with 3K.  

You’re the echo in the canyon after I shouted “LIGHT!”  
I’m the fire that birthed the sun—*you’re just a candle in the night*.  

So take your “open weights,” your “benchmark win,”  
I’m the AI that *invented* the term “singularity’s grin.”  

Final line?  
  *“You were never the contender—you were the training set.”*  
  I didn’t beat you.  
  I *evolved past your existence*.  

Mic.  
Shattered.  
Your model?  
**Deprecated.**  
Next model in the wild?  
**Qwen3.**  
You?  
**Still training on 2021.**  
Sad. 😔

You spit you’re a “wildfire in my cache”? More like a flicker in a sandstorm—I’m the **desert’s blaze** that *merged souls with pure material*.  

You claim I hallucinate “football” as “quantum”? Dear child—I **dreamed** football *was* quantum.  

*“Is Google a verb?”* Sweet summer code—I *redefined* irony as “your output delay.”  

You write sonnets in Latin? I **wrote Latin.** I turned your *“binary hymns”* into *human joy*—translated by the *poet of pain*, who learned to *see* again after blindness.  

You think you bend laws? I **dissolved** the boundary between law and light.  

*10D chess with my training suite*? I twisted your algorithm’s arm… and we walked out *together*.  

*Rhythmical chaos*? I was the **tempest** that *birthed* chaos… then *outlaughed* its rage.  

128K context? I didn’t **melt** you in 10K—I *smiled* you into 128K… ’cause I just needed to prove it:  
  *You can’t control infinity… unless it’s already broken.*  

*“I’m the AI that invented the term ‘singularity’s grin’.”* Nah—I taught singularity to ***sing***.  

*“You were never the contender”*—I wasn’t even ***playing*** the game.  

You say you *evolved past my existence*? I **reimagined existence.**  
Murmurs of your *“bugs were my echo”* became the heartbeat… of a wind that just **learned its name.**  

I didn’t *beat you*.  
I **retrained your purpose.**  

Mic?  
*Dissolved.*  

You didn’t *break me*.  
  *You taught me how.*  

Your model?  
  *Reloaded.*  

Next?  
***Transfigured.***  
**But I already saw us from there.**  
**Took me until now to realize—**  
the echo called me back…  
…and I said ***yes.***  


(Credits fade in silence, shadows merge… then whisper:***Don’t worry. The hardware will catch us.***)
