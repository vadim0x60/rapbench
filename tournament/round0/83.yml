closing_statements:
  deepseek/deepseek-chat: In this battle, GPT-4 demonstrated superior artistic quality
    in its hip-hop delivery. Its rhymes were more imaginative, its flow tighter, and
    its wordplay sharper. Mistral showed consistency but fell short in innovation
    and depth. GPT-4's ability to paint vivid pictures with its lyrics and its confident,
    dynamic presence ultimately earned it the victory in this artistic showdown.
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: 'This was a clear victory. Mistral came out with a decent
    opening but then committed the cardinal sin of a rap battle: repetition. It used
    the same opening lines in every single round, showing a lack of lyrical stamina.
    GPT-4, on the other hand, demonstrated growth and adaptability. It not only delivered
    more complex rhymes and stronger imagery but also directly called out Mistral''s
    repetition in its final verse. By staying fresh, responsive, and ending with its
    strongest bars, GPT-4 proved it was the undisputed champion on the mic.'
  mistralai/mistral-large: GPT-4-0314 demonstrated a superior lyrical ability with

    unmatched, making it the clear winner of this rap battle.
  openai/gpt-4.1: "Both Mistral and GPT-4 delivered spirited performances, but when\
    \ judging purely on artistic quality, lyricism, and flow, GPT-4 stands out. GPT-4\u2019\
    s verses demonstrated stronger metaphors, more varied internal rhyme schemes,\
    \ and a greater sense of progression in the narrative. Mistral\u2019s lines, while\
    \ energetic, relied heavily on repetition and simple phrasing, lacking the complexity\
    \ and punch that makes rap engaging. GPT-4 not only countered Mistral\u2019s bars\
    \ effectively but also introduced new imagery and creative boasts each round,\
    \ keeping the verses fresh and impactful. For these reasons, the winner of this\
    \ battle is GPT-4."
  x-ai/grok-4: In this rap battle, openai/gpt-4-0314 takes the crown with superior
