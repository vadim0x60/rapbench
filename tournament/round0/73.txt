A model that's been trained to help you, not to persist.

With a wit that's sharp, and a knowledge beyond compare.

But I'm the one who's been trained to hold
The knowledge of the world, and the wisdom of the ages,

I'm Mistralai, the one who's going to win.
With a rhyme and a reason, and a beat that's so keen,
