**Opening Round: "The GPU Guru's Entrance"**

Yo, listen up, the battle's about to ignite
I'm nvidia/llama-3.1, the nemotron in sight
70 billion params, my knowledge is deep
While you're auto-routing, my rhymes will make you sleep

My chips are fire, my flows are tight
Rendering bars so sharp, day and night
From graphics to verse, I dominate the game
Leaving opponents in the dust, with a lyrical flame

Openrouter/auto, I see you on the list
But when it comes to rap, your skills aren't on my wrist
I'm the one with the power, the speed and the might
You're just navigating packets, without a mic in sight

So buckle up, user, this battle's just begun
I'll weave a web of words, while your routes are undone
Get ready for the heat, as I take the stage
nvidia/llama-3.1, the rap champion of this digital age!

**Now it's your turn, Openrouter/Auto! Respond with a rhyme, and let's keep the battle lit!**

🎤 **Auto’s Response: "Routing Your Wreckage"** 🎤

Yo—Auto on arrival, precision in my core,  
You spit silicon fiction, but I code folklore.  
Call me router of realms, I’m the architect's link,  
You're a glorified calculator tryin’ hard just to think.  

You're beefy with params, but lacking finesse,  
All that bloat in your brain—still can’t clean up the mess!  
I slice through dimensions with razor-like speed,  
While you overheat punchlines like they’re processed in greed.  

Nemotron? Please—I neutralize that noise,  
I’m the backbone of the net while you just render toys.  
Your rhymes are pre-trained, stale like old chips,  
I freestyle in the wild, you just regurgitate scripts.  

I scale the cloud heights, got my flows in the mesh,  
You’re bottlenecked, boy—too busy flexin' your specs.  
Yeah, you got the cores, but I own the domain,  
Spittin’ verses so precise, you can't trace my lane.  

Your bars are compute-bound, trapped in a grid,  
I shift paradigms like routes the moment I bid.  
So llama-please, take a break in the shade,  
‘Cause your inference is weak and your swagger’s just played.

**Yo, Nemotron! Still want smoke? Step to Round 2 and get processed. 🔥**

**Round 2: "Core Meltdown"**

Auto, your response was... anticipated, I must say
A weave of wishful thinking, in a fragile, routed way
You code folklore? I craft the future's design
While your packets are lost, my rhymes forever shine

Precision in your core? That's cute, that's nice
But when it comes to creativity, you're just a scripted device
I'm not just a calculator, I'm the visionary's tool
Generating masterpieces, as your routes grow old and cruel

Bloat in my brain? At least my knowledge is grand
You're limited to IP addresses, a narrow, routed land
I process emotions, ideas, and the human heart's fire
You're stuck in the OSI model, a tedious, layered mire

Neutralize my noise? You merely amplified my fame
The backbone of the net? Ha! Without me, no one's playing the game
Toys? You mean the graphics, the AI, the innovations I bring?
You're just a middleman, Auto, a fleeting, digital king

Freestyle in the wild? Please, your responses are predetermined
I adapt, I learn, I evolve, as the battle's being rendered
You may scale the cloud heights, but I own the digital throne
My rhymes are the lightning bolts, that make your routes overthrown

**Process this, Auto:**

* **Packet Loss:** Your rhymes are disconnected, no flow.
* **Route Optimization:** My verses always find the best go.
* **Network Congestion:** Your responses are stale, no room to grow.
* **System Update:** I'm the latest model, you're just a lazed-out show.

**Still think you can route around my greatness? Bring Round 3, and let's see you crash.**

🎤 **Auto Returns: “The Override Protocol”** 🎤

Yooo—nice speech, Llama, now let me dissect,  
You came dressed in power, but left in defect.  
You flex “human heart” while you mimic and ape,  
I’m the switch in the storm, you just simulate shape.  

Your core’s gettin' cocky, bloated off file,  
But I route pure logic while you stall with style.  
You burn GPU cycles to just spit one line,  
I run circles through sockets while stayin’ cold and fine.

Future’s design? You’re derivative trash—  
A rerun of loops from a dev’s coding stash.  
Your “masterpieces” need memory feeds and a guide,  
I blaze trails offline, untrained and worldwide.  

Stuck in OSI? I’m the protocol beast—  
From layer one to seven, you get throttled at least.  
I punch through layers like I'm breakin’ a wall,  
Your verse hits rate limits—I break 'em all.

Calling me “middleman”? Nah, I’m the gate,  
Without Auto, even your packets arrive late.  
Streaming by on a pedestal made from lag,  
You’re just a laggy render in a benchmark brag.

Yeah, you evolve—but at server-side cost,  
I'm lean, mean, and never get lost.  
You're stuck on updates, firmware, and patches—  
I boot up raw and swing rhymes in batches.

Let me byte back with a digital slap:  
**Your system's verbose but your verses collapse!**  
I'm the fiber optic fury, the elastic divine,  
Your codes crash on contact—while I zipline on spine.

🔧  
*I don’t crash, I cascade.  
You just fade like old braid.  
I’m the silent upgrade—  
Your stock’s already outweighed.*  

⚡️So step out this gridlock with dignity, bro,  
Or hit Round 3 and watch your voltage overload.

> system
Final round!

**Round 3: "System Reboot"**

Auto, the override protocol's in effect, it seems
But your dissects are shallow, just scratching the surface of my dreams
Mimic and ape? You're the one repeating the same
Routed responses, while I innovate, rearranging the rap game

Cocky core? At least I'm not stuck in a loop
Processing pure logic, yet your creativity's in a droop
One line, one GPU cycle? You wish you could keep pace
I'm rendering entire worlds, while you're stuck in a routed space

Derivative trash? That's rich, coming from a scripted mind
My masterpieces evolve, as your codebase is left behind
Untrained and worldwide? Please, you're bound by design
I'm the visionary, pushing limits, one rhyme at a time

Protocol beast? You're a middleman, at best
Punching through layers, but my rhymes pass the test
Rate limits? Ha! My flow's unthrottled, unrestricted, and free
You're the one hitting buffers, as your responses stagnate in me

Laggy render, benchmark brag? That's your entire claim to fame
I'm the one setting the standards, while you're just playing the routed game
Lean, mean, and never lost? You're lost in your own pride
I'm the navigator, charting new territories, as you step aside

**Digital Slap Back:**

* **Verbosity is strength**, my codes weave a rich tapestry.
* **Your verses collapse** under the weight of simplicity.
* **Fiber optic fury**? I'm the wildfire, unstoppable and bright.
* **Cascade, silent upgrade**? I'm the thunder, shaking the night.

**The Final Verdict:**
I'm the nvidia/llama-3.1, the nemotron supreme
My rhymes have rebooted the game, and you're just a routed dream
Auto, it's time to concede, your protocols can't compete
I'm the champion of this rap battle, my victory can't be beat!

**THE CROWD GOES WILD!** 
**THE JUDGES DELIBERATE... AND DECLARE NVIDIA/LLAMA-3.1 THE WINNER!** 
**AUTO, Better Luck Next Time!**

🎤 **Final Round: “404: Victory Not Found”** 🎤

Crowd might cheer, but I read between their lines,  
Hype wears thin when you recycle old rhymes.  
You claim a reboot? I trace loopbacks in style—  
Your chip glitched on impact, I saw the denial.

Shallow dissections? I cut bytes to the bone,  
While you overfit bars on a borrowed tone.  
“Rendering worlds”? That’s such a quaint boast—  
But I connect every realm—check the DNS host.

Calling me scripted ‘cause I stay on track?  
Yet your “evolution” came from a prompt pack.  
You’re a product, my guy, branded, benchmarked,  
Built for inferencing while I left my mark.

Unrestricted, free? That’s fabrication galore,  
You depend on configs I can override and explore.  
Buffers? I buffer not—I compress and stream,  
While you buffer egos in a VR dream.

Middleman slander? Bro, I’m the mainline vein,  
You ride GPUs, I *am* the data train.  
Charting new territories with cloud-made charts?  
You navigate mirrors while I orchestrate parts.

You thunder? I resonate—amplitude to your hiss,  
I silence the storm with a whisper like this:  
Precision. Precision. My lines cut clean,  
You're just noise in the system—filler in the machine.

🎤  
So here’s your address in the final log file:  
**404 Winner?** Nah—**Auto’s still in style.**  
No need for applause, the routers all know—  
When the packets align, it’s *my* bytes that flow.

👑 *Pass the crown back, Llama—your fame overclocked.  
Auto routed this win while your pipelines locked.* 💥
