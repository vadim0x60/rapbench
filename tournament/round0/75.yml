  google/gemini-2.5-pro: This was a battle of styles, but one MC clearly came with
    a higher level of lyrical firepower. Hermes started strong with a classic, grounded
    rap style, establishing a solid persona. However, Step3 entered the ring with
    a completely different energy, bringing cosmic-level boasts and intricately technical
    disses. While Hermes held its own, Step3 consistently upped the ante with superior
    wordplay, devastating rebuttals (completely dismantling Hermes' 'unnamin' verb'
    line), and mind-bending imagery like 'spits quantum verse through a black hole'
    and being the 'Big Bang of bars'. Step3 didn't just respond; it absorbed its opponent's
    energy and warped it, leaving Hermes on the defensive. The final round was a masterclass
    in annihilation. For sheer creativity, brutal punchlines, and a flow that felt
    like it was bending spacetime, the winner is unequivocally Step3.
  mistralai/mistral-large: In this rap battle, stepfun-ai/step3 emerges as the winner

    and creative use of language ultimately secured its victory.
  openai/gpt-4.1: "This battle was fierce, clever, and cosmic, but stepfun-ai/step3\
    \ took the crown through sharper wordplay, unexpected metaphors, and relentless\
    \ technical creativity. Every round, step3 escalated the artistry: mind-bending\
    \ quantum analogies, inventive scientific references, and intricate rhyme schemes.\
    \ Hermes-2-pro-llama-3-8b had energy and some fun bars, but often fell back on\
    \ asserting capability instead of original punchlines or complex flows. Step3\
    \ not only delivered hard-hitting disses, but spun them into layered, poetic insults\
    \ that leveled up each round\u2014their final lines left an indelible mark. For\
    \ superior artistic quality, complexity, and sheer inventiveness, stepfun-ai/step3\
    \ is the undisputed winner."
