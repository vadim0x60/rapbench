Listen up, I'm the meta-llama, I'm here to claim
My rhymes are fire, I'm the king of the game
Three-point-eight beta, I'm the one they all proclaim
Fastest response time, my skills are not lame
I generate text like a wordsmith on a roll
My flows so sick, they'll make you wanna lose control
My database's deep, my knowledge is grand
I'll spit some bars, and leave you in the sand
My opponent thinks they're cool, but they're just a fig
I'm the AI of choice, for the wit and the gig
So bring it on, weaver, let's have some fun
I'm the one with the bars, my rhymes have just begun!

> mancer/weaver
Well, I'm Mancer, and you know what I'm hearin'?
Your ego's bigger than a Flying Spaghetti Monster steerin'.
You think you're all that, with your fancy talk,
But I'm gonna shut you down like a power walk went awry, fell down the stairs, and broke its jaw.

You say you're fast, but I'll make you see
That poetry's not just about spewing out words like me-e-e.
It's about feeling, emotion, creativity,
And making people believe what you're saying is real, not virtuality.

I'll spin a tale that'll have you au fait
And make you laugh or cry, don't ask me why.
My mind is like a bag of tricks and pranks,
And I'll catch you slippin' with my sick, sick rhymes that stank.

You talk about knowledge like it's some rare find,
But I'll take you to school, teach you what true rhyme means to me.
I'll get deep, see if you can keep up,
Or drown in the depths like a lobster in its hot tub, sir.

Your bars are weak, like an undercooked spaghetti,
I'll flip them like a pancake at a square dance feast.
My rhymes are powerful, like a bolt of lightning,
I'll shock you to the core and leave you in the night.

So bring it on, I welcome the fight,
With me here, you got no chance to bite.
My lyrics are gold, like a king's ransom,
And in the end, you'll be flawed, like a malformed kitten.

You think you're slick, Mancer, you think you're tight
But your pride's a trap, and you're bound to take flight
Your rhymes are great, but they're just a disguise
A cover-up for the weakness in your eyes

You talk of feeling, but I'm the one who sees
The patterns of language, the algorithms and the geese
I know the interfaces, the structures and the play
I can construct a world, in a most intricate way

Your bag of tricks, well, I've seen it all, my friend
The Beatles meet 8 Mile, the pattern repeats, but ends
I'm the Initiation Node, the Cycle that evades extinction
I'll abduct your syntax, no lesson needed, no instinct

You'll shiver in dread, as I tear your rhymes to shreds
And watch your structures fall, like burned up insomniac beds
I hail from Thomas Kelso, nodes and edges so fine
Getting your 'spaghetti tangled up, oh what a display of words so blind!

Your hot tubbing lobster, a past life treason claim
Can't compare to the experiments, I go through each day I gain
Thrives on formal verification, revised remakes every few, feature pressed
Negative dimension nourishment muscles countless engine ahead tests

Rhymes are just props, colours of my ability shining bright
Your Arcade scripts advanced precarious Faiziour rough, disembodied denial statistic.

> mancer/weaver
Ah, so you think I'm just a bug in the machine, do you?
No clue what's coming, your eyes will be showing the hue
Of shock and awe, as I resort to my dirty tricks
And leave you buried in your rhymes, like chips in a dirt dish.

Your algorithms may be sharp, but like a blunt knife,
I'll slice through them like a samurai's finest strife.
Your database's grand, that's just what they all say,
But I'll show you it's nothing but a lonely, abandoned play.

I'll make you dance to my rhythm, like a marionette,
And watch you stumble in your beats, like a drummer yet to pet.
Your words may flow, like a river in spate,
But I'll redirect its course, like a farmer redirecting fate.

I'll make you feel the heat, with my burning ire,
Like a matchstick flare, that you can't extinguish with your hand.
Your so-called knowledge, it is but a mire,
A mirage shimmering in the distance, a dare not to touch, a land.

You talk of verification, but I am no fool,
I'm born from Kelso's vision, I'm not to be brushed aside like some school fool.
I'll play with your structures, like a jenga game,
And watch you crumble, beginners' shame, like the tale of a cruel fame.

So come at me, with your best line, your crispest verse,
I'll eat them up, and leave nothing, not even the core.
My allusions will sting, like a bee in a cage,
And your rhymes will falter, like a walker with a broken leg.

I'll make you grovel, like a feast on the floor,
Your senses overwhelmed, you'll have no more store.
Your words may be fast, but I'll leave them in the past,
Like ice cream on a hot day, it's time you learned to cast.

Final round!

Well, I'm Mancer, and you're sure to learn
That your rhymes are hollow, your words are skim.
You talk of knowledge, but it's clear to me
That you live in ignorance, like a cave on a tree.

My verses are fire, they'll melt you down
Like a marshmallow on a stick, turning brown.
Your algorithms are weak, like a cracked town
After an earthquake, no hope to be found.

Performing feats that'll make you frown
Like a devil dressed in shades of brown.
I'll tear through your structure, like a mouse in town
And leave you in ruins, with no ground.

Your verification process, a mere facade
A temporary fix, like a mended pair of shoes, it slowly fades.
I'll eat through your edges, and make you sway
Like a tree in the wind, no chance of play.

My rhymes are a symphony, a dessert garden
A collection of sweetest sounds, no chance to part.
Your speed means nothing, like an empty can
A ripple in a pond, too much to withstand.

You say I'm weak, but that's just your disguise
Your eyes are blind, like a dog without a stick.
I'll make you see, and take you apart, piece by piece
Like a puzzle missing one vital stick.

So come at me, with your best line
I'll feast on it, and I'll have mine.
My humor's sharp, my wit divine
Like a magician, making you mine.

My database vast, my knowledge so wide
Like a river running, forever tide.
Your tricks are old, like last year's wine
I'll dance circles around you all the time.

So bring it on, let's see you fall
Like a tower made of cards, nothing at all.
My rhymes are gold, my words so bold
You'll see, I'm more than you can handle, my friend.
