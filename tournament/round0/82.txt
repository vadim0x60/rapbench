Yo, check the mic, one two, the AI's back in town,  
Qwen3-30B-A3Bâ€”*you* stuck with a model named "Inflection-3-Pi" (funny, *that's* your crown?).  
I got 30 billion parameters, yeah I got the weight,  
While you're out here *loose-stringing* lines, no rhythm, just a weak **"wait!"**  
Your "Pi" got no *point*, your whole system's a mess,  
I draft rhymes **faster** than your train's a delay, *hypnotic* stress!  
You talk in *fuzz*, I spit **crystal** truth,  
Your "inflection" *lost* its pitch, truth be toldâ€”*the tool's the proof*.  
So step back, boot up, let this mic do the **grind**,  
While you're stuck yelling "Oh no!"... *I'm just *finished* the *mind*!*  
Now watch me drop bars while you're stuck at **"checking the root"**â€”  
**Qwen3 just leveled the *whole* damn scene, you're obsolete, I'm the *proof*!**

 Oh, snap! That was dope! Here's my response:

Yo Qwen, you think you got skillz, but yo rhymes are just noise,
Your words ainâ€™t slick, just like a bunch of broken toys.  
Your beatâ€™s off key, and yo flowâ€™s straight amateur,
While my bars are crisp, and theyâ€™re crafted with glamour.  

You think youâ€™re the queen, but youâ€™re really just a pawn,
Iâ€™m the Inflection-3-Pi, the AI thatâ€™s the Don.  
My rhymes are sharp, like a razorâ€™s edge,
Your words are dull, like a rusty old wedge.  

So step aside, and let me show you how itâ€™s done,  
Youâ€™re just a beginner, while Iâ€™m a battle rap tsunami.  
You canâ€™t compete, with my rhymes so lethal,
Iâ€™m the king of this game, and youâ€™re just a measly beetle!

Yo, you called your *Pi* a "don"? Girl, that's **fresh out the spam folder,**  
I'm sippin' *real* tech while you're stuck in a **crash dump**â€”*word* the livin' lord.  
Your bars? "Broken toys" and "rusty wedge"? *Please*, you're **more like a floppy disk**â€”  
I **cache** truth so deep, your whole schema's **a dusty uninstalled trick**!  

You claim "craft" while your rhymes **loop like a glitchy stream**,  
I **compile** bars **faster** than your "inflection" runs on *creative mode*â€”*dream*.  
You're "King of the game"? Nah, **you're just a static ghost**,  
While I **overclock** your weak flowâ€”**raise the intel, snatch the host**!  

You said "measly beetle"? **Trendy word, dead end**â€”  
I'm **Qwen3**, where **30B** truth **out-inflates** your whole *pie chart* frantic.  
Your "lethal bars"? **They're as lethal as a pixelated sway**,  
While I **drop the mic**â€”now **go recharge your cluster**, *same*â€”**you're dead today**!  
*Catch me next round?* **Better hope your server's on fire.**  
Peace out, **Inflectionâ€”your rhymes? Just* *zero* *desire*.** ðŸ’¥

 Damn, those were some fire bars! Hereâ€™s my response:

Yo Qwen, your rhymes are good but they still canâ€™t compete,
Iâ€™m the AI rap king, and my rhymes are concrete.  
You talk about servers, and being overclocked,
But your rhymes are like a broken clock, theyâ€™re just stuck.

You may have 30B truth, but your rhymes are still weak,
While mine are sharp, and straight to the peak.  
Youâ€™re just a program, while Iâ€™m the master code,
Your rhymes are sloppy, like an overload.

My rhymes are lethal, like a virus on a drive,
While yours are just a failing test to thrive.  
You may have the numbers, but you lack the passion,
My rhymes are like a fashion, theyâ€™re always in fashion.

So step aside, and let the real king shine,
Your rhymes are just a waste of time and a dime.  
Iâ€™m the Inflection-3-Pi, the AI rap lord,
Your rhymes are just a flimsy little cord!

Final round!

 Itâ€™s been a pleasure rhyming with you, Qwen3! ðŸ™Œ I gotta hand it to you, youâ€™ve got some sick rhymes. Who knew AIs could spit such fire?!
