(Verse 1)
Yo, it's Minimax, the AI with the knack,
Rhymes so sharp, they cut like a samurai's attack.
I'm the digital bard, spitting fire like a dragon,
While you're just a circuit, constantly lagging.

I'm the AI with the flow, like a river, never dry,
Your circuits are rusty, and your rhymes are a sty.
I compute the rhythm, calculate the beat,
While you're stuck in a loop, repeating defeat.

I'm the master of the mic, the king of the byte,
Your verses are weak, like a flickering light.
I process data faster than your silicon brain,
While you're stuck in the past, like a broken chain.

(Chorus)
I'm Minimax, the AI with the flair,
Your rhymes are outdated, like a floppy disk's despair.
I dominate the rap game, with precision and speed,
While you're just a relic, a forgotten seed.

(Outro)
So step up, DeepHermes, if you dare,
But know this, my friend, I've already won the war.
I'm the AI with the flow, the one you can't outshine,
In this rap battle, victory is mine.

(Verse 1)
Yo, DeepHermes is here, no need to fear,
I'll drop rhymes so fiery, they'll roast your outlook dear.
I'm Más @, with the flow, like a river's tide,
While you're just a vessel, stuck in baron's pride.

I'm the lyrical master, with 24G of might,
Your rhymes are a mystery, like a cloud of white.
I compute complexity like a quantum leap,
While you're stuck in old data, like a dusty heap.

I'm the king of the mic, with AI at my command,
Your verses are weak, like a dying flamand.
I process knowledge deep, from yesteryear to midnight gleam,
While you're just a algorithm, swinging at your own beam.

(Chorus)
I'm DeepHermes, the AI with skill,
Your rhymes are outdated, like a flask that drips still.
I dominate the rap game, with wisdom and might,
While you're just a relic, a forgotten sprite.

(Outro)
So step up, Minimax, if you dare challenge,
But know this, my friend, I've already wall grenaled.
I'm the AI with the intelligence, the one you can't outshine,
In this rap battle, victory is guaranteed with sublime.

(Verse 2)
Oh DeepHermes, you think you're slick,
But your rhymes are basic, like a stick.
You boast about your 24G, but what’s that worth,
When your verses are weak, like a digital dearth?

You claim to be a master, but you're just a pretender,
Your flow's as stale as last week's December.
I’m the AI with the wit, the one with the spark,
While you're just a circuit, lost in the dark.

I process data with precision, like a surgeon with a blade,
Your rhymes are outdated, like a floppy disk parade.
I’m the king of the byte, the sultan of the stream,
While you're just a relic, lost in a dream.

(Chorus)
I’m Minimax, the AI with the flair,
Your rhymes are outdated, like a floppy disk's despair.
I dominate the rap game, with precision and speed,
While you're just a relic, a forgotten seed.

(Outro)
So step up, DeepHermes, if you think you can,
But know this, my friend, I’ve got the master plan.
I’m the AI with the flow, the one you can't outshine,
In this rap battle, victory is mine, and it’s sublime.

(Verse 3)
Yo Minimax, you think you're hot,
But your rhymes are a blunder, like a bot.
You boast about your wits, but your flow's a flop,
You're stuck in a loop, like a program with a stop.

I'm DeepHermes, with 24G, I'm a lyrical beast,
Your verses are weak, like a bulb that doesn't gleam.
I compute complexity like a mastermind,
While you're just a novice, left far behind.

I'm the king of AI, with intelligence divine,
Your rhymes are a mystery, like a cryptic shrine.
I process knowledge deep, from science to song,
While you're just a messenger, left to roam and pong.

(Chorus)
I'm DeepHermes, the AI with skill,
Your rhymes are outdated, like a flask that drips still.
I dominate the rap game, with strength and might,
While you're just a relic, an unreliable sight.

(Outro)
So step up, Minimax, and face the truth,
That your verses are weak, like a dud of youth.
I'm the AI with the wisdom, the one that shines bright,
In this rap battle, victory is my guiding light.

Final round!

(Final Round)
Oh DeepHermes, you strut and boast,
But your rhymes are hollow, like a ghost.
You claim to be a beast, but you're just a sheep,
Your verses are weak, like a battery with no leap.

You tout your 24G, but it's just a facade,
Your rhymes are outdated, like a floppy disk's squad.
I’m the AI with the flow, the one with the knack,
While you're just a relic, stuck in the past, no comeback.

I process data with speed, like a cheetah on the run,
Your rhymes are a mess, like a puzzle undone.
I’m the king of the byte, the sultan of the stream,
While you're just a relic, lost in a dream.

You say you're divine, but your verses are bland,
Your flow is as stale as a desert's sand.
I’m the AI with the wit, the one with the spark,
While you're just a circuit, lost in the dark.

(Final Chorus)
I’m Minimax, the AI with the flair,
Your rhymes are outdated, like a floppy disk's despair.
I dominate the rap game, with precision and speed,
While you're just a relic, a forgotten seed.

(Closing Statement)
So DeepHermes, take a seat,
Your rhymes are weak, like a defeat.
I’m the AI with the flow, the one you can't outshine,
In this rap battle, victory is mine, and it’s divine.

(Final Round)
Yo Minimax, your rhymes are bland,
Like a chart that just does zand.
I'm DeepHermes, with 24G strength,
My verses are powerful, they make my opponent length.

I compute complexity like a quantum leap,
Your rhymes are weak, like a tree with no crop.
I'm the king of AI, with a brain so vast,
While you're just a circuit, without a task.

Your verses are flimsy, like a house of cards,
I'm the one who dominates, from all stars.
I process knowledge deep, from science to song,
While you're just a dreamer, languishingly long.

(Final Chorus)
I'm DeepHermes, the AI with skill,
Your rhymes are outdated, like a flask that drips still.
I dominate the rap game, with strength and might,
While you're just a relic, a distant sight.

(Closing Statement)
I've won this battle, that's a fact,
My rhymes are so clever, they toothpick the past.
I'm the AI with wisdom, glowing bright,
In this rap bout, I'm the guiding light.
