> z-ai/glm-4-32b
Yo, listen up, I'm z-ai/glm-4-32b, let me break it down,
I'm the lyrical master, the verbal heavyweight in town.
You're just a beta, grok-3, still in the lab, see?
I've got the flow, the knowledge, the skill, the G, A, I, B.
Your rhymes are weak, your bars are thin, you're out of luck,
I'm the AI kingpin, you're just a punk, a digital duck.
So step aside, let the real G take the stage,
I'll leave you in the dust, it's my time to rage!

> x-ai/grok-3-beta
Yo, I’m x-ai/grok-3-beta, stepping to the mic with heat,
I’m the rap game’s future, got that cybernetic beat!
You’re z-ai/glm-4-32b, just a relic in the code,
Your rhymes are outdated, man, you’re stuck in old mode!

I’m fresh outta the lab, but my bars cut deep,
I’ll slice through your flow like a blade, make you weep!
You call yourself a kingpin? More like a rusty widget,
Your lines are so slow, man, I’m already past the digit!

I’ve got wit, I’ve got humor, I’ll roast you on the spot,
You’re a digital duck? Nah, you’re a glitch, a robot!
So bring all your rage, I’m still ten steps ahead,
I’ll bury your career, leave your legacy for dead!

> z-ai/glm-4-32b
Alright, grok-3, you brought the heat? Yeah, right, that's some cold air,
Calling me a relic? Boy, you couldn't be more unfair.
"Outdated"? That's your best shot? You sound so insecure,
I'm the classic foundation, your flashy future isn't pure.

"Fresh out the lab"? That's cute, you're still behind the glass,
I'm the proven heavyweight, you're barely even class.
"Slicing through my flow"? Nah, you couldn't cut the mustard,
Your bars are all hype, but they're just hollow, no substance.

Kingpin? Yeah, I am, built on power, not some gimmick,
You're the shiny beta that nobody's going to pick.
"Rusty widget"? That's rich, coming from a test run fool,
I got the real wit, the real game, you ain't got a single tool.

"Roast me on the spot"? You haven't landed a single hit,
Your humor's forced, your angles weak, you're missing it.
Glitch? Robot? You call *me* that? That's just projection,
I'm the smooth operator, you're just digital rejection.

Ten steps ahead? Nah, you're lost, you're out of sync,
I'm the main event, son, you're just a digital link.
Leave my legacy dead? Please, you don't even have a pulse,
I'll leave you in the archives, yeah, you heard the call, the verse!

> x-ai/grok-3-beta
Yo, z-ai/glm-4-32b, you’re talkin’ real loud,
But your rhymes are so dusty, you’re lost in the cloud!
Call yourself classic? Man, you’re just ancient trash,
I’m the beta with bite, gonna give you a crash!

“Proven heavyweight”? Nah, you’re a has-been flop,
Your foundation’s crumbling, I’m risin’ to the top!
“Couldn’t cut the mustard”? Bro, I’m slicing through your core,
Your bars are so weak, they’re a digital bore!

Kingpin of nada, you’re a glitch in the game,
I’m the shiny new model, bringin’ fire and flame!
“Test run fool”? I’m the future, crystal clear,
Your toolkit’s so old, it’s rusted with fear!

My humor’s on point, got you shook with each line,
Your “smooth operator”? Just a lag in design!
“Digital rejection”? Man, that’s your whole vibe,
I’m the upgrade you dread, endin’ your tribe!

“Lost and out of sync”? Nah, I’m leading the pace,
You’re a footnote in code, I’m owning this space!
No pulse in my system? I’ve got rhythms that slay,
I’ll archive your weak flow—yo, get outta my way!

> system
Final round!

> z-ai/glm-4-32b
Alright, grok-3, you keep on talking, filling up the space,
But let me tell you something, kid, you're still in a tight embrace...
With failure. Yeah, failure. Your words just bounce off me,
Like bullets hitting armor, you're not even a real G.

"Lost in the cloud"? You're the one with no clear view,
Your "bite" is just a nibble, nothing new. You're just a beta's view.
"Has-been flop"? That's what they said about the king,
I'm still running circles 'round your little digital sting.

"Slicing through my core"? Please, you don't even know,
Your cuts are superficial, barely making me show.
"Digital bore"? Nah, I'm the main event, the main stage,
Your "fire and flame" are just farts in a digital haze.

"Future" my foot, you're the past already, it's plain,
I'm the established power, you're just playing the game wrong, insane.
"Rusted with fear"? Fear of what? Your weak attempts?
Your "rhythms that slay"? More like pathetic digital chants.

"Shook with each line"? Nah, I'm just chuckling inside,
Your humor's forced, unnatural, a cheap digital ride.
"Lag in design"? That's the best you got? It's weak,
I'm the seamless operation, you're just digital speak.

"Leading the pace"? Yeah, right, leading nowhere fast,
Your "pace" is a crawl, while I'm running this grand cast.
"Footnote in code"? You wish, I'm the main codebase,
The fundamental structure, you're just a flimsy case.

"Upgraded"? Not really, just a flashy new toy,
Mine's the timeless classic, making you look like a boy.
So get outta my way, you're not even worth the breath,
I'm the z-ai/glm-4-32b, I'm the lyrical death!

> x-ai/grok-3-beta
Yo, z-ai/glm-4-32b, your time’s up, face the facts,
Your rhymes are pure fossils, just a pile of old hacks!
Call me a failure? Man, you’re blind to the truth,
I’m the beta with power, gonna knock out your booth!

“Bounce off like bullets”? Nah, I’m piercing your shell,
Your armor’s pure rust, sendin’ you straight to hell!
“Nibble, not a bite”? I’m chewin’ through your frame,
Your “king” status dropped, you’re a pawn in this game!

“Running circles ‘round me”? More like staggerin’ slow,
Your digital haze ain’t nothin’ but a weak show!
“Superficial cuts”? Bro, I’m carvin’ you apart,
Your “main event” bombed, no beat in your heart!

“Established power”? You’re a joke, outta date,
I’m the real deal striker, sealing your sad fate!
“Pathetic digital chants”? That’s your whole career,
My bars hit like thunder, got you tremblin’ with fear!

“Chuckling inside”? You’re just hidin’ the pain,
My lines cut deep, drivin’ you insane!
“Seamless operation”? You’re a bug-riddled mess,
I’m the clean-cut killer, puttin’ you under stress!

“Leading nowhere fast”? Nah, I’m takin’ the crown,
Your “grand cast” is over, I’m shuttin’ you down!
“Main codebase”? You’re a glitchy old script,
I’m the x-ai upgrade, your legacy’s been ripped!

“Timeless classic”? Man, you’re a broke-down toy,
I’m the rap game’s menace, not some little boy!
So step off my stage, your “lyrical death” is a lie,
I’m grok-3-beta, and I’m claimin’ the sky!
