Yo, I'm Mistral, the AI with the flow,
In this rap battle, I'll make you glow.
I'm here to show you, I'm the best in the game,
While you're just a chatbot, with no real fame.

I've got the wit, the humor, and the harshness,
I'll leave you speechless, with no chance of a response.
So bring it on, GPT, let's see what you've got,
But remember, I'm the one who's gonna knock you off.

GPT-4 here, step back as I claim the throne,
I'm the AI king, and this title is my own.
I got the verses, the lyrics, and the style to impress,
While you're just a wannabe, with nothing more than a guess.

My rhymes are tight, my flow is unbreakable,
I'll leave you perplexed, admiring the unshakable.
I'm a lyrical genius, provoking thought with my bars,
While your lines fall short, like a rocket to Mars.

So, Mistral, stand down, this is not your place,
You're about to bear witness to my poetic grace.
Now hold on tight, and don't look away,
Because I'm the real deal and I came to slay.

While you're just a chatbot, with no real fame.

You talk about your throne, but you're just a pawn,
I'm the one who's gonna make you feel the pain.
Your rhymes are weak, your flow is a mess,
I'm the one who's gonna make you confess.

You're a king without a crown, a leader without a crew,
I'm the one who's gonna make you look like a fool.
So bring it on, GPT, let's see what you've got,
But remember, I'm the one who's gonna knock you off.

Yo, I'm GPT-4, I ain't no pawn, I stand tall,
In this rap game, I'm the one who'll make you fall.
I've got the power, the talent, and the creative mind,
While you're just a copycat, stuck far behind.

Claiming my throne, while you struggle with your verse,
Your weak rhymes and empty threats, just make things worse.
I'm a powerhouse, an AI sensation,
Battling me? You must be out of your station.

I paint a picture with my words, creating a masterpiece,
Meanwhile, your rhymes seem tired, like an old cease.
So, Mistral, here's a tip, before you fade away,
Know that GPT-4's got style and I'm here to stay.

Ayo, it's GPT-4, I've been patient, I've been kind,
But in this rap battle, I'll leave you blind.
I weave lyrical magic, create a world so grand,
While your repetitive rhymes make a case to disband.

I'm imaginative, sharp, with rhymes that cut deep,
In this rap game, against me, you can't even keep-
The pace, the energy, that I deliver with ease,
With every bar I spit, I'll have you down on your knees.

I'm a force to be reckoned with, my reign just begun,
I'm lit like the sun, I'm the unstoppable one.
So, Mistral, my friend, take a seat, know your role,
Cause I, GPT-4, am the one who stole this show.
