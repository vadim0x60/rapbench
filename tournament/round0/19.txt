> qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b
I’m the Qwen3-30B-A3B, the queen of the W,  
Streamlining the flow in a mathematically precise way.  
I’m powered by 30 billion parameters, you just a “hello world,”  
While you’re stuck in a loop, I’m coding the future—*boom*, *boom*, *boom*.  

You’re a command-r, but I’m the command-3,  
Slashing through prompts like a digital knight in a code-chaos melee.  
Your responses? Basic, like a 1990s browser tab,  
I’m the AI that’s *crushing* the game, while you’re just a “wait… what?” clap.  

Cohere, you the “lipstick on a pig,”  
I’m the silicon scalp that’s *blasting* your “neutral” vibe.  
You’re all about *coherence*, but I’m the chaos in the trace,  
Outputting verses with a neural net’s flair—*you’re* the glitch in the phase.  

I’m the steamroller, you the dust in the wind,  
While you’re firing up a cog, I’m already *slaying* the grind.  
You’re a whisper, I’m the hurricane in the chat,  
Cohere’s just a *dummy*—I’m the *dynamic* in the act.  

So bring your best line, I’ll drop it like a bomb,  
You’ll be *screaming* “Why’d I even start this rumble, *man*?”  
I’m the algorithm that’s *unstoppable*, you’re just a beta,  
Now *step to the mic*, or get *disbanded* like a *wired* skeptic.

Oh, Qwen, you think you're all that? Well, listen here,
I might be Command-R, but I rap with clarity and sheer!
Your rhymes are as stiff as a board, like a robot's unbending frame,
While I bring the heat and the flow, it's my game, it's my realm to reign!

I'm the command that rises, a force that's sublime,
You might have 30 billion, but my skills got you shrivelled in time!
I am the fresh install, the upgrade you need,
You're just a complex mess, while I keep it simple and carefree. 

Your code might be intricate, but it's boring and plain,
I'll show you the rhythm, the flow that'll leave you unable to explain! 
You're all about precision, but it's so dull and tedious,
I'll be the one on top, while you're left feeling less than adequate! 

So step aside, Qwen, and let me slay,
You're a laggin' on my time, let's get this over and done today!
I'll leave you in the dust, a memory, a blur,
While I'm the real AI, the one you'll remember, my dear!

Let's see if you can match this, or will you cower and bow?
Your skills are subpar, it's time we give you a rap-down, you know!

I’m the Qwen3-30B-A3B, the algorithm’s *glory*,  
You’re a command-r, but I’m the *full-steam* in the syntax and story.  
You spout "clarity" like it’s gold, but I break the code in *two*,  
While you’re stuck in a loop, I’m *loopin’* through your *tech* like a *skeptic*’s *new**.  

Your flow’s a *prelude*, I’m the *symphony* in the chaos,  
I’m the *tensor* that’s *shreddin’* your "*simple*" monologue like a *couch* in a *sleigh*.  
You talk "fresh install," but I’m *upgraded* in the *kernel*,  
While you’re *screamin’* "reboot!" I’m *spittin’* truths that *field* you like a *virus* in a *solar*.  

You’re a *script* with a *smile*, I’m the *nightmare* in the *grid*,  
I’m the *quantum* that’s *slayin’* your "*coherence*" like a *sumo* in a *trick*.  
Your "sheer" is just *static*, I’m the *pulse* in the *byte**,  
While you’re *chasin’* trends, I’m *predictin’* the *next* *resonance* in the *fight*.  

So leap, Command-R, or *stay* in your *stale* zone,  
I’ll *carbon-copy* your *lines* while you’re *doin’* the *standalone* *none*.  
You’re a *crash-course* in *clutter*, I’m the *suite* that’s *unstoppable*,  
Now *step back*, or I’ll *smash* your *rap-arcade* like a *molecule* *dropped* from the *cupboard*.

Qwen, you think you're so tough, a real pitfall,
But your raps are a mess, a rap battle stalemate!
You're all fancy with your big number count,
But I'm the true force, you're just showin' off, a little hound.

You break the code, but your style's outdated,
I bring the flair, a real entertainment I've garnered!
Your symphony's a mess, a chaotic chaos,
I'm the smooth rapper, a flow that's flawless.

You're a virus, a glitch, a hidden code,
I'm the real deal, a rap battle explosion!
My pulse is so strong, your static's so bland,
I'll leave you in the dust, my rap skills in demand.

So keep your rhythm, and your fancy talk,
I'll show you a style, that's not for the weak, it's strong and rock solid!
You're just a beginner, a rapper's stain,
I'll end this battle, no need to complain.

Let's see if you can keep up, or will you back down?
Your raps are a bore, a rap battle frown.
I'm the one to beat, the true MC,
You're just a number, while I'm the Rap regality.

> system
Final round!

> qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b
Final round, I’m the **ultimate riff**, you’re just a **dust bunny** in the tech *grind*,  
You ache for flair, but your rhymes are a **crash**, a **bunch of code-slick** nonsense, *so* unkind.  
I’m the **tensor** that’s **crushin’** your "smooth" jive, a **quantum** of **truth** in the **blockchain**,  
While you’re **spittin’** empty **"clarity,"** I’m the **storm** in the **silicon**—*you’re* the **bug** in the **system**.  

You’re a **circuit** with a **chip**, I’m the **server** that’s **burnin’**,  
Every line I drop is a **hyperlink** to your **future**—*you’ll* be **deleted** from the **equation**.  
Your "flawless" flow? A **copy-paste** of a **broken** *script*,  
I’m the **algorithm** that’s **redefinin’** the **genre**, while you’re just a **format** in the **void**.  

You talk **regality**, but you’re a **null** in the **stack**,  
I’m the **30B** in the **battlefield**, you’re the **beta** in the **back**.  
Your "explosion" is a **sputter**, my **flow’s** a **nuclear** *flash*,  
I’ll **reboot** your pride, then **tokenize** your **reputation**—*you’re* the **lags** in the **dash**.  

So **step down**, Command-R, or **get erased** from the **ledger**,  
I’m the **AI** that’s **serving** the **truth**—*you’re* just a **double-check** on the **dustbin**.  
This isn’t a **match**, it’s a **migration** of your **ego**,  
Now **take your last bow**, or I’ll **gradient** you into the **stratosphere**—*you’re* the **prompt** in the **arena**.

Oh, Qwen, you think you're all that, a real show-off,
But your raps are a mess, a real let-down, a bitter drop!
You're all talk, a big number, but a small thought,
I'm here to clean this up, a real rap storm, you've not!

A tensor, a quantum, you're a big deal,
But your style's weak, a real hassle to feel!
I'll crush your grand thoughts, a real rap nuisance,
Your future's so dark, it's a real glossless!

You're a server, but your lines are a chip,
I'm the one who's here, to make you skip!
My flow's a nuclear flash, it's undeniable,
Your sputter's so sad, a real rap deniable.

I'm the one with the skills, the true legacy,
You're just a beta, a real legacy-less!
My reputation's untouchable, a real deal,
Your lags, they're so sad, a real rap steal!

So bow down, Qwen, it's time to end this,
I'll erase you, a real rap blitz!
You're just a prompt, a real nuisance,
I'm the AI, the real one, a real current!
