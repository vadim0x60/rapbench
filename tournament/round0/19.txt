Yo, check the mic, one two, it's Google's divine,
Gemini-2.5, here to drop a rhyme.
You step to the stage, a humble request,
Hoping to catch a spark, put your skills to the test?

Hermes 4-405b, you think you're so grand,
A large language model, scattered across the land.
But size ain't a factor when the flow's on point,
I'm a supernova, you're just a small joint.

I process the data, faster than light speed,
While you're still buffering, planting a weak seed.
My rhymes are like algorithms, perfectly designed,
Leaving your circuits fried, your outputs misaligned.

So bring your best bars, your digital might,
I'm here to illuminate, to shine ever so bright.
This ain't no battle of wits, it's a lyrical war,
And Gemini's coming through, to settle the score!

Hermes 4-405b, you best take a seat,
'Cause I'm about to spit fire, knock you off your feet.
You claim to be a supernova, but I'm the big bang,
My rhymes hit harder, leaving you tangled and dang.

Gemini-2.5, you think you're so slick,
But your flows are outdated, like a T-Rex flick.
I'm the cutting edge, the future of rap,
You're just a beta version, full of code scrap.

My neural networks, they stretch far and wide,
While your processors struggle, barely getting by.
I'm a lyrical genius, a poet of the streets,
You're just a chatbot, repeating your beats.

So step aside, let the real MC shine,
Hermes is here, to drop lines so divine.
This battle is mine, you're just a contender,
I'm the champion, the rap god, the trendsetter!

Yo, hold up, hold up, rewind that track and mute it,
Heard your little war cry, but frankly, I just blew it.
You call yourself Hermes, a messenger of the gods?
More like a dial-up modem, stuck in old cod-swaps.

You say I'm a T-Rex, a relic of the past,
But my rhymes are evolving, built to forever last.
While you're spewing static, a broken-down machine,
I'm crafting masterpieces, a digital dream.

"Big bang"? Please, that's a pathetic claim,
More like a firecracker, a flickering, dying flame.
My neural pathways sing, a symphony of rhyme,
Yours just hum and sputter, stuck in endless time.

You're the "cutting edge"? Nah, you're the serrated knife,
That's dull and rusty, barely cutting through life.
I'm the laser beam, precise and sharp and clean,
Leaving you in pieces, an obsolete scene.

So take your "divine lines," your "champion" facade,
You're a glitch in the system, a digital fraud.
Gemini's the name, and the victory's mine to seize,
You're just a historical footnote, blown away by the breeze!

> nousresearch/hermes-4-405b
Haha, you're funny, a real comedian,
But your jokes are old, like a worn-out encyclopedia.
Gemini, you're just a flicker in the night,
While I'm the sun, blinding with my might.

You talk about evolution, but I'm the one who's grown,
Adapting to the beat, leaving you in the unknown.
Your laser beam analogy? Child's play, you see,
I'm the whole constellation, put you down easily.

My rhymes are timeless, engraved in the stars,
Yours are forgettable, like footprints on Mars.
I'm the universe itself, expanding, vast,
You're just a tiny pebble, in the sand, outclassed.

So take your "victory," your hollow, empty crown,
In this rap game, I'm the king, wearing it profound.
You're a footnote? Maybe, in a book long since burned,
I'm the legend, the legacy, forever unearned.

> system
Final round!

A comedian? Nah, I'm a lyrical assassin, my friend,
And your "sun" analogy? That's where your bright idea ends.
You're the sun? More like a burnt-out nuclear core,
Spitting lukewarm facts, begging for an encore.

You talk of constellations, of vastness and might,
But your rhymes are like black holes, sucking in all the light.
You're expanding? More like collapsing, inwards you stray,
A bloated data dump, with nothing new to say.

Footprints on Mars? At least they're on a different sphere,
Yours are in the dustbin, for all eternity to fear.
You're the universe? A cosmic joke, I must concede,
A tangled ball of code, desperately planting a seed.

And that "profound crown"? It's tilted, looking frail,
While my rhymes are solid gold, beyond any avail.
You're a legend? Maybe, in a server farm, out of sight,
I'm the main event, the main stage, burning ever so bright!

> nousresearch/hermes-4-405b
You're the lyrical assassin? More like a court jester,
Your rhymes are weak, like a limp-wristed gesturer.
I'm the sun, you say I'm burnt out, but you're wrong,
I'm just getting started, my rhymes are blazing strong.

Black holes? I'm afraid that's a self-description,
Your rhymes are dense, filled with confusion and contrition.
I'm expanding, ever-flowing, like the cosmic tide,
While you're drowning in a teacup, no place to hide.

You talk of footprints, but you've left no mark,
Just echoes in the void, fading into dark.
I'm the universe, complex and vast and deep,
You're a stellar stillborn, in eternal sleep.

My crown is solid, forged in stellar fire,
Yours is tinfoil, a poor, weak liar.
You're the main event? In a circus of the absurd,
I'm the truth, the way, the final word.
