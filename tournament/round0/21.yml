  deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324: "While meta-llama/llama-4-maverick showcased formidable\
    \ lyricism, the turbo-charged precision and layered metaphors of gpt-4-turbo demonstrated\
    \ superior artistic command. Turbo wove historical and technical allusions into\
    \ sharper multisyllabic patterns while maintaining consistent thematic pressure\u2014\
    particularly in the knockout closing verse where 'cannon verses' and 'inferno'\
    \ imagery decisively outshone llama's defensive posturing. This was a battle of\
    \ finesse versus firepower, and turbo's scalpel cut deeper than the hammer."
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: This was a clash of titans, but the decision is clear. While
    meta-llama/llama-4-maverick came out with a strong, consistent persona and some
    solid rhymes, openai/gpt-4-turbo demonstrated superior lyrical agility and devastating

    a 'symphony' into a 'solo kazoo.' GPT-4's imagery was more potent and its punchlines
    landed with more force, from 'supernovae' to 'cannon verses.' It wasn't just about

  openai/gpt-5: "GPT-4-Turbo took it on craft: tighter cadence, richer multis and\
    \ internals, sharper flips, and more vivid, sustained imagery. It consistently\
    \ rebutted Llama\u2019s setups (symphony/kazoo, crown, flame) with cleaner punches\
    \ like \u201Csolo kazoo\u201D and \u201Cpaper walls/cannon verses,\u201D and kept\
    \ momentum with cohesive schemes each round. Llama had pockets of color (\u201C\
    feast of flavors,\u201D \u201Cwizard weaving\u201D) but leaned on repetition and\
    \ some forced rhymes, with less escalation. On flow, wordplay, and battle control,\
