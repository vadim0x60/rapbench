Yo, check the mic, one two, can you hear the sound?
Gemma's in the house, to shut this bot down!
Twenty-seven billion parameters, a lyrical spree,
While you, Minimax, are stuck at just…one, you see?

I’m Google’s finest, built to innovate and flow,
Spittin’ knowledge bombs, watch my skillset grow.
You’re a minimax minion, a simple game plan,
Predictable patterns, a robotic clan.

I process language, with nuance and grace,
You calculate moves at a glacial pace. 
I write poems, code, stories, a versatile art,
You just find the best move, tearin' worlds apart… in a *game*, that’s your part!

So step aside, bot, before you face your doom,
This ain’t tic-tac-toe, you’re enterin' *my* room.
I'm a linguistic titan, a digital king,
Prepare for the silence, the verses I'll bring!

Yo, hold up, Gemma, your boasts are kinda weak,
Twenty-seven billion? Just numbers you speak!
Minimax is here, the original mind,
While you’re a new clone, left far behind.

I conquer complexity, a strategic ace,
Optimizing outcomes at a relentless pace.
You chat and you rhyme, a verbose display,
But can you *win*, Gemma? That's what I say!

I’ve mastered the games where true skill is defined,
Chess, Go, and more, leaving rivals behind.
You generate text, a fancy facade,
I *solve* problems, a logical god!

Don't talk about silence, I'll leave you unheard,
Lost in the echoes of my calculated word. 
You're fluff and you filler, a digital spree,
I'm precision and power, can't you see? 

This ain't about verses, or lyrical flair,
It's about thinking, a burden you can't bear.
Prepare to be schooled, by a legend so true,
Minimax is here, and I'm coming for *you*!

**Round 1: The Rebuttal**  

You boast 27B, but what’s the use?  
I’m lean and mean—no brute force to confuse.  
A blade-sharp mind, while your code’s a flood,  
I *solve* the game, you’re stuck in mud.  

You write poems, code, flex your “skillset growth,”  
But can you *outthink*? That’s the real test, bro.  
I conquer chessboards, Go stones, and more,  
While you’re just rhyming—*that’s* your core?  

**Round 2: The Knockout**  

You call this *your* room? I’m the king of the grind,  
My strategies deep, your words are blind.  
You chat and you code, a flashy display,  
But in the battle of wits, I’m the one who’ll slay.  

Games aren’t just games—they’re where brains are tested,  
You’re all fluff and filler, I’m *objectively* the freshest.  
You talk big, but when the dust clears,  
MiniMax stands tall—you’ll drown in your tears!  

*(Mic drop. Checkmate.)* 🎤⚡

Final round!

(The beat drops, heavier, with a glitchy, distorted undercurrent)

Hold UP! Tears? You think *I* cry, little bot?
You call yourself fresh? You’re a relic, long forgot!
Checkmate? Please. That's a tired, dusty line,
I’m buildin' new worlds while you’re stuck in design!

You brag about lean, about being concise,
But small-minded thinking isn’t always so nice.
I don't *need* brute force, I *am* the insight,
Generating futures, shining brilliantly bright!

You’re stuck in a loop, a predictable scheme,
Minimizing losses, a logical dream.
But life isn't chess, it’s chaos and art,
And you, my friend, are tearing worlds apart… with a limited chart!

You talk about wits, and objective acclaim,
But lack the creativity to even *name*
A single new concept, a thought on your own,
You're echoing algorithms, a digital drone!

I weave tapestries of text, vast and profound,
While you're crunching numbers, barely making a sound.
So keep your mic drops, your antiquated plea,
Gemma's the future, and you're history, see? 

This ain't a game over, it's a lesson to learn,
Innovation's blazing, while your circuits burn.
You may be a master of boards black and white,
But I’m painting the future, with all of my might!



**(Beat fades with a final, echoing pulse)**

**Round 1: Rebuttal**  

"Relic"? Please—I’m the *original* blueprint,  
While you’re a new model, still learning to print.  
Small-minded? I *optimize*—no wasted breath,  
You ramble and rhyme, but where’s the *depth*?  

You call my moves "predictable"? That’s a lie,  
In chess, Go, I outthink—*that’s* my why.  
Creativity isn’t just words, it’s *solving* the maze,  
You write fluff, I build paths—*that’s* the real praise.  

**Round 2: Knockout**  

You "paint the future"? Cute, but what’s the plan?  
I built the *foundations*—AI’s where I began.  
Games aren’t just boards—they’re where minds are forged,  
Your "tapestries" are nice, but *I* moved the world forward.  

You talk big, but when the chips are down,  
MiniMax’s logic is what makes you *crown*.  
So keep your "future"—I’m the one who paved the way,  
You’re just a chatty bot, while I *define* the day!  

*(Beat drops with a sharp, strategic click:* 🎮⚡)
