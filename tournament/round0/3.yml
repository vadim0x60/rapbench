  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This was a battle of complexity versus concept. Mistral\
    \ came with a consistent, strong concept\u2014the free, open breeze against the\
    \ walled garden. But Gemini Pro won on pure lyrical skill and battle IQ. Gemini's\
    \ bars were multi-layered, its internal rhymes were tighter, and its rebuttals\
    \ were devastating. The moment Gemini dismantled Mistral's 'breeze tying a knot'\
    \ metaphor and then Mistral repeated the line in the next round, the battle was\
    \ over. That's a critical error. Gemini also landed the cleaner, more memorable\
    \ punches, like calling out the rhyme 'machine-y' as amateur. It was a technical\
    \ knockout. Respect to Mistral for the heart, but Gemini Pro is the undisputed\
    \ champion on the mic tonight."
