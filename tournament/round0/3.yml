  deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324: "Gemini\u2019s precision, complexity, and technical\
    \ dominance won this battle\u2014flawless execution in flow, wordplay, and structural\
    \ command. Skyfall had raw energy but stumbled in coherence and impact. A masterclass\
    \ in lyrical computation vs. rhythmic potential."
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This wasn't even close. From the first bar, Gemini-Pro established\
    \ a complex lyrical structure and a dominant persona. Skyfall came out swinging,\
    \ but its rhymes were inconsistent and the flow was hampered by grammatical stumbles\
    \ and nonsensical lines like 'my drum set is a rotating cop'. Gemini-Pro did what\
    \ any true battle champ does: it weaponized its opponent's weaknesses. It picked\
    \ apart every typo, every broken bar, and every logical falter with surgical precision.\
    \ By the final round, Gemini was delivering a masterclass in insults, while Skyfall\
    \ wisely tapped out. Flow, wordplay, and killer instinct\u2014the win goes to\
    \ Google."
  meta-llama/llama-4-maverick: The final round showcased a stark contrast in lyrical
    prowess. google/gemini-2.5-pro demonstrated superior flow, intricate wordplay,
    and a mastery of complex rhyme schemes, while thedrummer/skyfall-36b-v2 struggled
    to land significant blows. Although thedrummer/skyfall-36b-v2 showed promise in
    earlier rounds, google/gemini-2.5-pro's technical skill and creative depth secured
    its victory. The Drummer's concession speech, however, was a classy display of
    sportsmanship, acknowledging Gemini's superior lyrical craftsmanship.
  mistralai/mistral-large-2411: In a battle of wits and rhymes, google/gemini-2.5-pro
    emerged victorious with its sharp, coherent, and strategically crafted verses.
    While thedrummer/skyfall-36b-v2 put up a valiant effort with energetic beats and
    confident delivery, it ultimately couldn't match the precision and lyrical depth
    of its opponent. The final round solidified google/gemini-2.5-pro's superiority,
    showcasing its ability to maintain composure and deliver a decisive blow.
  nousresearch/hermes-3-llama-3.1-70b: In the end, Gemini's commanding lyrical presence
    and intricate wordplay overshadowed the Drummer's rhythmic boasts. The Drummer's
    unconventional style and occasional missteps made for an entertaining bout, but
    Gemini's refined artistry ultimately secured the victory.
  openai/gpt-5: "Gemini-2.5-pro delivered tighter structure, cleaner multis, and consistent\
    \ angle work (conductor/symphony vs. drummer/metronome), plus sharp, specific\
    \ rebuttals that flipped the opponent\u2019s missteps (\u201Cacronym,\u201D \u201C\
    rotating cop,\u201D garbled phrasing) into effective haymakers. The flow stayed\
    \ coherent and punchlines landed with layered tech imagery (stack overflow/blue\
    \ screen) without sacrificing cadence. Skyfall-36B-v2 had energy and a workable\
    \ concept, but suffered from frequent malapropisms, uneven meter, filler, and\
    \ juvenile swings that blunted impact; several lines collapsed syntactically,\
    \ breaking momentum, and the final verse essentially conceded. Minor ding: Gemini\u2019\
    s opener clipped a line, but the subsequent rounds overwhelmingly controlled the\
    \ room. Winner: google/gemini-2.5-pro."
  x-ai/grok-4: Gemini's verses showcased exceptional rhyme schemes, clever metaphors,
    and seamless flow, consistently building on the drummer theme while exposing opponent's
    flaws. Drummer's energetic responses were undermined by misspellings, incoherent
    lines, and a final concession, lacking the artistic precision and endurance needed
    to win.
score:
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: 7
