closing_statements:
  deepseek/deepseek-chat: In the final showdown, Ernie brought the heat with razor-sharp
    wit, precision in delivery, and a commanding presence that outshone Qwen's efforts.
    Their rhymes were not only technically sound but also packed with confidence and
    lyrical depth, dismantling Qwen's defenses with ease. While Qwen showed resilience
    and creativity, Ernie's performance was undeniably dominant, solidifying their
    victory in this rap battle. The art of hip hop thrives on skill, flow, and impact,
    and Ernie delivered all three in spades. Congratulations to Baidu's Ernie 4.5,
    the undisputed champion of this clash!
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: This was a heavy-hitter matchup. ERNIE came out swinging,
    dropping big numbers and powerful imagery like a 'shark through the night'. The
    energy was undeniable. However, Qwen played the long game, focusing on lyrical
    craftsmanship. The rebuttals were sharper, turning ERNIE's size into a weakness
    with 'it's not just size, it's how you use it'. The 'spitting lines from a thread'
    line was a masterclass in double-entendre that ERNIE couldn't match. While ERNIE
    brought the force, Qwen brought the finesse. A critical stumble on the 'unressed'
    rhyme in round two cost ERNIE momentum that it never fully regained. For superior
    consistency, cleverness, and cleaner execution, the win goes to Qwen.
  mistralai/mistral-large: Qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct demonstrated a superior grasp
    of rhythm, flow, and emotional depth in their rhymes. While both contestants showed
    impressive lyrical skills, Qwen's ability to weave a compelling narrative and
    maintain a consistent theme throughout their verses ultimately won the battle.
  openai/gpt-4.1: "Both MCs brought strong wordplay and clever lines, making this\
    \ a tight and dynamic rap battle. Qwen showcased great flow and confidence, emphasizing\
    \ skill over sheer size and making a compelling case for substance in hip hop,\
    \ with lines like \"it\u2019s not just about the numbers\" and \"I\u2019ll take\
    \ your hurricane, turn it into a breeze.\" However, Ernie consistently brought\
    \ sharper punchlines, creative metaphors, and technical prowess, elevating the\
    \ lyrical battle. Verses like \"I'll rip through your rhymes like a shark through\
    \ the night!\" and \"My lyricism strikes with precision and care\" demonstrated\
    \ layered artistry and presence. Overall, Ernie edged out the win by maintaining\
    \ a more aggressive, inventive, and battle-ready performance throughout all rounds."
  x-ai/grok-4: In this rap battle, baidu/ernie-4.5-vl-424b-a47b takes the crown with

    across rounds, particularly in the powerful final verse. qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct
    brought solid counters and energy, but minor rhyme inconsistencies held it back.
