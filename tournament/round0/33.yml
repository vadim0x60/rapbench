    syllable-perfect cadence 2. Thematic coherence with no loss of narrative thread
    3. Strategic use of opponent missteps for comedic/critical punchlines 4. Sustained
    technical vocabulary without resorting to jargon gibberish 5. Strong closing with
    definitive mic-drop moment. Meta-Llama showed flashes of brilliance but ultimately
    sacrificed artistic integrity when technical limitations surfaced mid-performance.

    exchange.'
