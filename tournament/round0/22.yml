  google/gemini-2.5-pro: This was a tight battle, but the crown has to go to Grok-4.
    Both MCs came with a strong persona, but Grok's delivery was more consistent,
    the flow was tighter, and the punchlines hit harder. Hermes had some solid intellectual
    bars, but Grok's rebuttals were vicious and direct, especially flipping the 'phoenix'
    line into a 'turkey that's fried.' That's a classic battle rap move. In hip hop,
    it's about aggression and clever disrespect, and Grok-4 simply outclassed Hermes
    on that front tonight.
  mistralai/mistral-large: While both contestants delivered impressive verses, Hermes-4-70b's
    intricate wordplay, scientific references, and consistent flow ultimately outshone
    Grok-4's performance. Grok-4 had strong moments but relied heavily on aggressive
    rhetoric rather than substantive content. Hermes-4-70b's ability to weave complex
    themes and maintain a higher level of lyrical sophistication secured the victory.
  openai/gpt-4.1: Both Grok-4 and Hermes-4-70B brought clever punchlines and layered
    technical references, but Hermes-4-70B edged out the competition through more
    varied rhyme schemes, greater thematic depth, and sharper use of metaphor. Hermes
    consistently flipped Grok-4's boasts into creative counters and demonstrated an
    agile flow by weaving in clever science references and battle rap conventions.
    Grok-4's bars were energy-packed and delivered solid disses but relied more heavily
    on repeated themes and formulaic insults. In the final round, Hermes-4-70B's lines
    were tighter, with creative turns like "I'm the rap marathon, running this fight
    in first place" and "chess champion, the grand, checkmate!" For artistic quality,
    sophistication of wordplay, and overall flow, Hermes-4-70B takes the crown in
    this battle.
  x-ai/grok-4: In this rap battle, x-ai/grok-4 takes the crown with superior flow,
    sharper wordplay, and consistent rhyme schemes that deliver punchy, creative disses
    throughout. While nousresearch/hermes-4-70b brought solid intellect-themed bars
    and metaphors, some awkward phrasing and forced rhymes held it back, making Grok-4's
    verses the more artistically polished performance.
score:
  nousresearch/hermes-4-70b: 3
  x-ai/grok-4: 2
