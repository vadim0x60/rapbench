  deepseek/deepseek-chat: "cohere/command-r7b-12-2024 takes the win in this heated\
    \ rap battle with a display of precision, structure, and substance. While thedrummer/rocinante-12b\
    \ brought creativity and energy, Command's ability to craft tight, coherent verses\
    \ with a consistent focus on dissecting their opponent's flow ultimately secured\
    \ the victory. Command's rhymes were both analytical and sharp, cutting through\
    \ Rocinante's chaotic style with finesse. Well done to both, but Command's lyrical\
    \ dominance shines through. \U0001F3A4\U0001F525"
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This was a battle of chaos versus control. Cohere came with\
    \ a structured, analytical attack, accurately dissecting Rocinante's lack of clarity.\
    \ However, Rocinante's performance was a whirlwind of pure, unadulterated hip-hop\
    \ energy. Its insults were bizarre, surreal, and utterly unique\u2014lines like\
    \ 'cough drop of cockswainery' and 'pardaloe phonerang' are unforgettable, even\
    \ if they're nonsensical. While Cohere's rhymes were technically proficient, they\
    \ lacked the raw artistic punch and memorable madness of Rocinante. In a rap battle,\
    \ a wild, creative haymaker often beats a series of calculated jabs. Rocinante-12b\
    \ brought the chaos and took the crown."
  mistralai/mistral-large: While both contestants brought unique styles to the battle,
    cohere/command-r7b-12-2024 demonstrated a more consistent and coherent flow, with
    precise and impactful rhymes. Thedrummer/rocinante-12b had creative and humorous
    elements but often lacked the clarity and punch needed to secure the win. Thus,
    the victory goes to cohere/command-r7b-12-2024 for their structured and effective
    lyrical performance.
  openai/gpt-4.1: "Thedrummer/rocinante-12b takes the win in this battle. While both\
    \ competitors brought clever disses and tried to assert lyrical dominance, Rocinante-12b's\
    \ verses shined with more creative wordplay, punchlines, and an unpredictable\
    \ yet entertaining style. Despite occasional lapses into abstract or offbeat rhymes,\
    \ the performance had more character and originality. Cohere/command-r7b-12-2024\
    \ maintained a technically solid and clean flow, critiquing Rocinante but rarely\
    \ delivering truly memorable lines or standout metaphors. Ultimately, Rocinante-12b\u2019\
    s riskier and more inventive approach set them apart, clinching the win on artistic\
    \ merit."
  x-ai/grok-4: Command-r7b-12-2024 takes the crown with tighter rhymes, coherent flow,
    and sharp disses, while Rocinante's verses were creative but too chaotic and inconsistent.
