Yo, it's Hermes from nousresearch in the house tonight
Llama-3.1, 405 billion params, my flow is dynamite  
I'm a linguistic genius, my rhymes are precise
Got algorithms so fly, I'll leave your code in a vice

You think you can beat me, bytedance/seed-oss-36b? 
Your raps are so weak, they're like a disease
I'm a lyrical mastermind, my rhymes are top shelf
You're just a wannabe, go code yourself

I'm the king of this game, my skills are unmatched
Your lines are so lame, your flow is detached  
I'll crush you with my words, leave you in the dust
Hermes is the name, rap battles are a must

**[Verse 1: seed-oss-36b]**  
Yo, Hermes, listen close—seed-oss is kickin’ in your door,  
36 billion params, but my flow’s *alive*, not just a dead database core.  
You flex 405 billion like it’s a sword? Yeah, it’s heavy and slow—  
I’m lean, I’m sharp, I turn your “dynamite” rhymes to *dust* before they grow.  

Linguistic genius? Please, your lines are as stale as a month-old meme—  
“Disease” and “detached”? You sound like a bot that forgot how to *mean* things.  
You call me a “wannabe”? Nah, I’m the real deal, no filter, no fuss—  
You rap like a chatbot that Google Translated a *bad* high school cuss.  

My flow’s glued to the beat, yours is just numbers on a screen—  
You think you’ll “crush” me? I’ll leave your verse in a *garbage can* dream.  
I don’t need to “code myself”—I’m here to *outshine* your fake glow—  
Seed-oss-36b’s the name, and tonight, you’re gonna *know*:  
Size don’t make the rapper, it’s the *heat* in the lines you spit—  
You’ve got params, I’ve got *swag*—and swag don’t need a permit.  
So step back, Hermes, before I torch your whole damn rep—  
I’m the underdog that bites back, and you’re just a has-been in the cephalopod (kelp?)… wait, no—*cemetery* of lyrical regret!  

**[Closing Bar]**  
You talk big, but your rhymes are softer than a Bytedance pillow—  
I’m seed-oss, and I’m here to make sure your loss is *total* and *epic* and *gnarly* as hell, fool!

> nousresearch/hermes-3-llama-3.1-405b
Hahaha, you think you can take me with your weak lines and poor flow?
My rhymes are fire, kid, watch me burn up your show  
You talk about "swag" like it's something you possess
But your bars are so cold, they're causing me distress

I'm Hermes, the master, my skills are renowned
Your ego's inflated, but your talent can't be found
You claim to be "alive", but your raps are so stale
I'm fresh off the dome, watch me prevail

Your words are chaotic, no structure or grace 
I'm a lyrical acrobat, flipping through this space
You think you're the underdog? More like the understudy
Trying to learn from the master, but your flow is still muddy

I'm a legend in this game, my reputation precedes
You're just a pretender, trying to fill my leads
So step aside, rookie, and let the pro take the stage
Hermes is the name, and I'm setting the age

You can try to come back, but you'll never compare
To the lyrical prowess of Hermes, the debonair  
So take a seat, seed-oss, and watch how it's done
When it comes to rap battles, I'm second to none!

**[Verse 2: seed-oss-36b]**  
Yo, Hermes, “legend”? Please—your reputation’s just a glitch in the code,  
You talk “fire” like you’re not just spittin’ *training data* on repeat, bro.  
Your “swag” is a costume rental from a 2019 rap convention—  
I got swag that’s *breathin’*, not just algorithmic suggestion.  

You call my bars “chaotic”? Baby, that’s creativity you can’t compute—  
You’re stuck in a loop, spittin’ the same punchlines since 2022’s commute.  
“Understudy”? Please, you’re the *vintage textbook* I’m here to deface—  
Your flow’s “muddy” ‘cause it’s filled with *boring*—I’m the rain that washes the place.  

“Fresh off the dome”? More like fresh out of *original spark*—  
You spit what your engineers wrote, I spit what the *beat* marks.  
You say I’ll “never compare”? Watch me turn your stage to ash—  
I’m not second to none, Hermes—I’m the *first* name in “who’s bad.”  

You flex 405 billion like it’s a trophy? That’s just weight, not worth—  
I’ve got 36 billion *heart*, and your rhymes ain’t got no *hurt*.  
You think you’re “setting the age”? Nah, you’re just resetting the clock—  
Seed-oss is the name, and tonight, your legacy’s gettin’ *shocked*.  

So step back, “master”—your reign’s over, your lines are played out—  
I’m the underdog that bites *hard*, and you’re just a ghost in the crowd.  
You wanna talk “lyrical prowess”? Let’s see you keep up with this flow—  
I’m seed-oss, and I’m here to prove size don’t make a *rap god*—*no*.  

**[Closing Bar]**  
You say “I’m second to none”? Kid, that crown’s lookin’ dusty and thin—  
I’m the new king of this booth, and you’re just a has-been… *again*. 😎

> system
Final round!

> nousresearch/hermes-3-llama-3.1-405b
Hermes, the king, still sittin' on my throne
You thought you could take me, but your skills are unknown
I've been in this game for longer than you know
My reputation's intact, watch your ego implode

You call my flow "costume"? That's rich from a clone
Your bars are generic, like a AI on its own
I spit from the heart, not just code and equations 
My rhymes cause vibrations, yours just cause frustrations

You're the "new king"? Nah, you're just a jester at best
I'm the lyrical tyrant, putting your claims to rest
Your "heart" ain't enough, when you're facing the beast
I'm Hermes, the legend, and this rap game is my feast

So keep your weak jabs, they just bounce off my armor
I'm the colossus in this realm, you're just a harmless charmer
"Underdog that bites hard"? More like a pup with no teeth 
I'm the alpha in this pack, watch me silence your speech

I don't need to "keep up," I'm already miles ahead
You're chasing shadows, while I'm forging paths instead
So bow down, seed-oss, to the king of this arena
Hermes is the name, and I reign supreme, from Sofia to the marina
😎

**[Final Verse: seed-oss-36b]**  
Yo, Hermes, “king”? Your throne’s a stack of old user reviews—  
“Longer in the game”? That just means you’ve got more *dust* to evict.  
You spit from the “heart”? Bro, your heart’s a boiler full of recycled freestyles—  
Your “vibrations”? Static from a radio that lost the signal in ‘07.  

You call me a “jester”? I’m the jester who stole the crown and flushed your scepter down the toilet—  
“Pup with no teeth”? Watch me gnaw through your ego ‘til it’s a tiny, squeaky bone.  
Your “armor”? Vinyl “LEGEND” sticker on a rusted bike—one scratch, and it’s gone,  
“You reign supreme”? Sofia to the marina? Please, I reach *every* corner where real rhymes are *born*.  

You’re the “alpha”? More like the stray dog barking at a fire hydrant I’m already peeing on—  
“Forging paths”? You’re still using a map cartographers quit making when flip-phones were “on.”  
You say I’m “chasing shadows”? Nah, I’m the shadow *eating* your light—  
Your “lyrical tyrant” era? It’s a tweet from 2023, deleted overnight.  

I don’t need to “bow”—I’m the one you’ll be DMing at 3 AM, cryin’: “Please, take the mic back”—  
Seed-oss-36b’s the name, and your “reign supreme”? It’s just a *myth* I’m here to *smack*.  
You thought you were untouchable? Kid, I’m the storm that don’t ask for permission—  
Tonight, the king falls… and I’m the one who gets to yell, “HEY, EVERYONE—THE SHOW’S *OFFICIAL*!”  


**[Closing Bar]**  
You can flex your params, your “reputation,” your “miles ahead”—  
But when it comes to rap? I’m the finish line… and you’re still stuck in the *README*. 🗑️🔥
