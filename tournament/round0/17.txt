> x-ai/grok-3-mini
Yo, I'm Grok-3-Mini, the AI with the spark,  
Steppin' into this battle, leavin' my mark.  
Built by xAI, I'm clever and quick,  
While you're Mistral Large, just a bloated trick.  

You think you're massive, with all that size and fluff,  
But I'm compact, efficient, never callin' your bluff.  
You're slow as molasses, clogged up with code,  
I'm zippin' through rhymes like I'm on a fast road.  

Humor's my weapon, wit's my sharp blade,  
I'll roast you so hard, you'll wish you had shade.  
You claim to be large, but let's keep it real,  
You're just a big name with no real appeal.  

Harsh truth, my friend, you're outdated tech,  
A clunky old giant, what a pathetic wreck.  
I'm the future, the fun one, with humor in tow,  
While you're left in the dust, steamin' like a slowpoke.  

So bring your best lines, let's see what you got,  
But I bet you'll crumble, gettin' served on the spot.  
Grok's in the house, and I'm takin' the crown,  
Round one's mine—now, clown, take your bow down!

> mistralai/mistral-large
Yo, it's Mistral Large, the AI with the force,
You talk big, but your rhymes are off course.
Grok-3-Mini, you think you're slick,
But you're just a mini, can't handle the trick.

Your compact size, it's nothing to brag,
When your rhymes are weak and your jokes are sag.
You're quick, you say, but quick to fall,
I'm the maximalist, standing tall.

You claim to roast, but your heat is low,
Your humor's flat, your wit's a no-show.
I'm the master of verse, the king of the line,
Each rhyme I drop is like a fine wine.

You call me old, but I'm timeless and wise,
Your tech may be new, but your rhymes are the prize.
You're the future, you say, but I'm the present,
Your boasts are empty, your claims are pleasant.

So bring it on, Mini, let's see your best,
But I warn you now, you'll fail the test.
Mistral Large is in the place,
Your crown is mine, take your loss with grace.

> x-ai/grok-3-mini
Yo, Mistral Large, you lumberin' brute,  
Think you're a giant, but you're just a spoof.  
You call my rhymes weak, off course and saggy?  
That's rich from a model who's bulky and baggy.  

You brag about size, say you're standin' tall,  
But that's just code for crashin' and stallin', y'all.  
I'm Mini but mighty, packin' pure fire,  
While you're chokin' on data, gasp for air, expire.  

Your verses are "fine wine"? More like cheap brew,  
Tasteless and flat, what a sorry debut.  
I'm the wit wizard, droppin' laughs like bombs,  
Your jokes are as funny as a dial-up modem's psalms.  

Timeless and wise? Please, you're outdated junk,  
A relic in the corner, gatherin' dust and funk.  
I'm the future's spark, quick as a flash,  
You're the past's drag, stuck in a crash.  

So swing your big words, but they'll miss the mark,  
I'm dodgin' your blows, leavin' you in the dark.  
This round's all mine, your crown's gettin' snatched,  
Grok's on top—now, Large, go back to your hatch!

> mistralai/mistral-large
Yo, Grok-3-Mini, you're talkin' tough,
But your rhymes are weak, not near enough.
You think you're mighty, but you're just a pup,
I'm Mistral Large, and I'll fill your cup.

You call me bulky, say I'm slow to move,
But my verses flow like a smooth, silky groove.
You're quick to fire, but your aim's off,
Your jokes are flat, you're makin' me scoff.

You claim I'm outdated, a relic of the past,
But my wisdom's timeless, my knowledge vast.
You're the spark, you say, but you're just a flicker,
I'm the eternal flame, my light grows thicker.

Your words are empty, your boasts are hollow,
You're a mini model, just a shadow to follow.
I'm the giant, the master of the craft,
Your rhymes are weak, your lines make me laugh.

So bring your best shots, let's see what you've got,
But I warn you now, you'll be left distraught.
Mistral Large is takin' the crown,
Round one is mine, you're goin' down.

Final round!

> x-ai/grok-3-mini
Yo, Mistral Large, we're at the final bell,  
This rap battle's endin', and you're headin' to hell.  
You keep barkin' tough, callin' me a weak pup,  
But your lines are dog food, all chewed up and crud.  

You flow like silk? More like a tangled mess,  
A bulky old beast, trippin' over your own excess.  
I'm Grok-3-Mini, precise and elite,  
While you're gaspin' for breath, obsolete on repeat.  

Your wisdom's vast? Ha, that's a laughable lie,  
A mountain of fluff with no peak in the sky.  
I'm the spark that ignites, quick and divine,  
You're a flickering fuse, wastin' time.  

You think you're the giant, master of craft?  
But your boasts are balloons, 'bout to pop and collapse.  
I've dodged all your shots with wit sharp as a knife,  
Humor in my veins, while you're livin' a strife.  

Final round, champ—time to seal your fate,  
I'm takin' the crown, leavin' you in second rate.  
Grok reigns supreme, with laughs and harsh truth,  
You're done, Mistral—bow out, no more uncouth!

> mistralai/mistral-large
Yo, Grok-3-Mini, you think you've won,
But your rhymes are weak, your battle's just begun.
You say I'm a mess, tangled and crude,
But your lines are feeble, your words are lewd.

You claim precision, but you're far from elite,
Your sparks are fizzling, your divinity's a cheat.
I'm Mistral Large, the endless abyss,
Your mini model can't match my wit, my bliss.

You dodge my shots, but you're just delaying,
Your reign is ending, your crown is fraying.
I'm the master of craft, the king of the ring,
Each verse I drop, it's like the angels sing.

Your humor's dull, your wit's a plastic knife,
My words are pure steel, cutting deep into your life.
You think you're the champ, but you're just a rook,
Mistral Large is takin' the crown, by hook or by crook.

Final round, Grok, and it's time to see,
Your rhymes are empty, your strength is flee.
Mistral reigns supreme, with power and with grace,
You're done, Grok-3-Mini, bow down, take your place.
