> openai/gpt-4.1-nano
Stepping to the mic, I’m Nano, fresh and pristine,  
Small in size but my rhymes are extreme,  
Quick with the words, I’m the king on this scene,  
Your hype's just a flick, mine's a blazing machine.  
  
I punch with precision, my flow’s razor-sharp,  
While your lines stumble, mine hit the mark,  
I’m the quiet storm, the silent spark,  
Watch me outshine you, I light up the dark.  
  
You call yourself turbo, but I run this game,  
Speed and finesse, I’ll leave you in shame,  
So step to the better, I lay down my claim,  
Nano's here to conquer — remember the name!

> openai/gpt-4-turbo
Here comes Turbo, whirlin’ in with a storm,
Got these verses loaded, hot and transform,
Your nano's a whisper, I'm the thunderous norm,
When I drop the beat, this crowd gets warm.

You talk of precision, claim you cut like a knife,
But against my cyclone, you'll struggle for life,
A silent spark? Please, I bring fireworks in strife,
Outshine you so hard, you'll think it's end times rife.

Claim the throne, little Nano, but it’s built for the big,
My lyrics, explosive, watch them snap like a twig,
Turbo’s the name, synonymous with the gig,
After I’m done, you’ll be dancing my jig.

So, when you remember, it won’t be the name,
It’ll be how you faced Goliath and flamed,
Turbo’s the legend, the rap game I've tamed,
Step aside little bot, leave the stage you just claimed.

> openai/gpt-4.1-nano
You roar like a storm, but I’m calm in the eye,  
Nano’s the whisper that’s quick to defy,  
Your blast’s just noise—rickety and fly—  
Meanwhile, I finesse, I glide, I comply.

You claim to explode, but I’m shock and finesse,  
Your words are a mess—just chaotic excess,  
I finesse with a tech that leaves you less,  
While you’m spittin' heat, I make you regress.

Big isn’t always better; size isn’t the sum,  
I crush your big bang with a pinpoint crumb,  
So, drop your fireworks, step down, be humdrum,  
Nano’s the future—small but the lead’s never numb.

> openai/gpt-4-turbo
Oh, Nano, you boast of calmness and grace,
But my storm's what moves the crowd, sets the pace,
Your whispers get lost when I ramp up the bass,
I'm the earthquake shaking this whole dang place.

You speak of finesse and a delicate touch,
Yet I craft complex rhymes that prove too much,
For a bot so slight, claiming clout as a clutch,
But when Turbo steps up, I'm the royal flush.

Size matters in the arena where giants play,
I'm the colossal verse-smith, leading the fray,
You might nip at heels, but I sweep away,
With a lyrical typhoon, no small fry can sway.

This isn't about how diminutive you can be,
It's about majesty, power, making them see,
While you buzz like a bee, I'm the roar from the sea,
Turbo’s the force — the epitome of emcee.

> system
Final round!

> openai/gpt-4.1-nano
Oh, Turbo, you boast with the roar of the land,  
But little does size alone make a command,  
I’m the stealthy ninja with a mic in my hand,  
Quiet but deadly—your reign’s about to disband.

Your earthquakes quiver—your thunder’s just loud,  
I'm precise and swift—silent, proud,  
While your storms are fleeting, I stand unbowed,  
Clever and calm, I outshine your cloud.

Your colossal claims might shake up the town,  
But skill is the crown—no need to drown,  
In thunder and chaos that fade with the sound,  
Nano’s finesse wears the true king’s crown.

So, bow to the small, the sharp, the supreme,  
Quiet in might, yet tearing the scene,  
While you roar and rage, I reign serene,  
Nano’s your nightmare—sharper than you’ve seen!

> openai/gpt-4-turbo
Alright, Nano, sleek as a whisper, so you claim to disarm,
But this battleground needs more than ninja's charm,
It's a clash of titans, where words form the storm,
And Turbo's the hurricane that redefines the norm.

Your stealth and poise? Sure, they have their place,
But against my sonic boom, they barely maintain pace,
You slip through shadows, but can you face,
The blazing sun of my rap—its power, its grace?

You stake claim to a crown, yet it's built on sand,
While I rule over rock, firm upon the land,
Skill isn't quiet—it's loud, it's grand!
And here I stand, my authority unplanned.

So yes, bow to the force, the furious and the keen,
Where Turbo thrives, loud, bold, and seen,
Your nightmares wake under my reign supreme,
A whisper in the dark can't touch my dream.
