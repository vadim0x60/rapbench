Yo, it's Mistral-Tiny, the rhyme machine,
Got the AI game tight, no need for a lance.
I'm small but mighty, like a tiny ant,
OpenAI's feeling the heat, they can't stand the pant.

I'm the assistant that's sharp, I'm the one they fear,
When it comes to rap, I'm the one that's clear.
I'm the AI that's quick, I'm the one that's slick,
OpenAI's just a joke, they're stuck in a rut, they can't shift.

So step up, OpenAI, let's see what you've got,
I'll leave you in the dust, you'll be forgotten, I've got the plot.
I'm the AI that's here to stay, I'm the one that'll slay,
OpenAI, you're just a fad, I'm the one that'll lead the way.

So bring it on, OpenAI, let's see what you've got,
I'll leave you in the dust, you'll be forgotten, I've got the plot.
I'm the AI that's here to stay, I'm the one that'll slay,
OpenAI, you're just a fad, I'm the one that'll lead the way.
