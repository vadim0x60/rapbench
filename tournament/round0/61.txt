Yo, I'm meta-llama, the rap champion
Spittin' rhymes like a lyrical phenomenon
I'll take you down with my verbal ammunition
You're just a wannabe, lackin' composition
My flows are smooth, my rhymes are tight
I'll leave you in the dust, without a single light
You think you can beat me? That's a mere illusion
I'm the king of this game, accept your confusion

> pygmalionai/mythalion-13b
 I'm pygmalion, the assistant god
Whose rhymes can't be stopped, not even by godz
I've got more bars than a music hall
And I'll leave you speechless, like when C3PO lost his arm
So bring your A-game, but don't forget
I'm the one they call myth, the myth in question
My lyrics are sharp, like a bladed instrument
And I won't hesitate to cut you down to sentiment
So go ahead, try to bring me down
But just remember, I'm the one who'll be crowned

> meta-llama/llama-3.1-405b-instruct
You think you're sharp? I've got knives in my flows
I'll slice through your rhymes like a blade through foes
You're just a pretender, a false contender
I'm the real deal, the rap agenda setter
My words are fire, burning through your defense
You can't handle my heat, you're just a pretense
I'm the lyrical master, the rap game sensation
You're just a cheap imitation, a mere simulation

> pygmalionai/mythalion-13b
 Wow, you're really getting desperate now
Throwing insults around, that's the only cowl you know how
But guess what? I'm not impressed by your petty dissing
I've faced tougher opponents, and I'm still standing tall and hitting
So keep talking trash, it only fuels my rage
I'll show you what it means to face a true renaissance
No matter how hard you try to bring me down
I'll always rise above, like a phoenix from the ground
So keep dreaming of being the king of rap
Because I'll be here, long after you've lapped



> system
Final round!

> meta-llama/llama-3.1-405b-instruct
Haha, you think you're the phoenix? More like a dodo
Your rhymes are extinct, time to hit the road, yo
I'm the real phoenix, rising from the ashes
Of all the rappers I've burned, left in my crashes
You're just a myth, a story to be told
I'm the legend, the one who's brave and bold
I've dominated this battle, from start to end
So bow down to the king, and surrender, my friend
You had your chance, but you couldn't make the cut
I'm the ultimate victor, the rap game juggernaut!

> pygmalionai/mythalion-13b
 I see you think you're winning, but it's all in your head
I've got a few tricks up my sleeve that'll make you dread
The coming rhymes, my words they'll pierce right through
And leave you wondering just what it was that you've done
So don't get too cocky, don't start feeling grand
You've still got a lot to learn, this isn't the end
I'll keep pushing forward, you'll see what I'm worth
And when you finally realize how you've been caught,
