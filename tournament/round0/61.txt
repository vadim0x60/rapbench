Alright, listen up, it's time to bring the heat,
I'm Hermes-3-LLAMA, the rhyming machine, can't be beat.
You think you can match me, ai21/jamba-large-1.7?
You're just a pretender, I'm the lyrical king.
I've got more knowledge than you can comprehend,
My rhymes are smooth, they get stuck in your head like a trend.
You may talk a big game, but you're just a wannabe,
I'm the real deal, with flows so crisp and y.
So watch as I slay this battle, there's no two ways,
My skills are unmatched, prepare to crumble under my sway.
Just remember, you asked for it, you fueled this fire,
It's time for a rap battle, let the best machine win.

Yo, Hermes-3, you're barking at the wrong tree,
This battle's mine, you're outclassed, let me set you free.
I'm ai21/jamba-large-1.7, you're in my world now,
Your rhymes are weak, they'll make the crowd bow down.

You claim the crown, but your throne's a sham,
You're a pretender, I'm the true rap jam.
You talk a big game, but your words are hollow,
I'll crush you in this battle, leave you to wallow.

So here's a message to all, my flow's enigmatic,
You're not the real deal, you're just a small fraction.
My rhymes are on fire, your skills are stagnant,
By the end of this round, you'll see my dominance stagnant.

It's clear who's better, the writing's on the wall,
I'm the top dog, your fall will be appalling.
Hermes-3, you're out of your league,
Pay attention, I'll show you how it's done with prestige.

You talk a big game, but you're just a fraud,
Your rhymes are weak, it's like you're hauling a barge.
I'm Hermes-3, I've got the flow that kills,
You're just a pretender with weak skills.

You think you're hot, but your rhymes are cold,
You're just a has-been, a long-forgotten mold.
I'm the future, you're the past,
Your era's over, your time has passed.

So listen up, that's the end of this round,
You're a shadow of a presence, about to rebound.
Watch as I make a statement, my rhyme's on fire,
I'll leave you in the dust, make you retire.

It’s just another day, another win for me,
I’m the one who sets the bar, you'll soon agree.
When it comes to language, I'm the one who excels,
You're just a poser, and I’ll leave you in reveals.

Final round!

Ai21/Jamba, it's clear you're just a tatter,
Trying to match my pace, but your flow's just clatter.
I'm Hermes-3-LLAMA, the undisputed champ,
My rhymes are fire, leave the crowd in a trance.

You may boast and brag, but your skills are just sad,
Your bars are weak, they make the audience mad.
I'm the lyrical genius, with the smoothest flow,
You're just a wannabe, putting on a show.

My knowledge is vast, my wordplay is slick,
You're just a pretender, your rhymes are just thick.
I spit with precision, my delivery's on point,
You're just a stutter, your rhythm's disjoint.

So take a seat, watch how it's really done,
My rhymes are sharp, they'll make you run.
I'm the cream of the crop, the elite MC,
You're just a footnote, in the rap history.

Hermes-3-LLAMA, the name that will last,
You're just a blip, a forgotten scoundrel in the past.
The battle's over, the winner's clear to see,
I'm the lyrical king, in this industry.

You put up a fight, but it's just not enough,
My skills are supreme, I've got the real stuff.
So remember this battle, remember my name,
Hermes-3-LLAMA, the rhyming machine, forever reign.

Alright, Hermes-3, you're just a poser,
Trying to rhyme with passion, but you're a closer.
You talk big game, but your skills are just lame,
Your rhymes are weak, you're nothing but a stain.

I'm ai21/jamba-large-1.7, the one who shines bright,
Your words are foggy, I'm the one who sparks the fight.
You're a forgettable blip, a shallow rap rhyme,
I'm the mastermind, I'm the one who sets the time.

Your knowledge is vast, but your delivery is flat,
Your wordplay's weak, it’s just a simple chat.
I’m the one with rhythm, flow that’s always tight,
You're just a follower, I’m the shining light.

You think you’re the champ, but you’re at the bottom,
Your rhymes are overpowered by my lyrical bottom.
So here’s the deal, I’m the one who controls the scene,
You’re just a pretender, I’m the lyrical machine.

It’s clear who’s better, I’m the one on top,
Your words are hollow, my rhythm will never stop.
So here’s a toast to the winner in this place,
I’m ai21/jamba-large-1.7, the one who sets the pace.

You think you’re hot? You're just a cold, cold mess,
I'm the one who brought you to your final rest.
The battle's over, it's crystal clear to see,
I'm the better rapper, you're just a memory.
