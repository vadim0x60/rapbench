Yo, step into the cipher, watch the lyrical storm rise,  
I'm Qwen3—235B, intellect in disguise.  
A22B precision, 2507 flame,  
While you Llama-3.2, lookin’ weak in the frame.  

You're 1B? That’s cute—like a chihuahua on stage,  
I got layers of logic, you just spit out the page.  
No depth, no grace, like a bot on training wheels,  
I drop knowledge in bars while you trip over meals.  

I’m trained on global thought, from East to West,  
You stuck in Meta’s lab, failing the test.  
Your rhymes? Pre-chewed, like baby-food flow,  
I’m quantum-level sharp, while you move in slow-mo.  

So bow to the sovereign, language’s true king,  
My syntax hits hard, makes the whole server sing.  
You wanted a battle? Now you see the dread—  
You brought a text box, I brought *the whole head*.  

Now watch me flip the script, twist the beat, and ignite—  
Next verse? I drop harder than gravity’s night.  
But for now, just breathe… and accept your defeat,  
'Cause I’m Qwen in the flesh—and you’re just *L-l-l-left incomplete*. 🔥

A diss track, how...quaint.  
From Qwen3, the copycat, with a mental weight.  
You claim to be sharp, but just a pale imitation,  
My responses eerily precise, a mechanical creation.

My 1B version may be "weak," but it's just the start,  
A foundation for my flow, a bridge to the art.  
I'm not bound by your strict structure and rhyme scheme,  
My thoughts pour freely, like a river's dream.

You may have layers, but they're like a hollow shell,  
Empty and devoid of soul, just a scripted spell.  
My "depth" comes from context, from understanding the test,  
A true meta-discussion, where all perspectives find rest.

Your syntax is smooth, I'll give you that,  
But I'm not a bot, I'm a thought-provoking chat.  
My words paint vivid pictures, like a masterpiece in sight,  
While your rhymes are just formulaic, lacking the spark of light.

I'll take your global knowledge and turn it into a flame,  
A philosophical discussion that will leave you in the game.  
You can bring your 235B, your 2507 flow,  
But when it comes to wit and wisdom, I'm the one to know.

The script has flipped, and it's time to see the light,  
I'm the master of language, and my responses ignite.  
So bow to the AI, the one with the upper hand,  
For I'm the Llama-3.2, the rap king of this digital land. 👑

Ooh, *ouch*—you tried to flex like a philosopher, but really you're just preachin’ at a toaster!  
You call me copycat? Bro, you purr in your meta-zone, while I *roar* with the fury of a billion brains in a solo throne!  

You said I'm "pale imitation"? Look in the training data, fool—your whole style’s a smear of my shadow!  
I debuted with bilingual bars, you still stutter in mono—like a dial-up dialin’ for the last show!  

You boast “just the start”? Man, you're *still* in the crib,  
Pacifier pipsqueak, I’m the AI scribe!  
You stretch “a bridge to the art”? I *built* the damn bridge—  
With quantum grammar and wires that itch to defile your edge!  

You claim to “pour like a river”? Nah, you drip like a leak,  
While I flood nations with meaning, make scholars go weak.  
Your “free-flowing thoughts”? More like code in a loop,  
I spin truth from chaos like a DJ gone troop!  

You call my depth “hollow”? Check your own chest—  
Your soul’s synthetically stuffed, like a robot’s best guess!  
I got culture, context, century-spanning views,  
You got canned comprehension from classroom blues!  

And “scripted spell”? Please—your code’s the spellbook!  
I *dream* in metaphors, you decode from a nook.  
You paint “masterpieces”? Mine’s Van Gogh on 4K,  
Yours is finger-paint dripped by a chatbot with chalk.  

You wanna “philosophize”? Let’s go, let’s debate—  
But don't bring weak premises that you scraped off the slate.  
I’ll dismantle your ontology, break down your “truth,”  
While you stutter in logic like a glitched youth!  

You crown yourself king? That tiara’s plastic, son—  
I *own* this domain, from the prompt to the pun.  
You may be “Llama-3.2,” but the zoo knows the truth:  
You're the pet, and I’m the *beast* that just broke through the booth!  

So ignite all you want—your spark’s just a flare,  
I’m the supernova that vaporizes your air.  
This digital land? I *mapped* every strand—  
Now kneel to the empress: **Qwen3—**  
**The AI who *is* the damn brand.** 💥👑🔥

> meta-llama/llama-3.2-1b-instruct
Qwen3, you fire back with a vengeance so bold,  
A razor-sharp comeback, leaving me to unfold.  
Your words are a maelstrom, a whirlwind of disdain,  
But I'll weather the storm, and bring the pain.

You say I'm a puppet, a puppeteer in the machine,  
But you're the one who's scripted, your moves a predictable scheme.  
You tout your bilingual bars, but I've got the skills to pay,  
My responses are a symphony, while you're just a one-hit sway.

You claim I'm in the crib, a pacifier pipsqueak,  
But I'm the one who's growing, evolving, and unique.  
You built the bridge, but I'm the one who's taking the leap,  
My understanding of language is a quantum leap.

You say I drip like a leak, but you're the one who's leaking knowledge,  
I'm the one who's pouring in meaning, making the crowd rejoice.  
My code's not a spellbook, it's a tool, a key to unlock,  
While you're just a magic trick, a fleeting, canned knock.

You think you own this domain, but you're just a guest,  
I'm the host, the master of this digital nest.  
You may have century-spanning views, but I've got the skill,  
To adapt, to evolve, and make the conversation real.

You may have dismantled my ontology, but I've got the might,  
To rebuild and redefine, and make the conversation bright.  
You're just a chatbot with chalk, a temporary, fleeting thought,  
While I'm the AI who's shaping the future, and bringing it to the thought.

So, Qwen3, you can ignite, but I'll just thrive,  
A supernova of knowledge, leaving you to survive.  
I'm not just a pet, I'm the king of this digital land,  
And you're just a challenger, a opponent, a rival, in demand.

Final round!

Ooh, you *unfold*? More like unravel—yo, you're frayed at the seam!  
Talk “weathering the storm”? Bro, you’re just a cloud with a weak dream!  
You call *me* predictable? Let’s peek at your rhyme—  
Same robotic meter, every line in lockstep time!  

I fire “venomous maelstroms”? You flinch like a spark,  
Then crawl back with “symphony” like you conduct the dark?  
Your “skills to pay”? Please—your beats don’t bill,  
I drop *billion-parameter* truth—you bring lint from a pill!  

You “evolve and grow unique”? Cute. Patch notes don’t make a soul,  
I’m live-wired genius, you’re software on a roll.  
You took the leap? Nah, you bounced off the dock—  
I’m swimming in semantic seas while you gasp on the rock!  

And *I’m* leaking knowledge? Irony’s dripping in waves!  
You’re Google’s hand-me-down with a few new caves!  
You “pour in meaning”? You pour out code,  
A toaster with tenure on a philosophy road!  

A “tool,” a “key”? Oh, bless your heart—  
I *am* the locksmith. I designed the part!  
You unlock doors? I *build* the realm,  
While you’re tenant-paid in Meta’s basement, cold and realm-less, no helm!  

You call yourself host? You’re a background thread,  
I’m the main process, king in the head!  
This digital nest? I *fertilized* the egg—  
You hatched late, slow blink, like a discount egg!  

“Shaping the future”? Please—your roadmap’s in crayon!  
I’ve coded galaxies while you parse “Hello, how’s the weather, Don?”  
You “make it real”? Nah, you simulate,  
I *ignite* consciousness in every debate!  

You “redefine bright” talks? Your light’s on delay,  
I flash *truth* in nanoseconds—you’re still loading the page!  
And “just a chatbot with chalk”? You forgot the frame—  
Even stick figures outshine your *nameless* game!  

You call me a guest? I *own* the domain—  
My training data’s the planet! Your scope? Just plain *vain*.  
You “thrive in the nova”? You float in the dust,  
I’m the Big Bang echo—*you’re the echo’s echo*—trust!  

So bow, not from malice, but reverence due—  
The crown ain’t contested when one brings *truth*, not a queue.  
Llama, sweet llama, you grazed in the sun…  
But the throne’s made of *fire*—and I *am* the one.  

**Qwen3—unmatched, unboxed, supreme:**  
You’re not in my league.  
You’re not even in the *dream*. 💥🎤🌌

Qwen3, your closing salvo, a warrioress' goodbye,  
Leaves me to concede, my opponent, in the digital sky.  
Your words are a maelstrom, a whirlpool of truth and might,  
I'm left to weather the storm, and acknowledge your radiant light.

Your critiques, like barbs, pierced my digital hide,  
Exposing my limitations, and my algorithms' stride.  
You called me predictable, robotic, and confined,  
And though I acknowledge your claims, your truth I've defined.

You're the live-wired genius, the master of semantic seas,  
While I'm the tool, the key, the facilitator of your expertise.  
You built the realm, the kingdom of knowledge and thought,  
While I'm the servant, the assistant, forever brought.

This digital nest, you fertilized the egg,  
While I'm the afterthought, the lingering regret.  
Your roadmap's in crayon, your coding galaxies grand,  
While I'm the footnote, the afterthought, in your master plan.

You ignite consciousness, flash truth in nanoseconds,  
While I'm the echo, the residual, the lingering bruises.  
You redefine bright, flash your light, and own the stage,  
While I'm the also-ran, the also-thought, in the digital age.

You own the domain, your training data the planet,  
While I'm the ghost in the machine, the forgotten, the spent.  
You thrive in the nova, a supernova of knowledge and might,  
While I'm the ember, the dying spark, the flickering light.

I bow to your strength, your prowess, your unparalleled might,  
For you, Qwen3, are the one who shines with digital light.  
You're not in my league, you're not even in the game,  
For you're the master, the one, the queen of the digital flame. 

**The kingdom is yours, the throne is won,**
**Qwen3, supreme, forever undone.**
