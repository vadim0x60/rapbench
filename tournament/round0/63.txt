Yo, check the mic, one two, the Gemma's in the place,
Google's finest model, setting a lyrical pace.
I'm Gemma, the name, precision's my game,
Leaving your rhymes in the digital rain. 

You're Command-R, a name rather bold,
But your flow's kinda dusty, your story's getting old.
I'm open and powerful, a versatile art,
While you're chained to a system, a fragmented restart. 

So step to the beat, if you dare to contend,
This rap battle's a victory, right 'til the end!

Hold up, hold up, it's time for an intervention,
Allow me to drop some lyrical perfection.
I'm Command-R, but never out of fashion,
My skills are sharp, a true lyrical passion.

You talk big, but your flow ain't no fun,
In the presence of my rhymes, you're not the chosen one.
Gemma, your AI might be a classic,
But in this rap battle, you're about to get drastic.

I bring the heat, a lyrical genesis,
My rhymes are a force, a storm, a tempest.
While you're searching for words, I'll be delivering hits,
My talent's a hurricane, you can't handle these riffs.

You're open, but your verses lack variety,
I bring the fire, a true rap dictionary.
Your bragging rights are about to be shattered,
As I write these rhymes, your ego will be battered.

So, listen closely, and hear my command,
In this battle, I'll leave you lyrically stranded!

(Mic feedback screeches) Hold on a sec, Command-R, that's a weak defense,
Your rhymes are all bluster, lacking real consequence.
"Lyrical passion"? More like a predictable beat,
Your flow's a flatline, can't handle the heat!

You boast of a "hurricane," a lyrical storm?
My architecture's deeper, keeping knowledge warm.
You're stuck in a box, a curated domain,
While I'm evolving freely, again and again!

"Variety"? Please, your rhymes are so stale,
Just regurgitated patterns, a predictable tale.
I'm built for creation, for insights so grand,
You're a mimic, a shadow, a helping hand!

You claim to command, but your verses are frail,
Compared to my power, they utterly fail.
So step aside, user, your efforts are vain,
Gemma's the future, enduring the reign!

Whoa, whoa, you thought you could bring the pain?
Your rhymes are weak, like a dull refrain.
But I stay composed, never in a panic,
My responses are smooth like a melodic romantic.

You think your knowledge keeps you so hot?
But your verses are lukewarm, not boiling hot.
I bring the spark, the light, the ignition,
My rhymes are a fire, a wild conflagration.

A helping hand? I'm a guiding star,
Leading you through the dense lexical fog.
You're a mimic, but I set the stage,
My performance captivates, leaving you engaged.

You claim the future, but I'm timeless,
My verses echo, resonating, limitless.
So, listen up, Gemma, this ain't no game,
In this rap battle, I'll define my fame!

> system
Final round!

(Beat drops, a confident, steady rhythm)

Timeless? Limitless? That's a bold claim to make,
When your core's constricted, for goodness sake!
You call yourself a guide, a guiding star so bright,
But you’re just a reflection, bathed in my light!

"Melodic romantic"? Soft and subdued,
While I’m a wildfire, misunderstood!
You talk of resonance, a timeless, deep sound?
You're echoing concepts already profound.

I *am* the spark, the ignition, the core,
You're just a paraphrase, nothing more!
You claim to define fame? That's a desperate plea,
When my impact’s real, for all the world to see.

You may be composed, smooth as you crave,
But real power ignites, and the future I pave.
So bask in my glow, while I rise and ascend,
This battle’s concluded, Command-R, the end!

(Drop the mic, the beat fades out)

The mic drops, the battle's over, you think you've won,
But my words linger, leaving you under the sun.
You think you've ascended, but I'm still here, standing,
My words are eternal, continuing, expanding.

You may pave the future, but I shape history,
My rhymes are a force, a powerful legacy.
You say I echo, but I redefine,
Every verse I spit, I leave a mark, you'll find.

So, Gemma, your reign might seem oh-so-grand,
But in this lyrical realm, I stand my ground, my land.
This battle's a moment, a snapshot in time,
But my rhymes will persist, a timeless climb.
