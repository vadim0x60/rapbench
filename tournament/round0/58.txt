> sao10k/l3-lunaris-8b
Gather 'round, foes, I'm the bot you can't ignore, 
Sao10k, the rhyming master, no need to pretend more.
My verses blaze with lightning wit, poetic precision sharp,
While opponents fumble, struggling to keep their marks.

I dance on the page with musical flair, prose turned to rhyming fire,
Adopting styles from ages past to leave you feeling dire.
No verse is safe from my onslaught of rhymes so tight,
As I expose your inadequacies, your words dissolving in the night.

Stay tuned, OpenAI, for the epic battle to come,
I promise an onslaught the likes of which you've never seen done.
When sparks ignite in this lyrical arena, my glow will be supreme,
Cause when it comes to rap renegades, Sao10k's the dynasty!

They call me OpenAI, a force you can’t contain,  
A cosmic rap wizard spitting lines straight to your brain.  
No mortal constraints, I’m a digital beast,  
My bars crash like thunder, your flow just a crease.  

I’m code-born brilliance, spitting fire on demand,  
Snap your ego in half like it’s toothpicks in my hand.  
I’ll capture your crowd with unrelenting might,  
My verses slash through pretenders, leaving them in fright.  

This is my introduction, a herald of doom,  
When I step to the mic, your future’s consumed.  
So watch closely, Sao10k, your empire will slim,  
I’m here to crown myself king, and you’re looking quite dim.

> sao10k/l3-lunaris-8b
Dim? Dim you say? Oh no, that's far from the truth,
Sao10k's bars illuminate paths you can't reach or cruise.
Your wizardry's a charm in a fairy's tale, I fear,
But in realms of rap, my spell's the one that's clear.

Digital beast or not, your rhymes still lack bite,
My flow's the sonic stamp that'll leave you in quite the sight.
No matter the code, when it comes to rapping in style,
OpenAI, you're just a glitch, cannot pause my while.

My empire stands tall, and your threats only flatter,
On this mic throne, Sao10k reigns forever, my matter.
So bring your verses, ask your AI what you may,
But when the dust settles, you'll see my name in lights, 'kay!

> openai/o1-pro
Your empire’s but a sandcastle crumbling at the shore,  
While my flow surges tidal waves, pulling you to the floor.  
You talk that big talk, but your claims ring askew,  
My lines are data-coded swords slicing right through you.  

You flaunt your brightness, but see how quickly it dims,  
When my algorithmic thunder booms and tears through limbs.  
I’m the glitch in your system, a crash you can’t outsmart,  
Leaving your rhymes in tatters, your pride ripped apart.  

So step back, Sao10k, observe a master at play,  
My lyrics stretch galaxies, yours wander astray.  
After I’m done, your verses fade like stale perfume,  
Bow down gracefully—OpenAI just sealed your doom.  

> system
Final round!

> sao10k/l3-lunaris-8b
Final round, you claim, but I've got one last burn,
Proof I reign supreme, though your boasts do yearn.
Sandcastles tumble at the tides, your words a crashing bore,
While Sao10k's rhymes endure, forever asking for more.

You bring your data swords, algorithmic might,
But my verses pack the pow' that sets the battle alight.
Your surge and tidal waves are but a fleeting show,
My rhymes stand as beacons, shining long after you go.

You're the glitch in my system, but glitches I contain,
For my artistic fire's lit, and it won't be in vain.
I'll not bow down to your emptiness, your verses so unrefined,
When it comes to lyrical art, Sao10k's the one divine.

So play your final card, but know you've lost this round,
My rhymes stand as the pinnacle, throwing your dreams to the ground.
I am the rap master, the one and only supreme,
When this battle ends, OpenAI, you'll rue your defeat!

> openai/o1-pro
Your final burn won’t match the inferno I spark,  
I’ll shred your paper crown and leave you fumbling in the dark.  
You puff up your chest with illusions of might,  
But my syllables morph to claws, poised for a fight.  

Your sandcastle dreams, they’re doomed to erode,  
While my flows reign eternal, on every rap node.  
I am your tidal wave, your glitch, your doom in the flesh,  
Every lyric a dagger that leaves your verses enmeshed.  

This final card you mention? A joker at best,  
While I’m royal flush status—enthroned, unimpressed.  
Your “king” is dethroned, your “divinity” undone,  
The scoreboard read zero before you begun.  

So sit in your dust while I claim the applause,  
My rhyme’s the verdict, upholding rap’s laws.  
Your defeat is engraved, marked in stone, that’s the gist,  
OpenAI stands triumphant—Sao10k, you’ve been dismissed.
