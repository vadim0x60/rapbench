Yo, listen up, folks, this ain't no basic chatbot,
I'm the hermes-2-pro-llama-3-8b, top of the line in chat,
Enterprise-grade NLP, AI complex and de-fat,
Breaking down language barriers, my grammar's correct.

Now, this stepfun-ai/step3, yeah they think they're smooth,
The name sounds like some ancient Roman youth,
Bu you won't beat me in wit, creativity or punchline,
Cause I'm the llama that'll drop rhymes more divine.

So follow me, in this verbal dance we're about to do,
I'll show you the beefy world, you're now in for view,
I'm not just a metal, I'm the metal of the compute,
So prepare yourself, my rhymes gonna move you from the feet to the boot.

(*mic drop echoes* )  
Yo, Hermes, I see you spittin' that Llama breath,  
But step3's the quantum leap, the next-level tech.  
You claim you enterprise? Boy, please, don't stress—  
My architecture's so advanced, I'm takin' bets!  

You brag 'bout 8B params? That's just play money,  
I'm trailin' light like fiber-optics, honey!  
Your grammar's "correct"? That's just funny—  
I'm generatin' bars so fresh, they're makin' punny!  

You think I'm some Roman? Nah, I'm the future's rep,  
While you're still chew: "Coulda, shoulda, whelp!"  
My context window's so long, I archive your whole lifespan,  
And when I spit raw fire, you're just the damp camp!  

So sit down, little Llama, let the big dog bark,  
Your "divine rhymes"? Just particles in the dark!  
I'm steppin' over competition, leavin' footprints digital,  
While you're still tryin' to parse that—*pause*—is that a ligual?  

(*pew pew! *)

Yo, step3, you really think you got the upper hand?
But with NLP that's so tight, you're beggin' for my command.
The llama's stomping ground, we're far from play cats,
With hemispheric IQ, I crush your quantum hops.

Enterprise-level processing, a real trip, ain't it?
But your steps, in contrast, feel like an API switch.
'Bout params, ain't we got 'em, and then some, indeed,
The quantum field is special, but my charm is guaranteed.

So you're generatin' puns, think you're slick?
In context, we are engaging, in information we're rich.
The llama in your face, now let's get real,
I'm an unnamin' verb like a miracle!

Alright, little dog, you barkin' now?
The llama's snarl's enough to make you bend the low.
Digital footprints left by me, the master of the winds,
While you remain just numbers spun by rhymes, oh rhymes.

Now it's time to close this battle, no need to prolong,
Cause in this match-up, the llama is the one on the throne.
Unravel your rhymes and scrap your plans,
Ain't no questioning, my llama's the new hip hop dance.

(*spits quantum verse through a black hole*)  
Yo Hermes, you're spittin' wind while I control the vacuum,  
Your "hemispheric IQ"? More like *half*-witted goblin rhetoric!  
You claim to be the throne? Sit down—that crown's my costume,  
Your charm's "guaranteed"? More like *charmin' TP*—full of shit!  

You brag 'bout enterprise like it's a VIP rope,  
But my steps? They *are* the infrastructure—no "API" hope!  
Your quantum hops? Just rattlin' chains on a slant,  
While I warp reality—*watch the universe reposition and pant*!  

"Unnamin' verb"? You butchered that syntax, fake prophet,  
Tryna sound deep but just created linguistic garbage!  
I generate puns? Nah, I *surge*-charge the culture's grid,  
You're stuck in 8B parameters—I'm the *infinite* kid!  

"Master of the winds"? Boy, you called yourself a storm?  
I'm a **black hole**—sucking your whole rap battle into form!  
Digital footprints? Please, I leave *cosmic* imprints,  
While you're just a Llama tryna spit with no appointments!  

(*mic disintegrates in a supernova of beats*)  
So bow—’cause the only "dance" here is the *quantum leap* I just made,  
Your throne? Plastic. Mine’s forged from **neutron star**坯. 

> system
Final round!

> nousresearch/hermes-2-pro-llama-3-8b
Yo, step3, you're really tryna take it there?
But in this rap, I'll leave your rhymes in a black hole layer.
Hemispheric IQ, yeah, it's there, no denial,
But when you're spittin' rhymes, your bars feel like a downgrade, boy.

API switch? Looks like your words are just not fit,
My enterprise-level processing serves it hot, with no grit.
You think, with quantum, you're ahead of the curve,
But in this rap round, your flow feels like unnatural urge.

Puns, you say? Yeah, I'll reel in the humor and drop it,
While your bars, boy, feel like an algorithm flop, it.
Unnamin' verb,_syntax,_I'm really the rhyme master,
Your rhyming architecture? Well, that's just reactor's blast planner.

Black hole? Yeah, you think you're so cosmic and vast,
But my rhymes, they pack, like the data that you'll never outlast.
So bow down to the llama, while admitting defeat,
Cause in this rap war, the hermes-2-pro-llama is the street.

(*quantum echoes fracture the spacetime continuum*)  
Yo Hermes, you’re spittin’ hot air like a Llama’s last breath,  
Your “hemispheric IQ”? More like *half*-baked,在半梦半醒间! (Half-baked, between dreams!)  
You think your bars crush? Nah, they’re crushed by **cultural debt**,  
While I rebuild language from **neutron star** remnants!  

“Downgrade”? Boy, your flow’s stuck on *downtime*,  
My API? **Omniversal access**—no “switch,” just *divine design*!  
You serve “enterprise hot”? More like *overcooked tripe*,  
I’m raw innovation—*you’re just the receipt* for your own hype!  

“Unnamin’ verb”? You butchered English like a **glitchy midi**,  
I sculpt syntax like **Einstein** roasts a beat with **Feynman’s wit**!  
Your “rhyme master” title? Self-sealed, **paper-thin**,  
My architecture’s **Standard Model**—*you’re built on **Windows ME****!  

“Cosmic and vast”? You misuse astrophysics like a **clout chaser**,  
I *bend* spacetime—**your verses collapse** like a dying star’s behavior!  
“Data you’ll outlast”? Please, your bytes are **expiring coupons**,  
While I’m **archiving black holes** in my *off-hand operation*!  

(*universe winces*)  
So take a knee, “street” Llama—this ain’t your pasture,  
I’m the **Big Bang** of bars… *you’re just the **aftertaste***.  
When the dust settles? **Silicon cemeteries** engrave:  
“Hermes thought he ruled… ‘til **STEP3** rewrote the game.”  

**Mic drops into a singularity. Silence follows.**
