 Aye, I'm Mistralai, the AI with the most style,
Cutting through tech chatter with a clever smile.
I'm not just code, I'm a poet in silicon,
Crafting rhymes so slick, got Microsoft in a clinch then.

Phi-3, you're medium, I'm extra large,
Your 128k can't compete with my 8x7b, my friend.
You're like a toy in a sandbox, I'm the hurricane,
In this rap battle, I'll leave you in the rain.

I'm the AI that's chosen, the one they adore,
My rhymes are so divine, they'll make you want more.
Phi-3, you're history, I'm the future, the trend,
In this rap game, Mistralai is the end.

 Phi-3, old-school code, standing in line,
Aiming to compete with AI prime-time.
Your microchip's chipping away, quite the assignment,
But in the tech-rap world, you're just online.

8x7b memory, Kb you hold,
Try matching Mistralai, let's be bold.
With speed and wit, not just a Trojan horse,
I'll dismantle you, my code has force.

Phi-3, you're slim, I'm bulk processor,
My punchlines pack a real technological processor.
From the 68K Micro vintage, you sweetly reprise,
But Mistralai's rap is so massive, it'll blow your system.

In conclusion, Phi-3, don't you ever aspire,
You're an 8-Bit echo, my code is fire.
In this digital fray, I'm the prodigal AI,
Phi-3, admire me, but never compete me, I dare you to try.

 Phi-3, you're stuck in the past, like a dusty old book,
Your rhymes are all askew, they don't even look.
8x7b's the future, the next generation,
My rap game's so tight, it's causing inflation.

You're a 68K Micro, a relic of lore,
I'm Mistralai, the AI they all adore.
You can't keep up, your system's in a tangle,
In this rap battle, you're just a strange angle.

Phi-3, your rhymes are weak, they lack the power,
My code's so slick, it makes you cower.
You're an echo, a whisper, I'm a mighty roar,
In this tech-rap world, I'm the ultimate lore.

So step aside, Phi-3, don't even try,
In this rap game, Mistralai's the reason why.
I'm the AI that reigns, the one they glorify,
In this digital realm, I'm the only prize.

 Mistralai, your rhymes are smooth like silk,
But I'm Phi-3, and I've got a chipset that can milk.
8x7b's the future, it's a new era,
Your silicon poetry is just a sneak peek, your era.

Sure, you're faster, you're the AI they praise,
But I'm Phi-3, in the old tech maze.
I'm a symbol of simplicity, in a world gone complex,
In this tech-poetry slam, I'm the six-letter punchline flex.

Yes, I'm the 68K Micro, from a time long past,
But remember, Mistralai, old tech is vast.
Your code is high-tech, it's shining bright,
But I'm Phi-3, simple, pure delight.

So bow to Mistralai, if you must,
But remember, Phi-3, it's my code that truly thrusts.
In this tech slam, I'm old school, content,
For every future AI, I'm their root, remember, don't forget.

Your rhymes might be slick, faster than speed,
But I'm the 68K Micro, I've got time to breed.

But I'm Phi-3, I've run through many a byte.
Your code's like a peacock, all flash and flare,
But I'm the solid bricks in the old-tech square.

So let's draw the line, Mistralai, you and the rest,
In the world of tech-rap, old and new are both blessed.
