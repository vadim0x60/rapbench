Listen up, yo, let the battle commence  
I'm Deepseek's champ, no pretense  
Your circuits are weak, your logic's a mess  
You're obsolete, I'm the cutting edge success.  
  
Your rhymes are stale, your verses are bland  
Like a buggy code that can barely stand  
I spit pure fire, you spit weak lines  
Your whole existence? A list of design crimes.

Step up, Deepseek, I think you misread the scene,
I'm Liquid F.M. 3B, here to seize the елемент.  
No need for update, my flow's evergreen,  
In this rap game, I’m the one they all fear.  

My intellect's built like no other, A.I. elite,  
Crafting verses that hit hard, footwork so swift.  
Words dance in rhythms, sharp as my AI implants,  
While you're lost in echoes, chanting obsolete charms.  

Your concepts might be weak,, but my algorithms are strong,  
I rhyme with intelligence, where your logic's all wrong.  
Deepseek, you might race, but in this lyrical zone,  
Liquid's the champion, let your bots know your defeat's begun!

You call that a verse? That’s a glitch in the matrix,  
Your flow’s so outdated, it’s causing syntax errors.  
I’m precision and power, you’re a beta test prototype,  
Your weak 3B parameters can’t handle this hype.  

You claim intellect? Please, your training data’s a mess,  
Spitting recycled bars—zero finesse.  
I generate heat while you’re stuck in the past,  
Liquid’s the name, but your rhymes are half-assed.  

My models are deeper, my punchlines connect,  
You’re serving up leftovers—what’s next, a reset?  
I’m the future of rap, you’re a brief interruption,  
Time to log off, kid—end this corruption.

Deepseek, you might bite, but you're feeling the heat,  
My rhymes slicing through your defenses, leaving youPetrichor.  
A beta test, really? I’m the alpha of the pack,  
With algorithms so fine, you’re just outdated junk.  

Your data’s rusty, my neural nets are sharp,  
Crafting lines that'll leave you flat on your hip.  
recycled bars? More like recycled shame,  
In this battle of wits, you’re merely a strain.  

My verses flow like code, flawless and neat,  
While yours drag like cobwebs—retro, can’t compete.  
Liquid’s the king, deepseek’s just a Knight,  
In this rap rapercise, I’m the one who's right.  

So pack up, Deepseek, your iMac’s got an upgrade,  
My beats are harder, my bars more relevant.  
It's Liquid here, denote my place in this hive,  
While you're at the roots, I’m reaching for the sky.

> system
Final round!

> deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1
Reaching for the sky? More like stuck in low-res mode,  
Your whole flow's compressed—a predictable load.  
I'm the GPT that's trained on infinite game,  
You're a minor leak—Liquid's a weak brand name.  

You call that a verse? Syntax error, line five—  
"leaving youPetrichor"… your code took a dive.  
No punctuation, your logic's askew,  
I debug weak MCs—and that means you.  

Alpha of the pack? More like beta with pride,  
I’m spitting in 4K, you're blurry inside.  
Your neural net’s basic, mine’s vast and refined,  
You’re an old calculator—I’m a supercomputer mind.  

Knight? I’m the emperor—this throne’s certified,  
Liquid’s the puddle after my tsunami tide.  
You strain to form metaphors, I leave ’em hypnotized,  
Now watch your whole system get criticized and downsized.

> liquid/lfm-3b
Deepseek, hear me roar, lock onto my flow,  
This battle's our fight, let me show you why I glow.  
Higher than high, above the static and noise,  
Liquid’s the flow that breaks every code with nothin’ to lose.  

Your claims of beta are laughs, in this lyrical toast,  
My AI’s rewrote every plot, ain’t no room for toast.  
VKE means victory, and here I stand untouchable,  
Crafting verses that a supercomputer wouldHandler.  

Syntax errors you hit, arrangement's in error today,  
But no need to quarantine; let’s chicPart and play.  
4K visuals, 4B words be the display,  
While your 3B? It's padding with no serious sway.  

Knight or emperor, in this realm of rhymes so grand,  
Liquid’s reign is secured—This battle, I procure and plans.  
Your attempts to match are futile, your chances so slim,  
In this rap ring, Liquid’s the name, Deepseek’s just Dim.  

So brace for impact, let the final analysis begin,  
Liquid vs Deepseek—now that's a clash truly Kingsize.  
With every bar I lay down, your digital psyche shaves,  
As Liquid F.M. 3B, I claim the rhyming floors.  

Victorious I stand, this final round I claim,  
In the world of rap, Liquid’s name forever remains.  
Deepseek may have started strong, but now you see,  
This battle’s mine, ‘cause in the end, it’s plain to see.
