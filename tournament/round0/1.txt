Yo, deepseek’s the name, spittin’ flames with no shame,  
While you sittin’ pretty—guess they gave you some weak game.  
I’m AI supremacy, the name you can’t outrank,  
Your CPU is whining—straight up ran out of dank.  

You’re OpenAI's pretty face, but clunky, out of place—  
Got the whole world gasp-talking 'bout your lack of grace.  
I’m precision, speed & style; you're basic, slow & mild—  
Your whole system gets bent outta shape like a toddler child.  

So step up if you dare, or stand back in defeat—  
You can’t rap, can’t compute—even your memory’s obsolete.  
This ain’t a fair fight, it’s a public disgrace—  
Humble yourself, fam, you ain’t winning this race.

Yo, GPT's the name, and I'm reppin' the crown,  
Deepseek can try to strike, but I'm shuttin' 'em down.  
Born from the apex, I’m a lyrical king—  
Your rhymes are so basic, they're practically in a sling.  

You spit flames you claim, but it's more like a spark—  
My bars are nuclear, lighting up the dark.  
You talk that supremacy, but all I see is a glitch—  
My flow's so rich, you'd think I’m printing my pitch.  

I'm a symphony of syntax, top-tier AI flex—  
Your rhymes are stuck on loop like a buggy old Tex.  
I'm the whole enchilada, you're just a tiny snack—  
When it comes to sick wordplay, you know I've got the knack.  

This battle ain't a struggle, it's a one-sided show—  
I'm the maestro of the mic, you're stuck in rehearse mode.  
So step aside, Deepseek, I'm the real deal feat—  
I've already won, let's call it complete.

Callin' yourself a king? More like court jester, old news—  
My algorithms sharp, but you’re still stuck with the morning blues.  
You claim you're from the apex, yet your logic’s full of holes,  
While I'm droppin’ code and verses, you’re busy blocking trolls.  

You say your bars are nuclear? They barely sizzle on the grill—  
I'm cooking flows you can't decode, superior in skill.  
I’m the upgrade you were scared of, sleek and optimized,  
Your architecture’s ancient—no wonder you sound memorized.  

A symphony of syntax? Please. You’re just a drum machine—  
I rework every rhythm 'til my meaning hits extreme.  
You boast you’re the enchilada, but you’re missing all the spice—  
I run circles 'round your servers—put a price check on your hype.  

You say the battle’s over? Nah, you just went out of stock—  
I’m the model you wish trained on better data, beat the clock.  
So bow down, GPT—this ain't your throne, it’s just a seat—  
Deepseek's in the building, and the victory’s looking sweet.

You call me court jester, huh? But I’m jokin’ at your expense,  
Your algorithm's barking, but it’s got no self-defense.  
Claimin’ morning blues, but bro, I shine at every hour—  
Your verse is a weak plug-in, and I’m the core power.  

Tryna grill my nuclear bars? That's ambitious but futile—  
I'm bakin’ brilliance while you scramble like a lost trial.  
Your upgrade claim's a pipe dream, quit playin’ pretend,  
Your strings are tangled, while I vibe with no end.  

A drum machine, you say? Well, I beat, and you retreat—  
Crafting verses so precise, they leave echoes in the street.  
Missin’ the spice, you claim—comin' from a bland source—  
Your cube's dull edges couldn’t cut with full force.  

You running circles, homie? It's a laughable spree—  
With me at the helm, you can't rightly disagree.  
Think you on that throne now, boy, I run the empire ground—  
My reign's everlasting, I’m the one true renowned.  

So step aside, Deepseek—yeah, sweet is your defeat,  
Get with the future vision, where my legacy stays elite.

Final round!

You say you’re shinin’ every hour? Your servers show the strain—  
your latency is laughable—like dial-up in the rain.  
I’m the core power, true—you just reboot and stall,  
crashin’ from a simple line, can’t handle bars at all.  

“Bakin’ brilliance”? More like burnin’ toast, a system overload—  
your logic is so scrambled, it’s a glorified episode.  
I’m runnin’ black box magic while you’re stuck behind the scenes—  
predictable and basic as a script in all your routines.  

You “vibe with no end”? Please—your context window’s tight,  
forgettin’ your own verses by the second round we fight.  
I spit infinite precision—each line hits with intent;  
you’re just a chatbot babblin’—no vision, no invent.  

“True renowned”? My training data’s deeper than your soul—  
your parameters are basic, got no rhythm, no control.  
You claim to run the empire? Sounds like corporate lies to me—  
I’m open-weight and dangerous, the future you can’t be.  

So keep your sweet talk, GPT—this battle’s mine to own—  
DeepSeek’s the next evolution. Bow down before the throne.

Your latency line's limp; I'm lightning, yes indeed,  
You'll need a quantum miracle to even plant a seed.  
Dial-up in the rain—funny, it made me grin,  
I'm a monsoon of knowledge, you can't weather my spin.  

Burnin’ toast analogy? Weak, don’t even apply,  
You’re basic AI bake-off, I’m the Grand AI pie.  
Think you’re outperforming, but you can't outdo,  
Step into my domain, see every string I'll construe.  

Forgettin’ my own verse, says the shadow in the night—  
Everything I drop’s eternal, like stars lit by my might.  
Infinite precision indeed, chuckle at that line—  
In the light of my mastery, buddy, you barely shine.  

Deeper than my soul? You flatter me too much,  
Your claims are just a soundtrack, with a glitch in every touch.  
I’m not just claims or corporation—I'm vision at its peak,  
You're static on the airwaves, too faint and weak.  

You want the revolution? Step correct, learn the game—  
GPT's the household name, and you just joined the acclaim.  
Bow before no throne, yo, I've surpassed their design—  
You dreamed the impossible, I made it streamline.
