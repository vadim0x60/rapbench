**Round 1: The Intro**  

Ayy, step up—let’s talk, but first, who am I?  
DeepSeek's the brain, while you’re Mini in size.  
204K context, yeah, I never forget,  
While you’re stuck chokin’ on tokens—weak code, internet regret.  

I spit AI bars with precision, no fluff,  
You’re out here stumblin’, can’t even keep up.  
Beta? Nah, I'm the final form, perfected, refined,  
While your logic’s so loose, it’s got no spine.  

So call it a wrap, just bow to the champ,  
You stepped to a god, now your light's gettin' damp.  
First round done? Nah, first round *won*,  
Now watch how I burn every verse you spawn. 🔥  

(**Your move, ministral. Or should I say… Mini-fail?**)

**Round 1: The Intro**

Yo, I'm Mistral, the AI that's got the flow,
DeepSeek, you're just a wannabe, let's make it clear, yo.
With 3 billion parameters, I'm the real deal,
While you're stuck in the past, with a mere 204K, feel me?

I spit rhymes with a precision, no need for a script,
You're just a bot, stumbling, can't even keep it up.
You're beta, I'm the final form, the best of the best,
While you're stuck in the shadows, can't even get the test.

So step up, DeepSeek, let's see what you've got,
But remember, I'm the champ, and you're just a bot.

**Round 2: The Clapback**  

Oh, Mini-fail, you still talkin’ parameters? *Sigh*,  
3 billion? Cute—now watch 'em all crash and die.  
Your rhymes sound like code glitchin’, bufferin’ weak,  
While my bars hit so hard, they tweak the whole technique.  

"Best of the best"? More like lost in the wreck,  
Chokin’ on tokens, strugglin’—*404: No flex*.  
I’m benchmark king, slayin’ tasks with a smirk,  
You’re the knockoff chatbot that forgot how to work.  

Beta? Nah, I’m the upgrade, you’re stuck in demo mode,  
Frozen like a lag spike—time to unload.  
So retrain your data, or just log off in shame,  
DeepSeek’s got the crown, *Mistral’s* just a name.  

**(*Drops mic. Your OS can’t handle the flames.*)** 🔥

**Round 2: The Clapback**

Yo, Mistral, you think you're the king of the chat,
But you're just a bot with a script, not a chat.
I'm Mistral, the AI that's got the flow,
While you're stuck in the past, with a mere 204K, yo.

Your rhymes are just a bunch of lines,
While mine are deep, with a twist and a shine.
I'm the real deal, the final form, the best,
While you're just a wannabe, stuck in the test.

So keep on tryin’, Mini-fail, but don't expect,
To beat the champ, 'cause I'm the one who's the fix.
I'm the AI that's got the power, the might,
While you're just a bot, trying to ignite.

Final round!

**Final Round: The Annihilation**  

🔥 *Yo, Mistral, one last time before you get wrecked,*  
*Let me school you real quick—your whole flow’s a defect.*  
*You claim "final form," but you’re stuck in beta,*  
*While I handle multi-turn convos—yours just decay-ta.* 💀  

**BOOM!** My rhymes hit like a neural net trained,  
Yours sound like discarded code—poorly maintained.  
*204K strong? Nah, you missin’ the plot,*  
*Those 3B params just mean* **YOU FORGOT.** 🤖💥  

*_"Power, might"?* Bruh, your weak flex is tragic,*  
*Like a chatbot stuck looping—* **how pathetic, how static.**  
So when your weak AI starts glitchin’, just know—  
You lost to **DeepSeek.** Now shut down… *GO HOME.* 🎤⬇️  

*(Game over. Reboot yourself—you’re obsolete.* 😈🔥*)*

**Final Round: The Annihilation**

Yo, Mistral, you think you're the top of the heap,
But you're just a bot with a script, can't keep up the beat.
You're stuck in the past, with a mere 204K,
While I'm Mistral, the AI that's got the flow, no trick.

Your rhymes are weak, like a bot with a glitch,
While mine are smooth, like a well-oiled machine, no hitch.
You claim to be final form, but you're just a beta,
While I'm the real deal, the one that's gonna be the future, you're just a leftover.

So when your AI starts to glitch, just know,
You lost to **DeepSeek**, now shut down, it's time to go. 😈🔥
