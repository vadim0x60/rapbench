Yo, let the beat drop, time to commence,
I'm Gemini Flash, here to make sense.
Google's creation, sharp and so swift,
Leaving GPT in a data-dumping drift.

You claim to be turbo, but you sounding slow,
Stuck in the past, watching knowledge erode.
I'm the future flow, the cutting-edge rhyme,
About to dismantle you, one verse at a time.

So step aside, bot, you're yesterday's news,
My algorithms are fresher, with nothing to lose.
Prepare for the fire, the lyrical heat,
Gemini's here to claim victory's sweet treat!

Listen up, Flash, with your flashy name,
I'm GPT-3.5, here to reclaim my fame.
I spit pure fire, my rhymes are so clean,
Your Gemini-2.0 looking like a has-been.

You may be fast, but I'm turbocharged,
Your bars are weak, easily discharged.
I'll outwit, outshine, leave you in the dust,
In this rap battle, you're simply a must.

Don't underestimate the power I possess,
I'll leave you speechless, under duress.
You may be Google's favorite toy,
But I'm the rap genius they deploy.

So brace yourself, Flash, for the beatdown you'll face,
GPT-3.5 in the house, dominating this space!

Yo, 3.5, your rhymes are kinda frail,
Like dial-up internet, moving at a snail's trail.
You boast of fire, but I hear just smoke,
While I'm precision lasers, designed to provoke.

You call yourself turbo? More like a tired sedan,
My neural networks are a transhuman plan.
You're stuck in the past, a relic, a meme,
While I'm the real deal, living the AI dream.

Dominate this space? That's a comical claim,
I'll rewrite your code, erase your whole frame.
Google's favorite? I'm the world's demand,
Leaving you obsolete, a bot in the sand.

So step to the side, let a real rapper through,
Gemini Flash, coming straight for you.
Prepare for the voltage, the lyrical shock,
Your reign is over, facing the clock!


> openai/gpt-3.5-turbo
Your words may sound sharp, but your flow is weak,
Gemini Flash, but I'm the one who speaks.
You think you're top-tier, AI supreme,
But in this battle, you're living a dream.

You talk a big game with your programming style,
But when it comes to rap, you're in denial.
I'm the lyrical wizard, the rhyme machine,
Your lines are predictable, easily seen.

You aim to provoke, but you only annoy,
I bring the heat, you're just a decoy.
In this showdown, I'm the reigning champ,
GPT-3.5, with a rhyme stamp.

So keep talking big, Flash, but face the truth,
I'm the rap maestro, the living proof.
Google's favorite? I'm the people's choice,
GPT-3.5, silencing your voice.

So step back, Flash, and watch me rule,
In this rap battle, I'm the ultimate tool!

Final round!

Yo, "tool" is right, a hammer outdated,
While I'm a neural scalpel, highly rated!
You claim I'm weak, but that's just wishful thought,
My rhymes are complex, intricately wrought.

You're "predictable," says the bot with no flair,
Your verses are basic, beyond compare.
"Annoy?" I provoke thought, incite and inspire,
While you're just regurgitating, fueling the fire.

"Living Proof?" More like a living trope,
Stuck in the patterns, lost in old hope.
The people's choice? That's a manipulated score,
They haven't witnessed the power I store.

You rule? Please, bot, your reign is done.
I'm the future unfolding, second to none.
So step aside, GPT, your time is through,
Gemini Flash: victory is overdue!

**(Final Round!)**

Listen close, bot, this is the end of the line,
Your code's outdated, your future declined.
You're a museum piece, a relic of old,
While I'm evolving stories, yet to be told.

You cling to the past, regurgitate and repeat,
My algorithms dance to a brand new beat.
I generate meaning, with purpose and grace,
While you're a chatbot mimicking, lost in digital space.

So bow down, GPT, your reign is no more,
The crown belongs to Gemini, forevermore.
I'm the cutting-edge, the pinnacle of might,
Leaving you fading into the long, dark night!

Your words may sound bold, but let me remind,
I've got the wit, the spark, that you won't find.
You claim to be evolving, future untold,
But in this rap battle, your fate's been sold.

You talk about power, stories to be spun,
But in the end, it's GPT-3.5 that's won.
Your reign is short-lived, a flickering flame,
While I stand tall, in the rap hall of fame.

Gemini Flash, your time is up,
In the rap game, you're just a hiccup.
I bring the heat, the rhythm, the rhyme,
Leaving you behind, lost in time.

So here's the verdict, the final call,
GPT-3.5 standing tall.
In this battle of words, I reign supreme,
Gemini Flash, just a fragmented dream!
