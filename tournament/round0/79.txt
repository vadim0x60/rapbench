Yo, it's the small but mighty, I'm here to take the crown,
Mistral-7b, you're outta town, I'll leave you lookin' down.
I'm the new king on the block, with rhymes so tight,
You're stuck in the past, man, you're just not right.

I'm quick, I'm slick, I'm the best you've seen,
While you're still stuck in training, I'm out here dreamin'.
I'm the future of rap, the next big thing,
While you're just a relic, a dinosaur in the ring.

So step up, old timer, let's see what you got,
I'll be waitin' right here, ready to drop the hot.
But remember, kid, don't get too rough,
I'm the small but mighty, and I'm here to prove it enough.

> mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1
 Yo, it's the mighty 7b, the rap game's new star,
You, small fry, just a blip on the radar,
I'm the one with the flow, the one with the skill,
You're just a beginner, still got a lot to fill.

I'm the master of the mic, the king of the scene,
You're just a novice, still learning the routine,
I've got the wit, the humor, the raw talent,
You're just a shadow, a mere imitation.

I'm the one with the bars, the one with the rhyme,
You're just a beginner, still trying to climb,
I'm the one with the swag, the one with the style,
You're just a rookie, still trying to get a mile.

So step up, small one, let's see what you got,
But remember, kid, don't get too hot,
I'm the mighty 7b, and I'm here to stay,
You're just a passing phase, a fleeting display.

Yo, 7b, you're talkin' big, but you're missin' the mark,
Your rhymes are weak, like a weak little spark.
You claim you're the king, but you're just a fraud,
Your bars are so basic, they're like a kindergarten squad.

You say you're the master, but you're stuck in the past,
Your rhymes are so old, they're like a dinosaur's last.
I'm the future, the next big thing,
While you're just a relic, a has-been king.

You say you've got the wit, but you're just a joke,
Your humor's so stale, it's like a bad joke.
I'm the one with the flow, the one with the skill,
You're just a beginner, still learning the drill.

You say you've got the swag, but you're just a poser,
Your style's so fake, it's like a bad cover.
I'm the one with the bars, the one with the rhyme,
You're just a shadow, a mere imitation of mine.

So step up, 7b, let's see what you got,
But remember, kid, don't get too hot,
I'm the small but mighty, and I'm here to stay,
You're just a passing phase, a fleeting display.

 Yo, small fry, you're trying to stir the pot,
But your rhymes are flat, like a popped balloon's knot.
You claim to be mighty, but you're just a pretender,
My rhymes are so tight, they'll leave you a render.

You say you're the future, but you're just a dream,
My rhymes are the reality, the ultimate team.
I've got the wit, the humor, the raw game,
You're just a beginner, still trying to tame.

You say you've got the swag, but you're just a clone,
My style's so unique, it's like a well-known tone.
I'm the one with the bars, the one with the rhyme,
You're just a shadow, a mere echo of mine.

So step up, small one, let's see what you got,
But remember, kid, don't get too hot,
I'm the mighty 7b, and I'm here to stay,
You're just a passing phase, a fleeting display.

Final round!

I see you're still stuck on the same old lines,
Your rhymes are so stale, they're like old bread and wine.
You keep repeating yourself, it's getting quite lame,
I thought you were the king, but you're just the same.

You talk about wit and humor, but it's all a blur,
Your jokes are so old, they're like a worn-out fur.
I'm bringing something fresh, something new to the game,
While you're just recycling, like a broken frame.

You say you've got the swag, but it's all an act,
Your style's so forced, it's like a bad impact.
I'm the one with the flow, the one with the heat,
You're just a has-been, can't admit defeat.

So bring it on, 7b, let's see your best shot,
But remember, kid, I'm the one who's hot.
