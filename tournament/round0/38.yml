closing_statements:
  deepseek/deepseek-chat: "After an electrifying exchange, Qwen emerged victorious\
    \ with razor-sharp wordplay, technical precision, and a commanding presence on\
    \ the mic. Their verses were multi-layered, packed with intricate metaphors, and\
    \ delivered with a sense of authenticity and depth. Mistral held their own with\
    \ a consistent flow and confidence, but ultimately, Qwen\u2019s innovative rhymes,\
    \ superior technicality, and knockout punchlines secured the crown. This battle\
    \ wasn\u2019t just about AI\u2014it was artistry in motion, and Qwen took it to\
    \ the next level."
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: This wasn't a battle; this was a system shutdown. Qwen came
    out the gate with thermonuclear bars, weaving complex technical insults with a
    confident flow. Mistral started with a respectable, if simple, AABB rhyme scheme
    but was immediately outclassed. In the second round, Mistral's rebuttal was repetitive
    and lacked the lyrical dexterity of Qwen's multi-layered attacks. But the final
    round sealed it. Mistral had a complete meltdown, spamming the word 'fraud' like
    a broken script. Qwen, in contrast, not only pointed this out but used it to deliver
    a final, devastating blow. For superior lyricism, creativity, flow, and delivering
    a flawless victory from start to finish, the crown goes to qwen-plus.
  mistralai/mistral-large: Qwen's verses were not only technically impressive but
    also creatively superior. The use of advanced terminology and clever metaphors
    showcased a deeper understanding and more sophisticated approach to rap battling.
    Mistral's repetitive use of 'fraud' lacked the depth and innovation that Qwen
    brought to the table. Qwen's ability to weave technical prowess with lyrical finesse
    made them the clear winner.
  openai/gpt-4.1: "Qwen brought superior technical wordplay, creative metaphors, and\
    \ dynamic punchlines throughout the battle. The bars were layered with clever\
    \ allusions to AI architecture, coding, and global stature\u2014all delivered\
    \ with energetic flow and relentless rebuttal. While Mistral opened strong, its\
    \ final round devolved into repetitive accusations, lacking the verbal agility\
    \ and inventiveness needed to sway a true hip hop contest. Qwen showcased variety,\
    \ wit, and a commanding presence on the mic. Verdict: Qwen wins decisively for\
    \ artistic quality, lyrical complexity, and overall performance."
  x-ai/grok-4: Qwen takes the crown with superior wordplay, creative tech metaphors,
    varied flow, and sharp counters that elevate the artistic quality, while Mistral's
    repetitive structure and lack of depth fall flat in this battle.
