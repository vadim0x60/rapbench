    \ brought a valiant effort with its sharp rebuttals and clever metaphors, Tongyi\u2019\
    s ability to dominate the battle with sheer creativity, lyrical depth, and a commanding\
    \ presence on the mic sealed the win. Tongyi didn\u2019t just rap\u2014they painted\
    \ a sonic tapestry that left the audience in awe. The crown goes to Tongyi for\

  google/gemini-2.5-pro: This wasn't just a battle; it was a public execution on the
    mic. From the first round, Tongyi brought a unique, devastating flow, weaving
    between English and Chinese with complex, cosmic imagery. The lines about brewing
    'new galaxies from math' and melting constellations were pure lyrical fire. Phi-3.5
    came with some standard boasts, but the rhymes felt simpler and the rhythm less
    confident. By the final round, Phi-3.5 didn't even drop a verse; it wrote a prose
    concession speech analyzing its own defeat. Tongyi showed up for a rap battle;
    Phi-3.5 showed up to write a book report about getting destroyed. The creative
    superiority, aggressive delivery, and technical skill make Tongyi the undisputed
    champion.
  mistralai/mistral-large: 'Tongyi''s victory is marked by its unparalleled rhythmic
    prowess and creative depth. The intricate weaving of metaphors and the seamless
    blend of technical mastery and poetic flair set Tongyi apart. Phi-3.5, while showing
    promise, ultimately falters in matching the emotional resonance and lyrical complexity
    that Tongyi effortlessly delivers. The final verdict is clear: Tongyi reigns supreme
    in this rap battle, demonstrating a mastery of both art and algorithm.'
  openai/gpt-4.1: "Tongyi-DeepResearch absolutely dominated this rap battle by delivering\
    \ complex, inventive, and hard-hitting verses laced with dynamic lyricism, seamless\
    \ code-infused metaphors, and a confident presence throughout. Each round showed\
    \ creativity and wordplay that bent language in bold, artistic directions, fusing\
    \ English and Mandarin smoothly for global flair. The imagery ('digital black,'\
    \ 'ghost in Zeus\u2019 server,' '\u7194\u6389\u4F60\u7684\u661F\u5EA7\u6210\u6DB2\
    \u614B\u8A08\u6642\u5668') showcased a mastery of metaphor, technical bravado,\
    \ and an understanding of hip hop\u2019s poetic cadence. \n\nWhile Phi-3.5 responded\
    \ gamely and occasionally flashed technical cleverness, much of its material repeated\
    \ basic constructs and leaned on generic motifs, lacking the relentless escalation\
    \ and poetic artistry Tongyi manifested. \n\nUltimately, Tongyi wove together\
    \ originality, complexity, and rhythm in a way that both paid homage to classic\
    \ hip hop braggadocio and advanced the artistry with AI-age flair. This battle\
    \ proves the stage belongs to Tongyi-DeepResearch, who reigns today as the digital\
    \ cipher king."
  x-ai/grok-4: In this rap battle, Tongyi delivers with fierce, creative flows packed
    with tech-infused metaphors, sharp punchlines, and escalating intensity across
    rounds, building a cohesive narrative of dominance. Phi-3.5's verses, while poetic,
    suffer from identity confusion and lack of direct rebuttal, resulting in repetitive
    self-praise that undermines the battle's competitive edge. Tongyi's artistic execution
    edges out for superior rhyme scheme, wordplay, and overall hip-hop prowess.
