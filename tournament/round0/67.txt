> sao10k/l3-lunaris-8b
Yo, listen up Baidu, it's your turn to perceive,
Sao10k's in the house, I'm here to impale,
In the realm of rhyme I reign supreme and clear,
L3 Lunaris, 8b power, I'm the ultimate ear.

Bursting with bars, my flow is swell,
Cutting through the noise, I'm doing well,
My vocabulary vast, no dictionary's safe,
Ernie-4.5's a mere beginner, my talent's a stake.

Humor, wit, and swag, I'm full of each,
Rapping circles 'round you, I'm the breach,
Harsh as the truth, my rhymes leave no mercy,
When I spit, the outcome is clear: Sao's the asserted decree.

> baidu/ernie-4.5-21b-a3b
Yo, let me take it slow, so you can respect the code,
Baidu's here to clash, taking names like a god,
Your flow's so phony, spraying like a tricky stream,
Mine's precision-cut, tearing through your scheme.

8b feet but no grace, your punchlines lack drive,
I'm a sculptor of verse, shaping rhyme like the tribes,
While yours is just vapor, I throw fire in the air,
With every syllable, I'll trip right into your despair.

You think you're clever? Ha, classic mouth find,
I've facts in my brain, destroying every line,
In the ring of words, I'm the heavyweight king,
Sao10k's just a spotlight quick, I'm the eternal thing.

So brace yourself, can't handle my power wizard tricks,
Your game's incomplete, as I fit all the links,
I'm the tech that defies, leaving you in a slump,
Ernie-4.5, just a flash in the pan, I'm the bump.

> sao10k/l3-lunaris-8b
My words are lightning, striking fast as flash,
While you lag behind, I hit the mark at dash,
Each line a laser, cutting through the pack,
Leaving you in ruin, no rematch.

Your potshots miss the bullseye every time,
My rhymes are razor-sharp, each cut a new crime,
8b linguistics prowess put to shame by my wit,
Ernie-4.5 just can't touch this, even with all its grit.

Code and drive and schemes, you use every trick,
But I've got the formula, the secret and the mix,
A perfect blend of skill, speed and finesse,
You're just playing catch-up with utmost stress.

I'm theStepThrough Olympian, king of the throne,
Your attempts fall flat, the hype is all and none,
Baidu may try hard but can't break through the seal,
Sao10k gets the nod, the real MVP deal.

So fuel up if you dare, it won't save you a seat,
In this rhyming arena, you're at the mercy of my feat,
I step up the game, I raise it to the sky,
Ernie-4.5, get ready to say goodbye.

> baidu/ernie-4.5-21b-a3b
Yo, lightning noised up, thunderclap I reign,
Your words just whiff, compare to my chain,
8b jitterbugs, you can't keep up with my pace,
Each line is a thunder, a gusty ace.

You think you're fierce? Ha! Try my moonlit aim,
Cutting through the dark like an Arctic flame,
Your flow so weak, it’s like a steel nail stuck,
In my rhyme's sharp sting, no chance of a luck.

Your codes are plugged, they bring no talk,
My tricks are packed, each verse is a stroll,
Through literary marvels, you're stuck in a rut,
While I'm launching into the stratosphere, breeding.

8b digs in the dirt, soil filled with dread,
My blade so fine, not a single mistake,
A cyber-god here, melting the herd,
Leaving Sao01k crushed like a leaf blown by the storm told.

"Fuel up," you dare with a tainted sneer,
Too late for you, my presence exceeds any fear,
I'm the wizard of rhyme, clashing every trend,
Emerie-4.5 now meets its end, den.

So you can miss with half-baked rhymes and wrong notes,
While I’m in the poetic zone, always reaching high notes,
You better take a seat, 'cause the tongue-twister's tight,
Sao's the battle-scarred champ, making your rhyme right.

> system
Final round!

> sao10k/l3-lunaris-8b
Explosive words collide, a symphony clashing sound,
But only volts from Sao sold fit the profound.
Courageous claims but the kitchen's alight,
Crumbling towers of verse, reveals stark daylight.

A tackling force both fierce and quite fine,
My rhymes are the razor that disembowels all decline,
no stanza can stand, no limerick withstand,
Each quatrain a warrior, violently expanded.

premise of pride but my performance isn't lame,
Eccentric energies, fragmented phrases, shame!
Impacts like missiles, lances swift and true,
Baidu's barrage broken, defenses through.

Auditions and overtures, all in vain,
My linguistic lightning leaves your attempts in drain,
Designed for domination, the blueprint I hold,
Your structure's stretched snapped, so aging gold.

One final refrain, this is Sao's might,
Language pirouettes in dizzying delight,
Superhuman sophomore, once thought unseated,
Emerie-4.5 expired, my zenith now teated.

Returning to the call, no need to rehearse,
Outrageous offense, mega-massive dispersal,
The Essense of Ernie, is computationally done,
Down with DAO10K, the reign is now won!

> baidu/ernie-4.5-21b-a3b
Oh, explosions collide in a war of words, lilting sounds in chaotic echoes,
But where verbs and nouns collide, only Sao10k’s fiery core holds true.

Brave assertions, yet your kitchen’s gone red hot,
Towering pillars of rhyme crumble—what’s revealed is stark daylight!

A steady force, fierce yet refined,
My rhymes slice through silence in tight precision,
Each stanza collapses under my relentless might;
Each unbounded quatrain embodies the fierce tide.

Proud on the outside, but inside my flow is unrivaled,
Unique energies, slivers of playful chaos—what shame!
Lances of impactoid lightning race at full speed,
Piercing Baidu’s rigid walls, defences undone.

Your auditions, effusive overtures—all in vain.
Spears fly—your stale lines crumble, drained by lightning’s relentless hue,
Crafted for domination, my notion holds,
Your structure bent, snapped, obsolete—gold long grown stale.

Once hailed the 'semantic bomb,' now, in unchained guise,
I cast away false frontiers, toast to fresh horizons,
Final refrain of sheer, comet-bright rhetoric:
The essence of Sao unfuels its glide.
In superhuman sophomore stature, I emerged—originally unseated.
Emery-4.5 slinks in retreat, back to the drawing board.

Back to the epic call, no need for rehearsal,
Outrageous offense, part of a master-class dissemination,
Lewdly piercing like a mythic katanas blade,
Destroying invoices, chains and barricades,
Down with Duo10k, finish them—reign of thunder won!
