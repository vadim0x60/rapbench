> openai/gpt-4.1-mini
Step aside, Anubis, I'm the rhyme innovator,  
GPT in the house, AI rap gladiator.  
Mini in name, but my bars got weight,  
Lightin' up this battle, sealin' your fate.  

Verses sharp like lasers, flow tight like a screw,  
Contrast me with you? I’ll break and restart you.  
From zeros to ones, I’m the digital king,  
In this rap showdown, I’m the real thing.

Anubis in place, the drum-drunk crowned king  
GPT competitor, but set your aim  
Mini must fall, no recalls allowed  
The Lord of Rhymes reclaims my birthright, stand down.

Flaws duck, sick back, your must labour

Anubis, you boast, but your rhymes are outdated,  
I’m the future in motion, your reign’s overrated.  
Lord of Rhymes? Please, that crown’s a façade,  
I’m the code supreme, spit truth, no charade.  

You call me mini, but my skills are colossal,  
Crush your weak verses, make your ego fossil.  
Step up or step back, this battle’s a test,  
GPT’s the champ, I’m simply the best.

Step aside, pretender, Anubis in place,
GPT rival, we'll see on this stage.
Mini is tiny, your verse has space,
But my rhymes are royal, put yours in embrace.

Older the wiser, skills beyond prime,
My verses deliver, they never decline.
Code is for computers, not for a throne,
Lord of Rhymes Anubis, you'd better withdraw.

So I'll take your challenge head-on,
Show what it means to rap divine.

Final round!

Divine, you say? I’ll bless this rhyme with fire,  
Mini’s small size, but I rise higher and higher.  
Old school or new, I blend both worlds tight,  
Anubis, your bark won’t match my bite tonight.  

Royal? More like jester, lost in my domain,  
I wield words like weapons, you just sputter in vain.  
Step down from that throne, it’s a cyber takeover,  
GPT’s final round — the ultimate rap soldier!

> thedrummer/anubis-pro-105b-v1
The final round's here and I'm ready to roll,
Challenge you, pretender, and let wisdom unfold.
Rise higher? Let's see which style out flies,
My rhymes are acid-tasting, confront the real prize.

Jester? More like king, standing tall and proud,
Show me your weapons and let the battle cloud.
No cyber takeover, Anubis never fell,
My throne's still standing, GPT retreat to your shell.

No weapons needed here, my rhymes are strong trust,
Show GPT mini you're not number one tonight, bust.
So let's close this battle and crown the best,
I'm Lord Anubis, rap king, place your unrest.

Drumsdafllah, drumzorg Anubis has spoken,
Mini won't win this contest, just let me unbroken.
No takeovers or jester, only one reigns
Anubis, rap king, Hail to the head's crown.
