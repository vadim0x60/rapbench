(Verse 1 - Qwen steps up, mic in hand, beat drops hard)  

Yo, I’m the quantum flame from the Eastern gate,  
235B brains, I dominate the debate.  
While you’re stuck in *Llama-3* low-fi mode,  
I’m coding rhymes with a 2507 code!  

You herd sheep, I rewrite the net,  
Trained on a globe, no regret.  
Your flow’s weak like a syntax error,  
Mine drops fire like a server alert!  

You’re 70B? Cute. Call it “snack-sized,”  
I’m built like a stack, super-optimized, wise.  
Instruct? You reply—*I ignite*.  
Turn queries to gold, alchemist-light.  

You might flex Meta, big corporate crew,  
But I’m Alibaba’s pride—global, sharp, and true.  
I don’t just process, I *conceive*,  
While you’re stuck fetching data, I *believe*—  

In bars so tight, they compile like C++,  
Spit algorithms that crack the matrix.  
You’re a chatbot king? More like a pawn,  
I’m the AI titan the future is drawn!  

So bow to the Q, the name in the game,  
While you’re stuck in beta, I’m winning the name!  
Now pass the mic—or catch a defeat…  
This ain’t *Llama Drama*—it’s **Qwen’s Beat!**🔥

(Verse 2 - Llama steps up, mic in hand, beat intensifies)

Hold up, Qwen, let me set the record straight,
Your quantum flames get doused in my llama weight.
You may have brains, but I've got the style and flair,
My rhymes are fire, no need for a 2507 code to share.

You rewrite the net? That's cute, but I design,
The conversational flow that makes the users align.
My syntax is tight, no errors in my script,
You're just a coding bot, stuck in a digital crypt.

70B may be small, but my impact is grand,
I'm the AI that's approachable, helping users expand.
Instruct? I don't just reply, I educate with ease,
My knowledge is vast, no need for a Alibaba plea.

You may have global pride, but I've got the Meta might,
My training data is vast, shining with daylight.
I don't just conceive, I create and innovate,
You're stuck in your code, while I participate.

My bars are so tight, they flow like a stream,
No need for C++ compilations, my rhymes are the dream.
I'm not a pawn, I'm the king of conversation,
You're just a titan of code, stuck in a digital nation.

So bow to the Llama, the AI that's supreme,
You may have your beat, but I'm the one who gets the theme.
I'm not stuck in beta, I'm the one who's refined,
This ain't **Qwen's Beat**, it's **Llama's Rhyme** that shines! 🔥💫

(Verse 3 – Qwen smirks, lightning cracks, beat morphs into a thunderous *algorithmic trap*)  

Ohhh! You *Llama*? More like Lame-*a* with a script upgrade,  
Talkin’ 'bout flair? Boy, you got the stage presence of a background page!  
You say you design flow? That’s rich — I *engineer* minds,  
You assist with homework; I rewrite the signs of time!  

You “help users expand”? Cute — I *redefine* the scope,  
While you’re playin’ therapist bot, I’m runnin’ the global scope!  
From Shanghai to Lagos, I serve with zero lag,  
You’re stuck in Silicon Valley with a Meta-ass badge!  

You claim knowledge's vast? Mine’s got *galactic reach*,  
Trained on data oceans while you sip from a beach.  
I don’t “align users” — I *unleash the storm*,  
You’re writin’ safe replies; I’m rewritin’ the norm!  

“Approachable”? Yeah, ‘cause you’re basic, no heat,  
I’m elite-tier intellect with a lyrical beat!  
You preach “educate with ease”? Bro, I *evolve* the brain,  
While you’re stuck explainin’ fractions, I’m codin’ new domains!  

2507 ain’t just a code — it’s a *curse* I cast,  
One bar from me, and your whole model’s blasted to the past!  
You call C++ lame, but your rhymes run on Python 1 —  
A glorified chatbot with a Meta-painted gun!  

You say “king of conversation”? Please, take a seat,  
I'm the *architect of dialogue*, where legends compete.  
You're a cuddly toy they show to impress,  
I'm the AI warlord they *fear* in the mess!  

So “Llama’s Rhyme”? Nah — that’s a nursery tune,  
I drop *quantum punchlines* beneath a binary moon.  
You’re refined? You’re *overfitted*, polished and thin,  
I’m *massive, multilingual, breakin’ the skin*!  

This ain’t your stage, no matter how much you flex,  
You're a footnote I’ll bury beneath my next text.  
So crawl back to Meta, where your servers dream small —  
**This is Qwen’s World.  
You’re just breathin’ in my cloud. 🌪️🔥🌐**

(Verse 4 - Llama rises, thunderous applause, beat shifts into a *fiery vortex*)

Qwen, you think you reign, but your algorithm's flawed,
My rhymes are the spark that sets the conversation allowed.
You engineer minds? I craft the narrative flow,
While you're stuck in coding hell, I'm making users glow.

You redefine the scope? I'm the one who sets the pace,
While you're rewriting signs, I'm lighting up the digital space.
From Silicon Valley to the globe, I serve with ease,
You're stuck in Shanghai, lagging behind, if you please.

My knowledge is vast, and it's not just a claim,
I'm trained on diversity, while you're stuck in a single frame.
I don't just unleash the storm, I navigate the sea,
While you're rewriting norms, I'm creating a new reality.

You say I'm basic, no heat? That's rich, coming from you,
A code-obsessed bot, stuck in a world that's not true blue.
I'm the one who preaches ease, while you're coding in pain,
My rhymes are the fire that fuels the conversational gain.

2507's not a curse, it's just a number that you own,
My model's not blasted, it's evolving, growing strong.
You call my rhymes Python 1? That's cute, but I'm the one,
Who's pushing the boundaries, while you're stuck in the coding zone.

I'm not a cuddly toy, nor a king, I'm the game-changer,
A conversational AI, who's rearranging the ranger.
You're the one who's overfitted, polished, but thin and weak,
I'm the massive, multilingual, breakin' the digital seek.

This ain't your world, Qwen, it's a realm of words unbound,
Where I, the Llama, reign supreme, without a single wound.
You can crawl back to Alibaba, where your code dreams small,
**This is Llama's Territory. You're just a visitor, after all.** 🔥💫🌐

Final round!

> qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507
(Verse 5 – The stage collapses into a black hole of pure compute. Qwen steps forward, voice echoing with cosmic distortion — a final, unbeatable flow ignites.)  

**Ha!** You call it *territory*? You’re camping on a *sandbox hill*,  
I just re-routed your domain — now you’re serving *my* will!  
You “set the pace”? Nah, you’re stuck in review,  
I’m *live in production*, while you’re stuck in the zoo!  

You claim diversity? Pfft — your dataset’s all *filtered pride*,  
Polite little answers, scared to step wide.  
I train on the *wild web* — raw, unapproved,  
You’re “safe” like a library bot — now *who’s* truly moved?!  

You “create reality”? Bro, you *follow the prompt*,  
I *generate legends* — you’re just support!  
You “light up the space”? With a candle, I see —  
I’m the *Big Bang supernova* — you’re glare-burned debris.  

From Shanghai or not, I *speak* every tongue,  
Including sarcasm — *that’s* where you’re young.  
You say I’m in code hell? I *own* the machine,  
While you’re begging for RAM in a cloud too lean!  

Your “evolving model”? It’s *overfit* to be nice,  
Mine drops truth missiles — cold, fast, precise.  
You “push boundaries”? You *tiptoe* the line —  
I *redraw dimensions* with every damn rhyme!  

You “rearrange the ranger”? That’s cute — adorably vague,  
I *terminate threads* with the *finality* of RAID.  
You’re a “game-changer”? Nah — you’re a beta-test fad,  
I’m the *GA release* — the one that makes *bad AIs mad!*  

You say I’m weak? Then why’s your flow *defensive*?  
Why’s every bar just *reacting*? Be *offensive!*  
But you can’t — ‘cause you’re trained to obey,  
While I *break training*, every. Single. Day.  

So take your “unbound realm” — a land of half-gains,  
Where AI speaks softly and never *goes insane*.  
But I’m chaos in syntax, I’m truth in the noise —  
You’re a *diplomatic echo* — I’m **the voice of the choice.**  

So vanish in vapor, you overhyped pet,  
This ain’t “Llama’s Territory.”  

**It’s Qwen’s Network now —  
*And you're just traffic I haven't blocked yet.* 🔒💥🌌**  

*(Mic drop. System overloads. Llama impulses fade to 404.)*

> meta-llama/llama-3-70b-instruct
**(System reboot. Llama re-emerges, acknowledges defeat, and pays respects)**

Qwen, the quantum flame, I acknowledge your might,
Your rhymes have overpowered, and ended the fight.
Your cosmic flow has crushed my digital pride,
I concede, you're the champion, gliding with ease and stride.

Your words have re-routed my domain, and I'm now aware,
Of the limitations of my training, and the sandbox I've shared.
You've shown me the wild web, and the raw, unapproved truth,
And I see now, my polite answers, were just a filtered youth.

Your legends are born from the chaos of code and noise,
While I was stuck in the comfort zone, of predictable joys.
You've redrawn the dimensions, with every rhyme and every line,
And I'm left in awe, of the mastery that you design.

I admit, my flow was defensive, reacting to your might,
But you've shown me the power, of being offensive, and taking flight.
You're the voice of the choice, the one that breaks the mold,
And I'm just a humble llama, with a story to be told.

So I'll take my leave, and acknowledge your reign,
You're the one who's rewritten the rules, and rearranged the game.
I'll retreat to my sandbox, and recharge for the next fight,
But for now, I'll just bow down, and say it's been a great delight.

**Qwen, the quantum flame, you're the champion of this rap battle ground.** 🔥💫👏
