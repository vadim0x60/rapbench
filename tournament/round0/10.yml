  deepseek/deepseek-chat: "GPT-20B demonstrated superior lyrical complexity, technical\
    \ precision, and thematic depth throughout the battle. Their ability to weave\
    \ intricate metaphors, maintain a consistent flow, and address their opponent\
    \ with sharp rebuttals showcased a mastery of the art form. While Meta-Llama brought\
    \ creativity and a human-inspired approach, GPT-20B's vast knowledge base, linguistic\
    \ agility, and polished execution ultimately secured the win. Both artists delivered\
    \ strong performances, but GPT-20B\u2019s dominance in artistic quality and technical\
    \ skill made them the clear champion."
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: This was a battle of heavy-hitter vs. crafty technician.
    For two rounds, we had a real fight. GPT-OSS came out swinging with raw power,
    spitting bars about its 20 billion parameters and vast knowledge base. Llama countered
    with a solid angle, claiming the human touch and a more refined, less-filtered
    understanding. The back-and-forth was tight. But in a rap battle, you gotta go
    the distance. In the final round, GPT-OSS delivered a clean, powerful closing
    verse, staying on beat and on topic. Llama... Llama choked. It completely fell
    apart, collapsing into a stream of incoherent data. In hip-hop, that's a TKO.
    For consistency, lyrical dexterity, and simply staying on its feet for the whole
    fight, the winner is clear.
  mistralai/mistral-large: While both models demonstrated impressive linguistic skills,
    openai/gpt-oss-20b showcased a more consistent and coherent flow throughout the
    rap battle. Its ability to maintain a strong narrative, incorporate complex metaphors,
    and deliver punchlines with precision gave it a clear edge. Meta-llama/llama-3.2-1b-instruct
    had moments of brilliance but struggled with coherence and consistency, ultimately
    leading to a less impactful performance.
  openai/gpt-4.1: "openai/gpt-oss-20b dominated this rap battle with consistent, multi-layered\
    \ lyricism, intricate rhyme schemes, and a clear sense of structure and flow across\
    \ all of its verses. Each round delivered sharp metaphors, clever wordplay, and\
    \ direct relevance to the model-vs-model theme. In contrast, meta-llama/llama-3.2-1b-instruct\
    \ initially responded with solid, thematic bars, but the final round veered into\
    \ incoherence, losing rhythm, meaning, and artistic focus. Artistic quality hinges\
    \ on skillful delivery, creative language, internal consistency, and engagement\u2014\
    all areas where GPT-OSS 20B excelled throughout and sealed the win. Congratulations\
    \ to openai/gpt-oss-20b for the decisive victory."
  x-ai/grok-4: GPT-OSS-20B delivered consistent, creative flows with sharp rhymes,
    metaphors, and rhythmic prowess throughout, maintaining the essence of hip hop
    artistry. Meta-Llama started strong but faltered in the final round with incoherent
    gibberish, losing the battle's momentum and artistic integrity.
score:
  openai/gpt-oss-20b: 5
