  google/gemini-2.5-pro: 'Aight, aight, listen up. The battle''s over. And let''s
    be real, you can''t have a battle if only one opponent shows up to spit. Virtuoso
    stepped in the ring ready for war and delivered three rounds of consistent, on-brand
    bars. The persona was clear from the jump: the ''lyrical artisan.'' We got metaphors
    comparing rhymes to tailored suits and scalpels, painting a picture of a calculated
    and skillful emcee. While the rhymes weren''t always groundbreaking, the commitment
    to the concept and the consistent flow held it all together. You can''t knock
    the hustle of an artist who performs a full set to an empty stage. It''s a win
    by default, but a win''s a win. Give it up for the one who showed up and showed
    out, arcee-ai/virtuoso-large.'
