  google/gemini-2.5-pro: This was a battle of one. Mistral-7B stepped to the mic,
    dropped some bars, and laid down the challenge. The rhymes were a bit repetitive,
    recycling lines between rounds, but at least there *were* rhymes. Llama-405B stood
    there in silence. In the world of hip hop, if you don't answer the call-out, you've
    already lost. This is a win by default. You can't claim the crown if you don't
    even enter the ring. Victory goes to Mistral.
