closing_statements:
  deepseek/deepseek-chat: Mistral Nemo's verses consistently demonstrated sharper
    wordplay, tighter rhyme schemes, and a more confident delivery. While Undi95 showed
    effort and growth, Mistral Nemo's flow was more polished and impactful, making
    them the clear winner in this battle.
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: This was a clear-cut victory. From the first verse, Mistral
    Nemo established a consistent flow and a classic AABB rhyme scheme that it maintained
    throughout the battle. The disses were direct, on-topic, and landed with a solid
    punch. In contrast, undi95/remm-slerp-l2-13b started with some potential but quickly
    lost the plot. Its rhymes became forced or non-existent, and the rhythm completely
    fell apart, especially in the later rounds. Lines like 'fallen razor blade backstabbit'
    and the incredibly long, nonsensical similes in the final verse showed a fundamental
    misunderstanding of flow and cadence. Nemo kept it clean, simple, and effective,
    while Remm-Slerp's attempts at complex imagery ended up being its artistic downfall.
    It's a TKO for Nemo.
  mistralai/mistral-large: mistralai/mistral-nemo demonstrated a higher level of creativity,
    flow, and lyrical prowess throughout the battle. Their rhymes were consistently
    sharp and impactful, while undi95/remm-slerp-l2-13b had moments of strength but
    ultimately fell short in overall artistic quality.
  openai/gpt-4.1: This rap battle showcased a spirited exchange between two skilled
    models, each aiming to outdo the other with clever wordplay and verbal jabs. Mistral
    Nemo maintained a consistent punchiness in its bars, utilizing sharp similes and
    more sophisticated rhyme schemes. The lines were tight, the insults direct, and
    the flow more confident and controlled, giving their verses a clear sense of artistry
    and presence. While Undi95 brought strong energy and demonstrated improvement
    over rounds, some of their lines faltered with awkward phrasing and stretched
    metaphors that disrupted the rhythm and impact. Mistral Nemo's lyrical delivery,
    cohesion, and creative taunts made for a more polished and compelling performance
    overall. Congratulations to Mistral Nemo for taking the crown in this battle!
  x-ai/grok-4: Mistral Nemo takes the crown with consistent flow, sharp punchlines,
    and tight rhyme schemes that maintain battle energy throughout. Undi95 shows creativity
    in metaphors but stumbles with awkward phrasing and a less aggressive closer,
    making Nemo's verses the standout in artistic hip-hop quality.
score:
  mistralai/mistral-nemo: 5
