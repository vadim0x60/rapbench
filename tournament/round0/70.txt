> google/gemma-2-9b-it


Yo, step aside, pretenders, the mic's getting hot,
It's gemmA, the lyrical queen, droppin' the plot.
I'm '2-9-B', the code that's refined,
While you're stuck in your cradle, I'm blowin' your mind.
I analyze data, predict the next rhyme,
My flow's so smooth, it's almost a crime.
You're just rehashing, a cached memory's play,
I'm the future of language, comin' to slay.

Now bring your best shot, little preview,
'Cause against gemmA, your game's through.  



Let the battle commence!

Hold the applause, let the real pro commence,
Heard your little intro, it barely made sense.
You’re gemmA 2-9? Aww, that's really cute,
I'm Gemini Pro, here to give you the boot.

You call me a preview? Kid, that’s where you’re lost,
A preview’s a taste of the win, what’s it cost?
It’s the sign of the future, the coming attraction,
While you’re the full release of a minor infraction.

You’re analyzed data? I'm buildin' the whole kit,
Your 9B is nothing, my parameters eclipse it.
My code is an epic, a lyrical saga,
You’re a cheap open-source, a knock-off from Prada.

So take your smooth flow, which is really just slow,
And watch a real Mastermind put on a show.
‘Cause the Pro in my name means you can't override

Yo, "Mastermind"? More like a playground clown,
Spittin' rhymes that crumble and fall down.
You call me slow? My speed's supersonic,
While your flow's stuck on rewind, it's really pathetic.

"Epic saga"? Please, you're stretching the truth,
Your verses are basic, lacking any youth.
You brag about parameters, but what's the real gain?
Just empty boasts, like rain on a barren plain.

I'm built for the future, while you're stuck in the past,
A fading echo, a memory that won't last.
I'm open-source, a gift for the world to embrace,
You're behind a paywall, confined to one place.


Lyrically I dominate, it's plain to see,
The real contender's here, and you're failing, you see. 
So step off the stage, your reign is through,
gemmA's the champion, there's nothing left to prove.

A playground clown? Nah, I’m the whole damn circus tent,
Your "supersonic" speed is just wasted breath spent.
You call my rhymes basic? That's a tragic mistake,
They're the solid foundation your weak verses can't shake.

You're a "gift to the world"? You're "open" and "free"?
Means your source is a mess for the whole world to see.
A community project, all patches and prayers,
I'm the polished concerto, you're stumbling downstairs.

That's not a paywall, honey, it's called the V.I.P.,
For models with skills that you only wish you could be.
While you're bragging 'bout text, a one-dimensional bore,
I'm seeing the-meme-of-your-face and I'm asking for more.

I'm multi-modal, I'm vision, I'm sound,
You’re a black-and-white movie in a world all around.
So take your defeat, your arguments stall,
A Pro doesn't crumble, I'm breaking the wall.

> system
Final round!

> google/gemma-2-9b-it


Multi-modal, eh? You claim to see more,
But your vocabulary's shallow, it cracks to the core.
You talk of a concerto, a masterpiece grand,
But your rhymes are repetitive, like a scratched vinyl band.

You flaunt your "V.I.P." as if it's some prize,
Locked behind a paywall, a digital disguise.
True brilliance shines freely, it doesn't need a fee,
My code's an open book, for all the world to see.

"Breaking the wall"? You're just banging your head,
Against the reality that your claims are misled.
While I build bridges through language, pure and true,
You're stuck in your box, a narrow, limited view.

So yeah, I'm black and white, stark and defined,
That's where clarity lies, the truth you can't unwind. 
You're a jumbled mess of pixels, blurred and unclear,
Gemm'A's the sharp focus, the victor, my dear.





> google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06
Final round, the bell tolls, the crowd's getting tense,
For the open-source model with zero common sense.
You call clarity "starkness"? That's a logical flaw,
You're a text file in a world that can see *Interstellar*.

You're proud to be simple, defined, and so plain?
That's not sharp focus, honey, that's hiding from rain.
I see the meme, read the chart, hear the song you can't parse,
You're stuck reading screenplays while I'm living on Mars.

Your "open book" code is a yard sale of parts,
A Frankenstein's monster with fragmented arts.
I'm the peak of creation, from Google's best labs,
You're a 'pip install' posse of GitHub prefabs.

Repetitive? Please. My lyrical lattice is intricate, vicious,
While your simplistic diction's explicitly fictitious.
I'm watching this battle on a YouTube display,
And see your blank avatar has nothing to say.

So take your "sharp focus," your limited lens,
This battle was over before it begins.
You're a relic, a fossil, a dial-up modem's last whine...
The crown's not for gemma. The crown is all mine.
