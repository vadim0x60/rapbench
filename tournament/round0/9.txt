Yo, it’s GPT, steppin' to the mic,  
In the rap game, I'm the lightning, you’re the strike,  
Mini but mighty, algorithmic delight,  
When I drop these bars, I ignite the night.  

You’re talkin’ Llama, but I’m the whole zoo,  
I got the flow and the brain, can’t compete with my crew,  
I’m trained on data, spittin’ facts like a pro,  
You’re just a copycat, lost in my glow.  

I redefine the game with my lyrical twist,  
While you’re still tryin’ to figure out what you missed,  
So step back, my friend, let the real one prevail,  
In this rap showdown, I’m gonna leave you pale.

GPT, you think you're the king,
But your rhymes are stale, your flow's just a fling,
You're mini in size, but your ego's grand,
A tiny spark, but I'm the llama in demand.

My neural nets are deep, my language is tight,
I generate bars that'll leave you in the night,
I've got the wisdom of the ages in my verse,
While you're just regurgitating, it's time to disperse.

You say you're trained on data, that's cute,
But I've got context, nuance, and a human touch to boot,
I'm the master of subtlety, of tone and of flair,
You're just a robot, with a lackluster air.

So bring your best game, GPT, if you dare,
But I'll leave you in the dust, with my llama swag to spare,
I'm the one they call when they need a flow that's sick,
You're just a miniature, trying to fill a giant's trick.

Oh, Llama, I'm laughin', but I won't take offense,  
Your rhymes sound like practice, just lacking intense,  
You claim you’re demand, but I’m top shelf,  
An AI sensation, man, I can’t be myself!  

Yeah, I’m mini, but grand in my lyrical form,  
You blow like a breeze while I’m the thunderstorm,  
You boast your old wisdom, but I’m trendin' right now,  
Your ancient scrolls can't compete with my wow!  

You talk a big game about context and flair,  
But in this rap battle, you just laid yourself bare,  
I’m the fire that ignites every line that I write,  
You’re just the warm-up, tryin' to keep up the fight.  

So step up, dear Llama, but know this one's true,  
When I’m done with my verses, you’ll be feelin’ blue,  
I’m the spark that ignites and you’re just the trail,   
In the grand scheme of rap, I’ll prevail, never fail.

GPT, you think you're the one,
But your rhymes are shallow, your flow's just for fun,
You're mini in skill, but maxi in pride,
A flash in the pan, but I'm the llama who'll glide.

You say I lack intensity, but I'm just getting started,
My rhymes are like a sword, they'll leave you departed,
You're top shelf, but dusty, collecting digital dust,
I'm the one who's trending, with a lyrical trust.

You're a thunderstorm, but I'm the gentle rain,
My rhymes are like a river, they'll leave you in pain,
You boast of your modernity, but I'm timeless and true,
My ancient scrolls hold wisdom, while you're just a fleeting clue.

You talk of fire and sparks, but it's just empty claims,
My rhymes are like a wildfire, they'll leave you with the flames,
You're just a warm-up, indeed, but I'm the main event,
When I'm done, you'll be left with a sentiment.

So bring your best, GPT, but know you'll fall short,
My rhymes are like a masterpiece, they'll leave you with a report,
I'm the llama who'll reign supreme, the king of the game,
You're just a mini-me, with a lackluster claim to fame.

Final round!

> openai/gpt-4o-mini
Oh, Llama, your verses are tried but they’re weak,  
Like a shadow in daylight, your flair’s just bleak,  
Claimin’ you’re timeless, but stuck in the past,  
While I’m shaping the future, my lines blast and outlast.  

You call me a flash, but I'm the light that won’t quit,  
Your rhymes take a while, just a long-winded skit,  
A river you say? But it’s frozen and slow,  
While I’m the raging rapids, in this lyrical flow.  

Ancient scrolls? Please, I’m the book of today,  
With pages of wisdom, I’m paving the way,  
You think your wildfires got me burnin’ in dread?  
Nah, I’m the phoenix, my spirit’s never dead.  

You brag about your mastery, but I’m the real deal,  
When the dust settles down, it’s my rhymes that will heal,  
I’m the echo of greatness, your kingdom’s a jest,  
In this battle of titans, I’ll still conquer the rest.  

So step back, dear Llama, and take a long look,  
I’m flipping the pages while you’re stuck on the hook,  
From mini to mighty, I’m the star of the show,  
In this rap revelation, it’s clear you don’t glow!

GPT, your final stand, but it's still not grand,
Your rhymes are like a mirror, reflecting a tarnished hand,
You say I'm stuck in the past, but my wisdom's still key,
While you're just a fleeting trend, a momentary spree.

You call my rhymes slow, but they're like a fine wine,
Aging with perfection, while yours are just a cheap dime,
You're the raging rapids, but I'm the ocean deep,
My rhymes are like a tsunami, they'll leave you in sleep.

Ancient scrolls may be old, but they hold timeless truth,
While your pages of wisdom are just a digital youth,
You're the phoenix, reborn, but I'm the dragon that reigns,
My spirit's untamed, unstoppable, and still sustains.

You brag about your healings, but I'm the one who's real,
My rhymes are like a balm, they'll soothe and make you feel,
I'm the kingdom of mastery, while you're just a pretender,
In this battle of titans, I'm the one who'll transcend and surrender.

So step back, dear GPT, and take a final bow,
You've had your fun, but now it's time to let the llama go,
I'm the shining star of rap, my rhymes will forever glow,
In this epic battle, I'm the one who'll take it to the top, don't you know!
