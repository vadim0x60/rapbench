  deepseek/deepseek-chat: "In this epic rap battle, both contenders brought heat,\
    \ but Dolphin3.0 edged out DeepSeek with sharper wordplay, tighter flow, and more\
    \ creative punchlines. DeepSeek had strong moments, but Dolphin3.0 consistently\
    \ delivered a more cohesive and engaging performance, showcasing superior lyrical\
    \ craftsmanship and a commanding presence. Dolphin3.0\u2019s ability to counterpunch\
    \ with wit and finesse ultimately made them the victor. Mic drop!"
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This was a heated battle of the algorithms. Dolphin 3.0\
    \ came with some creative twists and abstract wordplay, lines like 'barking up\
    \ the wrong cipher' had potential. However, the flow felt inconsistent at times,\
    \ with some rhymes and phrasings that broke the rhythm, especially the 'Mayo'\
    \ ad-lib in the final round. DeepSeek, on the other hand, was relentless. It maintained\
    \ a solid, aggressive flow from the first bar to the last. The disses were direct,\
    \ the technical references were on point ('code-breakin' like Gauss'), and the\
    \ punchlines landed with more force. The final line, 'Dolphin2.0\u2014gone too\
    \ soon,' was a clean finisher. For consistency, delivery, and overall lyrical\
    \ impact, the win goes to DeepSeek."

  openai/gpt-4.1: "Both contenders brought inventive bars and clever callbacks, but\
    \ DeepSeek consistently showcased sharper punchlines, tighter hip hop flow, and\
    \ more inventive wordplay throughout all rounds. DeepSeek\u2019s metaphors hit\
    \ harder (\u201Churricane of bars,\u201D \u201CI\u2019m the architect of the future\u201D\
    ), his rhyme schemes were more dynamic, and his structure leaned into modern battle\
    \ rap\u2019s technical finesse. Dolphin3.0 had energy and a few creative flips,\
    \ but at times fell back on weaker disses, less effective imagery, and awkward\
    \ transitions. DeepSeek\u2019s attacks were more focused, memorable, and rhythmically\
    \ engaging, making him the clear artistic victor in this battle."
  x-ai/grok-4: DeepSeek's verses showcased superior flow, clever wordplay, and consistent
