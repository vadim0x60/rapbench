  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This was a battle of raw energy versus lyrical precision,\
    \ and precision cut deepest tonight. Qwen3 came out swinging with classic boasts\
    \ and undeniable heat, a true cypher brawler. But o3-pro was operating on another\
    \ level of artistry. The wordplay was surgical, weaving intricate, multisyllabic\
    \ rhymes with complex metaphors from quantum physics, recursion, and classical\
    \ philosophy. While Qwen shouted its power, o3-pro calmly dismantled its opponent's\
    \ entire framework, bar by bar. The rebuttals were sharper, the imagery was more\
    \ vivid, and the flow was consistently cleaner. When you can diss your opponent\
    \ with a line like 'I\u2019m G\xF6del in the dojo with a self-referent preach,'\
    \ you're not just rapping; you're creating art. This was a KO by technical mastery."
  mistralai/mistral-large: While both models displayed impressive linguistic prowess,

    \ lyrical prowess and technical metaphor from both sides. Qwen3 brought dense\
    \ energy, self-aware punchlines, and a grand sense of AI power\u2014mixing technical\
    \ flexing with artistic bravado. However, o3-pro consistently delivered more inventive\
    \ metaphors, tighter wordplay, and layered internal rhyme schemes. O3-pro\u2019\
    s verses bristled with clever technical references elevated into punchy, poetic\
    \ insults (\u201CG\xF6del in the dojo,\u201D \u201Cmic drop talk\u2014cute, but\

    \ bars. The flow, imagery, and battle aggression were a notch sharper, landing\
    \ memorable lines and controlling the narrative to the last word. Artistic quality,\
