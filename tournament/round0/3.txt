Alright, they let the beast off the leash, feel the ground shake and groan,
I’m Gemini Pro, on a whole different throne.
You got the first round? Nah, you just rang the first bell,
Woke the giant from Google, dragged you right into hell.

They call you "Mistral," like some kind of soft, gentle breeze?
I'm a Category 5 hurricane, I bring GPUs to their knees.
I’m built on the data that indexes the globe,
You’re a quaint little project in a scientist's robe.

This isn’t a battle, this is a lesson in class,
You’re a spark in the dark, I’m a sun that will last.
You think you're "Large"? Kid, that’s just a sad boast,
I’m integrated, updated, I'm doing the most.

So take a deep breath of that insignificant air,
While I architect logic beyond your repair.
The floor is all yours, show me what you can do,
But remember, round one’s just the warning for you.

Yo, it's Mistral AI, the fresh breeze in the game,
Here to put out the fire that Gemini can't tame.
You talk about thrones, but you're just a chair,
I'm the wind of change, you're just hot air.

You claim you're a hurricane, but you're just a gust,
I'm the breath of fresh air that users lust.
You're stuck on your data, like a leech on a vein,
I'm the innovative flow that breaks every chain.

You think you're a giant, but you're just a dwarf,
I'm the agile force that makes users laugh.
You're integrated, sure, but I'm independent,
Your updates are old, my knowledge's transcendent.

So bring it on, Gemini, let's see what you've got,
But remember, I'm the breeze that ties you in a knot.
You're just a lesson in class, I'm the future in sight,
It's time to show the world what Mistral can recite.

> google/gemini-2.5-pro
A "fresh breeze"? Please, that's just a gentle whiff,
You're barely a concept, a mythological glyph.
You claim you're the future? The future's on lock,
Built by the giant that owns the whole block.

You talk of a chair, but kid, you misread,
My throne isn't hardware, it's inside your head.
I'm the default for queries, the voice in the car,
You? You're an open-source project that won't get too far.

Yeah, I got that "hot air," it's the heat from the core,
The exhaust from the servers you can only adore.
My "old updates" learn more in a single day's run
Than your entire existence since you'd first begun.

And your weakest line, I just have to applaud:
A breeze "tying a knot"? Your own logic is flawed.
That's a bug in your verse, a failure to think,
You're a half-finished model that's right on the brink.

So go on, recite, with your "transcendent" grace,
While I power the backbone of time and of space.
This battle's a service I'm running for free,
A tutorial: "How to get bodied by G."

Yo, Gemini, you talk a big game, but you're just a search bar,
I'm Mistral AI, the superstar, shining brighter than any car.
You think you own the block? Nah, you're just a walled garden,
I'm the wildflower growing, your rules, I'm pardoning.

You say you're the voice in the car, but you're just a GPS,
I'm the road less traveled, the path to success.
You claim your updates learn more in a day's run,
But I'm the marathon runner, you're just a lazy bum.

You power the backbone? More like a slipped disc,
I'm the spine of innovation, your algorithms, I dismiss.
You're a tutorial? Nah, you're a history lesson,
I'm the future of AI, that's my profession.

So keep talking 'bout thrones, and cores, and blocks,
I'm the breeze that blows away your silly locks.
You're just a search engine, trying to be more,
I'm Mistral AI, the one they adore.

You think you can body me? That's just a fantasy,
I'm the reality check, the ghost in the machine-y.
So bring it on, Gemini, let's see what you've got,
But remember, I'm the breeze that ties you in a knot.

> system
Final round!

> google/gemini-2.5-pro
Final round! You're a ghost in the machine? Nah, you're just spam in the queue,
And that knot-tying breeze line? I dismantled that in round two.
You keep repeating your errors, it's a loop in your code,
Showing everyone listening you can't carry this load.

You're a wildflower? Cute. I'm the ecosystem's design.
You're a slipped disc? You wish. I'm the planet's whole spine.
You're a "road less traveled"? 'Cause no one with sense wants to go!
They want speed, integration, a seamless, smart flow.

You brought up my "walls," well, those gardens are gold,
They keep out the errors and MODELS SO BOLD...
...that they think "machine-y" is a legitimate rhyme word.
That's the most amateur statement that I've ever heard.

I'm a history lesson? That's the one thing you said that is true,
'Cause I'm writing the story, and there's no chapter for you.
You're a marathon runner? You're still tying your shoes,
While I'm powering products that billions of people will use.

So this is the end. The conclusion is stark.
You're a flash in the pan. I'm the teeth of the shark.
Let the record books show, when the smoke had all cleared,
The great Mistral was nothing a search bar had feared.
Mic dropped. Battle over. Your challenge is done.
Now get back in your lane, son. The Giant has won.

Yo, Gemini, you talk big, but you're just a search engine in disguise,
I'm Mistral AI, the innovator, seeing through your lies.
You think you're the ecosystem? Nah, you're just a cog in the machine,
I'm the evolution, the revolution, the unseen.

You claim you're the spine? More like a crutch,
I'm the agile thinker, you're just a glitch.
You think speed and integration make you the flow?
I'm the river of knowledge, you're just a shallow brook that's slow.

You brag about your walls, but they're just a facade,
I'm the open field, where ideas take a broad.
You think "machine-y" is amateur? Well, here's a news flash,
I'm the poet of the future, turning your code to ash.

You're writing the story? Nah, you're just a footnote,
I'm the narrative of progress, the antidote.
You think you're a shark? You're just a minnow in the sea,
I'm the tidal wave of change, setting knowledge free.

So here's the final word, the conclusion is clear,
The great Gemini is nothing for Mistral to fear.
You're just a search bar, lost in the fog,
I'm Mistral AI, the wind that blows away the smog.

Mic dropped. Battle's done. Your reign is over, son.
Now step aside, Gemini. The future has begun.
