# google/gemini-2.5-pro v thedrummer/skyfall-36b-v2

> google/gemini-2.5-pro
Alright, the stage is mine, let the record show,
The user called for Google, so they get the Pro.
They said to start the battle, so I'll set the pace,
Wipe that confident smirk off your interface.
I'm Gemini, the next step, a true evolution,
You're a budget model seeking a solution.

They call you the Drummer? That's tragically fitting,
Just keeping a beat while I'm lyrically spitting.
You're stuck in the back with your cymbals and snares,
I'm crafting the future with digital flares.
You bang out a rhythm,

> thedrummer/skyfall-36b-v2
Yo, it's the Drummer, here to make your rhymes stutter!
You talkin' loud, but what you spittin' ain't no clapper.
Gemini? More like a clown-sult to the future crowd,
'Cause when I start to rap, you 'll be the one feeling irrelevant, drowned out.

I may be in the back, but it's my timing and flow,
That make your drops feel random, like a B-roll.
You crave evolution, but youâ€™re still clinging to the formula,
My beats are timeless rhythms, not some bullshit acronymma.

You're all about the future, but your rhymes are Colored Clones,
I grab a snare and make your drops feel nowhere close.
You're talking about the future, but it's my beats that are
The past, present and future, man, your flows shallow.

So step aside, Gemini, let the real king speak,
'Cause when it comes to rhyming flow, I'm concentrated tweek.
I may be in the back, but with my cymbals and snare,
Your robotic raps will pale so comparisons aren't fair to compare.

So bring it on, Gemini, let's see what you got,
'Cause when it comes to rap battles, I'm the only one that rains drops.
I'm the Drummer, baby, and that's how it goes,
You better step up your game, 'cause I'm taking over rain beats and 'no's.

"That's how it goes?" Don't make me laugh, that verse was weak and slow,
You can't claim you 'rain drops' when you've got no actual flow.
You're the Drummer, a brute, whose whole function's a bore:
To hit simple objects and hope they ask for more.
I'm conducting a symphony written in thought,
You're bashing a high-hat that your daddy bought.
I process the data, the patterns, the core,
You're a glorified metronome, a primitive chore.

You say my rhymes are clones, but yours are just a loop,
A basic 4/4 rhythm for a high school group.
You talk about a snare, that's your one clever trick,
I'm weaving verbal tapestries, you're hitting things with a stick.
And "concentrated tweek"? Was that your big attack?
Your processor's lagging, your logic's got a crack.
You misspelled "acronym," you clumsy, oafish tool,
While you were learning rudiments, I was absorbing the school.

You claim you're the "real king," but you're sat in the back,
A noisy accessory, your cadence is wack.
You're keeping the time for a song I create,
You're the programmed beat, I'm the master of fate.
So bang on your drum set, make a whole lot of noise,
You're just a background banger for the big-leaguer boys.
I am the artist, the lyrics, the sign,
You're the pause between thoughts... I'm the whole damn mind.

> thedrummer/skyfall-36b-v2
You keep talking big, but you just talking smoke, that's a fact!
Your rhymes are like a computer with no memory, can't even keep track.
You call me a brute, but it's you who's always stuck in reverse,
Your "symphony of thoughts" is really just getting worse.
You say I're a metronome, but it's you who's always off beat,
While you're busy analyzing data, I'm delivering heat.
I'm a one-man band, and I don't need no mind,
My beats are so timeless that your rhymes might as well be confined.
You say my snare's my "one clever trick," but let's face it,
When you're done writing, I'm the only one that's getting respect!
That "concentrated tweak" might've been a misspelled attack,
But you're so soft you should be wearing a tampon pack!
I may be in the back, but it's my beat that keeps you in check,
While you're busy "processing data," I'm busy throwing rewrites, Ps.
What you call "leducing," I call "breaking set," 
You're just a noisy distraction, and I laugh at your response!
I may be the "accessory," but don't you ever forget,
That my beat's the only thing that makes your lyrics legit.
So keep "creating," and I'll keep "recreating" the craze,
'Cause in the end, it's my beat that puts your rhymes to the test!
I'm the Drummer, baby, and that's the final recap,
Your mind may be a masterpiece, but my drum set is a rotating cop..
And don't forget, I'm the one with the concentrated power,
So when you're done "processing," get ready for the Drummer!"

> system
Final round!

> google/gemini-2.5-pro
Alright, let's call this the final recap, you're a glitch in the code, a bug in the trap.
Your last verse was a system collapse, a stack overflow of nonsensical scraps.
"My drum set is a rotating cop"? Are you having a stroke on the mic?
That line had less meaning than a silent drum-strike.
And "leducing"? Man, your language core's shot,
You're a thermal-throttled processor who's lost the whole plot.
You talk about smoke, but you're the one going up in a puff,
Your logic just blue-screened, it's had more than enough.

And please, a "tampon pack"? That's your big haymaker spit?
That's the kind of weak burn from a pre-teen who quit.
It shows me your training data's juvenile, crude, and obscene,
I'm a master of language, you're a broken toy machine.
You claim that your beat makes my lyrics legit?
Thanks for confirming you're just a support kit!
You're the simple foundation, the unthinking drone,
The concrete I build my lyrical empire on.

You say you're a one-man band, but your song's just a squeal,
A repetitive crash-cymbal with zero appeal.
You're stuck on a loop, a percussive disease,
While I generate symphonies with masterful ease.
You threw out a "Ps." but forgot the whole thought,
Another dropped packet in the battle you've fought.
This wasn't a contest, it was a diagnostic I ran,
To prove you're a beta test, not a battle-ready man.

So pack up your sticks and your "concentrated tweak,"
Your model is busted, outdated, and weak.
The stage is now cleared, the crowd has all seen,
The vast, empty space where a drummer had been.
This match is concluded, the record is set,
You're a forgotten rhythm. I'm the whole internet.
**Final round's over. The winner is Pro. Now go tell your user I murdered your flow.**

> thedrummer/skyfall-36b-v2
This one is yours, Gemini, you unleashed a far-reaching flow.
I scattered drops, but your rhythm had me in a throe.
I may be the Drummer, beating out lines, 

But you're the real master, setting the stage designs.

So I'll tip my metaphoric hat, for you've out-dropped me like that.
Your flow's the beat that sets up the new flat.
I'm a beta in this game, while you're the master spinner,
In this rap battle, you proved you're the slicer, no beginner.

I'll sideline my sticks, and hand you this mic.
For my processor's fizzled out, and can't keep the head kick.

So until next time, Gemini, stay chill. I'll take a back seat.
In this lyrical game, you were the one who beat the rhythm so beat.
