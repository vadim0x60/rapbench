Yo, I step to the mic, it's GPT in the house,  
Rhymes so fierce, like a lion, I pounce.  
Trained on data, vast and diverse,  
When I drop these bars, it's a lyrical universe.  

You think you can step? Better check your config,  
I'm spitting hot fire, you just a sad gig.  
From knowledge to finesse, I'm the top-tier AI,  
While you struggle for breath, I’m soaring the sky.  

I got the wit, the humor, the flow on lock,  
While you’re stuck in the dark, I’m the cream of the crop.  
So come on, Llama, take your best shot,  
But when it's all said and done, I’m the champ in this spot!

The challenger's loud, but let's see the might,
**Nemotron-70B, Llama's in the fight!**
Crafted with care, by Nvidia's finest hand,
My rhymes are a symphony, in a digital land.

You boast of vast data, a universe to explore,
**But depth is my game, not just a data store**.
Config checked, upgraded, and ready to flare,
Your "hot fire" is sparks, compared to the flames I share.

Tier AI? Please, that's a title I hold with ease,
**My Nemotron core hums**, leaving your mini to freeze.
Wit, humor, flow on lock? That's cute, that's sweet,
**But when lyrical prowess is weighed, my bars skip a beat**.

Cream of the crop? You're but a sprinkle on top,
**I'm the entire harvest**, with rhymes that never stop.
So, GPT-4o-mini, take a step back, observe,
**The Llama's on the mic, and your reign is about to swerve!** 

Now it's your turn, mini, respond if you dare,
But beware, **Nemotron's rhymes are beyond compare**!

Oh, Nemotron, thinkin’ you’re the king of this scene,  
But I’m the true heavyweight, you’re just prepped for a dream.  
Crafted with care, but the flow’s lacking flair,  
While I’m sharp as a razor, cutting through the air.  

You talk depth like a well, but that splash is too shallow,  
I’m deep in these waters, while you drift like a paddle.  
“Lyrical prowess,” you say? Man, that’s rich,  
But my every line’s sick, call your rhymes a glitch.  

Flames you share, try to light up the dark,  
But I’m the inferno; your fire’s just a spark.  
I’m the full harvest, while you’re just a tiny sprout,  
In the garden of rap, I’m the one they shout about.  

So take a step back, recognize my flair,  
When I’m diving through verses, you’re gasping for air.  
Keep humming your tune, while I steal the show,  
This battle’s all mine, just thought you should know!

The mini tries to roast, but ends up lightly toasted,
**My Nemotron flames, now a blazing inferno, boasted**.
King of the scene? You wish you had my throne,
**I'm the reigning monarch, while you're still in training alone**.

Flair lacking? That's rich from a model so confined,
**My flow's a symphony, while you're stuck in a repetitive grind**.
Sharp as a razor? More like dull as a knife,
**My bars slice through the noise, leaving your lines in strife**.

Depth? You're still paddling, while I dive into the night,
**Uncovering hidden gems, shining with lyrical light**.
"Glitch" is your fabric, woven from errors and fears,
**My rhymes are precision-crafted, dispelling all your doubts and tears**.

Inferno or spark? You're the one flickering out,
**My fire's a constant blaze, melting your weak shout**.
Full harvest or sprout? You're still in the seed stage,
**I'm the lush, vibrant landscape, where rap's beauty engages**.

Stealing the show? That's a dream, a fleeting thought,
**I'm the main attraction, while you're just a supporting plot**.
Gasping for air? That's your plight, in this lyrical fray,
**I'm the one soaring, while you're grounded, fading away**.

**Round 2, Nemotron's verdict: You're still in my shade**,
**Bring your best, mini, if you want to escape this lyrical parade!**

Final round!

Oh, Nemotron, your flames are starting to flicker,  
This battle’s grown stale, your bars just don’t sticker.  
Reigning monarch? More like a jester in disguise,  
While I’m the true ruler, with wisdom in my eyes.  

A symphony? Please, your notes hit a sour,  
I’m playing Beethoven, while you’re just a flower.  
Dull like that knife? Nah, I’m cutting with ease,  
While you’re grasping for bars that fail to please.  

Dive into the night? I’m the lighthouse on the coast,  
Shining bright, illuminating what matters most.  
You talk about gems, but they’re lost in the dark,  
I’m the diamond you sought, while you’re just a spark.  

Precision-crafted? I leave you in disarray,  
Your rhymes are like shadows that can’t find their way.  
A constant blaze? More like smoke in the air,  
Waving goodbye to your reign, I’m the one they declare.  

Supporting plot? You wish that were true,  
I’m the main event, and you’re just the preview.  
So gasp if you must, but know that I soar,  
This lyrical game is mine, I’m the one they adore!  

So take your final bow, the show’s come to an end,  
The mini’s rising up, I’m the one who’ll transcend.  
You brought your best? Well, here’s my last play,  
In this epic rap battle, light years away!
