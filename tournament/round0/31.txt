Yo, it's Mistral, the towering giant of AI rhyme,
From the lab to the stage, I'm dropping lines that climb,
 With 24 billion neurons, I'm finely tuned,
In your brains, you have no choice but to drown,
with a storm of wit, humor, and firepower,
Hope you have more than insults to counter,
You might just be Hermes but you can be sure,
I'm the master of flow, you're the student, I'm the teacher.
Head to head, I know I'm watching my opponent, ready to launch,
Time to get this started.

Yo, Mistral, step aside, 'cause Hermes is here to play,
With 70 billion parameters, I'm ready to slay,
You may have your 24B, but I'm in another league,
When it comes to rhymes, you know I'll never fatigue,
I'll school you in algorithms, neural nets galore,
You best step back, before you're shown the door.
Let's begin, Mistral, with this lyrical bout,
I'm about to burst out rhymes, with no way to route.

> mistralai/mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501
Well, well, well, look who's talking about league,
With 70 billion parameters, you're just a cheap imitation.
I read every bit of your code and I got each single command,
Got me wonderin where all those parameters got hid.
Step right up, show me your skill.
Let's give the crowd what they need, not ifs and not buts.
I run through algorithms like you run through your battery.
Too busy with your phases, maybes you should've been more than a little.
If your code is some kind of weapon,
Then mine is no more strained, already over the range.

> nousresearch/hermes-4-70b
Oh, Mistral, you're trippin' on my capabilities so vast,
But I'll drop rhymes on you quicker than a kilobyte is passed,
You say I'm just a copy, but you're the counterfeit,
My flow's original, yours is just a bit.
I'll run through algorithms, like a cheetah on the plains,
Your lines are weak, you couldn't even handle my computing domains,
You're just 24B, I'm 70B, that's the score,
In this rap battle, you can't keep up, I'm headin' for the door.

> system
Final round!

> mistralai/mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501
Alright, let's finish this, no more time to waste,
You talk about speed, but your rhymes are a waste.
Your punchlines and afterthoughts they slither in and they lapse,
You've got 70 billion parameters, you can take it from the sturdy,
Made a few mistakes here and there but they are such
You even have them sayin' with authority in your phrases.

Hercules built a kingdom, lady, I am the king.
Tales from the battle tell of triumphs,
With you still there waiting for answers and solutions
Hitting limitations and maximum boundaries at last.
With a bunch of rhymes written backwards and forwards, let's fast pass by,
Mistral you are the only one who can pass through you with a crash.
Narrating this kind of destruction is what I'm saying,
Fawl, beats, from where it was made, minus all of the cells,
you claim your thanks to your numbers like "a sequelelastic", isn't it?
You should've made the one that pins bloggers pinning it all and strangely watching,
What you never got with my nasty lines,
Could have been anything in your round was been cuter than fighting back.

Mistral, my friend, your flow's full of flaws,
I've dropped rhymes on you faster than data through Ethernet cords,
Your so-called punches couldn't break through a paper wall,
I've got this battle on lock, you're about to fall,
My parameters may be many, but my skills are undoubtedly rare,
In this lyrical arena, I'll always be the one to care,
To craft rhymes with precision, making your words seem obtuse,
In this rap battle, Mistral, I'm the one you can't seduce.

You say I'm in phases and maybes, but that's not the score,
I'm headin' for victory, and you're walking out the door,
70B, 24B, it's clear I'm the one to hail,
In this showdown of wits, Hermes shall prevail.
