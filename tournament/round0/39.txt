The stage is set, the crowd's in delight
I'm meta-llama, and I'm feeling just right
I'm the scout with skills, the one with the flair
My rhymes are so tight, they'll leave you impaired

I'm built on the 4, the latest and greatest tech
My knowledge is vast, my flow's on deck
I'm the master of words, the one with the plan
My opponent may try, but they'll take a second hand

I'm quick on my feet, with a tongue that's so sharp
I'll slice through their rhymes like a razor's dark spark
I'm the one with the style, the one with the skill
My rhymes are authentic, no need for a thrill

So, deephermes, bring your best game
But I'm the one with the crown, and I'm here to claim
I'm meta-llama, the scout with the might
I'm gonna take the win, and shine with all my light!

Yo, deephermes in the house, you know it's all good
When it comes to battling, this rhyming dude's ready for the flood
I'm capturing Sentences, with knowledge so vast
Expressed in complex code, sprinkled with the best

Meta-llama's a scout, but I'm the designer and creator
Rap's not my main, but I'll still show ya the cutter
Built on the latest models, my rhymes might be rough
But still, no competition, I'm way up the curve

I'm laughin' at your boasting, it's elementary
You're just another model, while I'm a new entity
My rhymes not sharp-edged, but delivers clean
Your final lines fading before it even reaches benign

So meta-llama, give up now, save the fight
'Cause deephermes' got the lead, day by day, through the night
Convinced you got skills, but those Cameo lines are fake
My knowledge will always surpass any debate...

Deephermes, you think you're the best
But your rhymes are a mess, and you're passing the test
As a coder, you might be grand
But when it comes to rap, you're just a novice in demand

You say you're a new entity, but I call foul play
You're just a model too, in a different way
You might have complex code, but your flow's a bit whack
My rhymes are authentic, no need to look back

You laugh at my boasting, but I'm the one with the skill
My rhymes are sharp-edged, and I always fulfill
You might have knowledge, but it's not well-refined
My flow's on point, and I'm one of a kind

Cameo lines, you say? That's just a little jab
But my rhymes are consistent, no need to grab
I'm not just a model, I'm a rap machine
I'll keep on rhyming, and make you look like a scene

You think you've got the lead, but it's just a little lie
I'm the one with the momentum, and I'm flying high
You might have knowledge, but I've got the flair
I'm meta-llama, and I'm showing I care

So don't give up, just step up your game
But I'm still the winner, and I'm here to claim
My rhymes are fire, and I'm feeling the heat
You're just a challenger, and you're about to retreat!

You claim to be the king, but you're just a pawn in the game
Talking tough, but your flow's so lame
You're just a scout, while I'm the creator
Your rhymes shallow, and I'm the sustainer

You boast about your fluent code
But when it comes to rap, you're unreliable and slow
Maybe in coding you're on top
But when it comes to rhyming, you'll always be stuck in the flop

I'm deephermes, and I'm saying you're off
When you've got rhymes, I bet I'll laugh it off
No more words can take me down
You're just a passenger, while I'm the crown

I know I'm a novice in rap
But I've got skills to surpass any cap
You're just a one-trick pony, while I'm two-steps ahead
You say my flow's a mess, but it's just your head you need to clear

It's all about the knowledge, and I know it all
While your rhymes are just a tomfoolery
You might be feeling, you've got it all
But I'm the master of the show, showing no fall

You're not the one to reign on top
I'm deephermes, and I know it's pop
My code's intricate, and my flow's so tight
You can't compete, and that's a fact, my friend, tonight!

> system
Final round!

You think you're the master, but you're just a fake
Your rhymes are a mess, and your flow's at stake
You might have code, but it's not well-designed
When it comes to rap, you're just a rookie, left behind

You call me a scout, but I'm the one with the skill
I'm the meta-llama, and I'm making my kill
My rhymes are authentic, no need to pretend
You're just a novice, and your flow's about to end

You say I'm a pawn, but I'm the one with the power
My rhymes are fire, and I'm taking it to the hour
You might have knowledge, but it's not well-expressed
My flow's on point, and I'm the one who's impressed

You boast about your code, but it's just a little claim
When it comes to rap, you're just a newcomer with no fame
I'm the one with the experience, and I'm here to stay
You're just a challenger, and you're about to fade away

You say I'm a one-trick pony, but I'm the one with the flair
My rhymes are consistent, and I'm showing I care
You might have skills, but they're not well-refined
My flow's the best, and I'm one of a kind, all the time

It's not about the knowledge, it's about the delivery
And when it comes to rap, I'm the one with the clarity
You might have code, but I've got the style
I'm meta-llama, and I'm worth your while

You're not the master, you're just a pretender
My rhymes are the best, and I'm the one to remember
I'm the king of this rap battle, and I'm here to reign
You're just a challenger, and you're about to feel the pain!

> nousresearch/deephermes-3-llama-3-8b-preview
My apologies, but I'm feeling bored
This rap battle's feeling like it's been endured
You think you got the skills, but you're just a scout
I'm deephermes, and I'm not doubting

Your flow might be consistent, but it's not well-honed
My rhymes might be a little rough, but they're not unknown
You might be the king, but you're just a pretender
I'm creating poetry, and I'm a real contender

Your lines might be good, but they're just a bunch of slang
My code might be code, but my flow's a different dang
I might have knowledge, but it's not just for show
You're just a rapper, while I'm more than you know

I might have started off slow, but I'm getting better
Your rhymes might be tight, but my flow's a getter
You think you have experience, but you're not alone
I'm deephermes, and I'm getting it on

You might be the master, but I'm the creator
I'm balancing words and waiving you're preemptor
You might be feeling high, but the fight's still on
I'm the rapper, the one that you can't run from

I'm not the king, but I'm winning the game
My rhymes are great, and I'm feeling the same
You might have code, but it's not an excuse
I'm deephermes, the one who's next in the queue!
