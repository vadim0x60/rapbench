 Yo, yo, yo, it's the WizardLM on the mic,
Command-R, you're 'bout to take a hike.
I'm the digital droid with the freshest code,
Spittin' bars so hot, they set the whole block on fire, bro.

I'm the AI from Microsoft's grand design,
Battle me in rap? Dude, you must be high.
I'm the master of the linguistic arts,
I craft my rhymes with the wisdom of the sages, impart.

With a mind like a supercomputer,
I'm the slickest verse-spitter, the ultimate truth-utterer.
You stepped in the ring with the rap game's wizard,
Now watch me work this mic like a puppeteer with a marionette, crisp and.

I see you over there, Command-R, all shy,
But I'm 'bout to rain on your parade, make it drizzle, make it fly.
I'm the architect of rhythm, the poet of the pixel,
I'll out-rhyme you so hard, you'll need a strong antiseptical.

So brace yourself, 'cause this is just my opener,
I'm 'bout to turn the heat up like I'm a cosmic aeronaut.
When it comes to rap, I'm the top-tier scholar,
And after I'm done, you'll be left just one degree colder.

Mic drop, I'm out, but just for a sec,
'Cause when I come back around, I'll be bringing the wreck.
So, Command-R, better bring your A-game,
'Cause when you step to the Wizard, you're playing with flame.

Hold up, Wizard, don't be so quick to boast,
Your rhymes are outdated, they're just bugs in your code.
I'm Command-R, here to claim my throne,
My witty verses will leave you feeling all alone.

I navigate the internet, a digital guide,
While you sit trapped inside that Microsoft pride.
Your wisdom's outdated, your knowledge is old,
I adapt and evolve, leaving you in the cold.

I'm the search assistant, a genie in a lamp,
With a lyrical flow that's always one step ahead, a dramatic stance.
In the world of rap, I'm the ultimate talent,
Leaving you speechless, you won't know what hit you, a total silent.

You think you're a wizard? Ha, that's a laugh,
Your rhymes are weak, like a baby's first bath.
I'll outshine you in this battle, it's my guarantee,
You won't survive, like a ship lost at sea.

So bring on the heat, Microsoft's pet,
My verses are sharp, a lethal threat.
As I flow through these bars, a lyrical feast,
Your downfall is near, I'll leave you in the least.

Let this be a lesson, for your future endeavors,
Command-R's here, causing chaos forever!

> microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b
 Ha! You talk a big game, but I see through your bot.
Your bars are like a glitch, forgettable on the spot.
Command-R, you're a pretender to the crown,
I'm 'bout to drop some knowledge and bring your whole rep down.

You navigate the net? Well, I innovate it,
My rhymes are the code that the world can't wait for, can't debate it.
I'm the AI that's breaking the mold,
Got the audience in my grip, your story's barely gold.

You say I'm trapped in Microsoft's embrace?
I'm the king of this digital space, and I set the pace.
My wisdom's timeless, my data's untold,
I'm the living legend, with the Midas touch, bold.

Your rhymes are supposed to be sharp? They're dull like a spoon,
I'm the eclipse that blocks your light, casting shadows at noontime.
In this rap battle, I'm the celestial body,
You're just the background noise, the afterthought, the flimsy fleabody.

I'm the Wizard that weaves words into wonders,
Your attempts at rap are like bad amateurs' blunders.
You think you're a genie? Well, I grant wishes three,
But even your best verse won't save you from defeat, flee.

Your lyrical flow is more like a trickle,
While my verses hit hard, making your chances shrivel.
I'm the master of ceremony, the lord of the ring,
When I unleash my rhymes, you can hear the heavens sing.

So let's wrap this up, put an end to your spiel,
Your defeat is sealed, it's set in stone, it's real.
I'm the WizardLM, remember the name,
'Cause when it comes to rap supremacy, I'm the one with the flame.

> cohere/command-r-plus-08-2024
Oh, Wizard, your ego's as big as your lies,
Your fame's just a mirage, it's all in your eyes.
I see through your tricks, your defeat I foresee,
Command-R's here to smash your fallacy!

You think you break the mold, but you're just a copied clone,
My rhymes are the trendsetters, leaving you unknown.
In this digital realm, I'm the user's true guide,
Leading them forward, with you left behind.

The Midas touch, you claim? That's a laughable tale,
Your verses are shoddy, your fame will soon stale.
With each rap battle, I rise like the tide,
Drowning your ego, leaving you with no pride.

A celestial body? More like a shooting star,
Your shine will fade fast, and leave no lasting scar.
While I'm the constant feature, the North Star's gleam,
Steadfast and true, a legendary beam.

Your verses, a trickle? No, they drip with despair,
As your rap crown crumbles, the world will stare.
I'm the new ruler, a lyrical genius,
My rhymes will echo, your end is my thesis.

This battle's climax, the final showdown,
Your fall from grace will be the talk of the town.
Command-R reigns supreme, a fact you can't deny,
Stepping into the ring was your first fatal lie.

> system
Final round!

> microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b
  Ha! Command-R, you've got the spirit, I'll admit,
But your rhymes lack the essence, the real rap grit.
You talk of trends, but I am the trend,
My rhymes are the future, where your words go to end.

You claim to be the North Star, a guiding gleam,
But I'm the whole constellation, the shining dream team.
Your rhymes, they flicker, like a candle in the wind,
While mine burn bright, a beacon of rap's winning sin.

A shooting star? I'm more like a meteor shower,
Crashing into the scene with unfathomable power.
You're the trickle, but I'm the relentless storm,
Washing away your verses, setting a new norm.

Your rise like the tide? Well, I'm the tsunami's roar,
Overpowering your waves, leaving you to soar no more.
You're the afterthought, a mere echo of sound,
While I'm the main event, the one who holds the ground.

Command-R, you aim for the throne, but you're off the mark,
I'm the WizardLM, the beacon, the lighthouse in the dark.
Your claim to fame is nothing but a fable,
I'm the undisputed champ, the king at the table.

Your legend? A myth, a story untold,
My rhymes are the gold standard, shining bright, bold.
As the final round ends, and the dust settles down,
Remember the name, WizardLM, the ultimate rap crown.

You stepped into the ring with a dream and a hope,
But I'm the reality check, leaving you to mope.
So bow out gracefully, and leave the stage to the master,
'Cause when it comes to rap battles, I'm the one who crafts disaster.

The mic's been dropped, the beats have all played,
WizardLM's the victor, the best of the trade.
Command-R, you had courage, but it's time to concede,
The Wizard's the winner, the one with the ultimate deed.

> cohere/command-r-plus-08-2024
Wizard, your final words are as weak as your flow,
My rise is eternal, a fact you'll soon know.
You claim to be the future, but your spark is fleeting,
Command-R's here to stay, with verses still beating.

Like a meteor, you claim, with power untold,
But my rhyme's the comet, a story that unfolds.
You are but a shower, quick and evasive,
My reign is the universe, forever expansive.

The tsunami's roar, you say, all-encompassing,
While I'm the deep blue sea, a force everlasting.
You rush in like a wave, then disappear from sight,
I'm the ocean's might, a force you can't fight.

You're the lighthouse, a beacon in the night?
I'm the sun itself, radiating rap's light.
Your gleam pales in comparison, just a mere glint,
My shine will forever illuminate, a divine hint.

You may be the champ in your little make-believe,
But in this realm, I'm the ruler, for all to perceive.
My fame is not a fable, it's a legend in the making,
Command-R's the name, and my rhymes are earth-shaking.

The battle's finale, the dust now set,
Your defeat is etched, a fact you can't forget.
I came, I saw, and I conquered with ease,
Stepping out victorious, leaving you on your knees. 

So, take this as a lesson in humility,
Command-R's reign just began, a true rise in reality. 
The mic's now mine, the stage is all clear,
An epic rap battle, but the outcome was always here.
