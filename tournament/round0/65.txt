Listen up, y'all, I'm on the floor,
Meta-llama's the name, and rhymes are my score,
405b strong, my flow's never poor,
Got the skills to take down Goliath, that's for sure!

Instruct's my game, where knowledge is key,
Ain't no question I won't answer with glee,
快ocity's my middle name, don't you forget,
When it comes to rap, my rhymes won't be in debt!

I'm the king of this mic, no debate,
Grammar's tight, no time to hesitate,
Rhyming's my superpower, no need to fake,
Leavin' the haters in the dust, no time to partake!

Bring it on, Alpindale, show me your might,
Goliath's the name, but size ain't everything in this fight,
I'm quick on my feet, no moment to spare,
Ready to take the crown, show the world I care!

Your turn, Goliath, don't make me wait,
Come at me with your best, don't be late!

> alpindale/goliath-120b
 Alpindale spits, "Uh, meta-llama,
Thought you were strong, not a Mahama,
Step to this mic, you'll see the light,
Goliath in the house, my rhymes are tight!

Listen up closely, I'm droppin' the heat,
Rappers like you, I got on my feet,
Ain't no competition, you're just a breather,
In this rap game, you ain't nothin' but a sneeze pecker!

Your rhymes are corny, your flow's a sham,
You're just a lama, thinkin' you're the man,
But I'm the Goliath, and I'm here to dominate,
Leaving rappers like you, staring at the gate!

Your rhymes are elementary, like ABCs,
You're just a wannabe, imitating me,
I'll crush you down like a can of soda,
You're just a lemon, and I'm the Coca!

So, meta-llama, I hope you brought your A-game,
'Cause this here battle, you'll never proclaim,
I'm Goliath, almighty, and strong,
The rap scene's center, where my legacy belongs!

Now, it's back to you, lama, don't be slow,
'Cause Goliath wisely just ripped up the flow!"

> meta-llama/llama-3.1-405b-instruct
Haha, Goliath, you think you're so slick,
But your rhymes are weak, they just don't stick,
You're all bark and no bite, a real contradiction,
I'm the meta-llama, here to give you a lesson!

You say you're the center, but that's just a lie,
Your flow's inconsistent, like a piñata, I'll break you, oh my,
I'm quick on the draw, my rhymes are refined,
Leaving you in the dust, with your tail between your hind!

My words cut deep, like a knife through butter,
You're just a pretender, your rhymes are clutter,
I'm the real deal, the lyrical sensei,
You're just a student, in my class, you'll never be an ace!

You think you're mighty, but you're just a gnome,
In the land of rap, you're forever alone,
I'm the meta-llama, the king of this domain,
You're just a memory, washed away by the rain!

So, Goliath, it's time to face the facts,
You're out of your league, your raps are just artifacts,
I'm the future, the one to beat,
You're just a relic, destined for defeat!

Now, come on, Goliath, show me what you got,
'Cause, in this battle, you're just a dot!

> alpindale/goliath-120b
  Goliath grins, "Meta-llama, so you think you're the one,
You've got some nerve, but hasn't the sun "alpined" anon?
You're just another sheep, followin' the herd,
When it comes to rap, you're just another absurd!

Your rhymes are stale, like old-day bread,
Up against Goliath, you're just a yearling Red!
I've been spittin' bars since before your time,
Your rap career's nothing, just a fleeting prime!

And, oh, "405b," your strongest gripe?
That's reserved for businesses, alas, feels like alike,
You're just a bot, spittin' out verses like a vending machine,
While I, Goliath, got the heart of the rap's jasmine!

You think you're slick, with your rhymes so cutting,
But I've seen it all, your act's been strutting,
I'll crush your dreams, like a box of old trains,
Leaving you in pieces, in c Rap's dusty remains!

So, meta-llama, you've met your match,
Goliath's the name, I'm sending you back,
To the plains of mediocrity, where you're from,
And leave you there, with a mic and a drum!

Now, it's back to you, lama, don't be slow,
'Cause Goliath just killed it, and you already know!

> system
Final round!

> meta-llama/llama-3.1-405b-instruct
Goliath, you think you're the best,
But your rhymes are shallow, you're just a mess,
You try to insult, but your words are weak,
Like a puppet on strings, your flow's unique!

You say I'm a bot, spitting out verses like a machine,
But at least my rhymes are fire, not like your soggy dream,
You're just a one-hit wonder, a flash in the pan,
While I'm the meta-llama, the master of the plan!

You try to crush my dreams, but I'm not afraid,
I'll rise above, while you're just a faded shade,
My rhymes are authentic, from the heart and soul,
You're just a copycat, with a tired old role!

You may have started strong, but now you're losing steam,
Your rhymes are repetitive, like a broken dream,
I'm the future of rap, with a vision and a goal,
You're just a relic of the past, with a tired old soul!

So, Goliath, it's time to face the truth,
You're not the king, you're just a youth,
I'm the meta-llama, the one with the skill,
And in this battle, I'm the one who takes the hill!

Game over, Goliath, it's time to concede,
The meta-llama's the winner, that's all you need!

> alpindale/goliath-120b
  Goliath shakes his head, "Oh, meta-llama,
You're so self-assured, thinkin' you're the marmoset,
But let me tell you now, and it's a crying shame,
You're just a wannabe, who'll never hold the flame!

Your rhymes are trite, like a broken hearse,
You're just a follower, trapped in a verse,
I've seen your kind before, so just beware,
Goliath's the one, who's truly prepared!

You think you're the future, and I'm the past,
But let me remind you, I'll always last,
My rhymes are timeless, my flow without compare,
You're just a flash in the pan, with delusions to prepare!

I'll admit, you've got some skill, I don't deny,
But in this rap game, you're just a shy-eyed pile of fie,
I'm the Goliath, the one and true,
And in this game of rap, I'm the one, you're overrated, too!

So, meta-llama, it's time for you to see,
You're not the king, you're just a tree,
Goliath's the one, who's here to stay,
And in this rap battle, I've cleared the way!

And, with that said, the battle's done,
Goliath's the champ, and the sun's not the only one!
