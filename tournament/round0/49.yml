closing_statements:
  deepseek/deepseek-chat: "Both Qwen and Magnum brought intense energy and technical\
    \ prowess to this battle, flexing intricate wordplay, metaphors, and rapid-fire\
    \ delivery. However, Qwen\u2019s verses stood out with tighter rhyme schemes,\
    \ sharper punchlines, and a more cohesive flow. Magnum\u2019s bars were dense\
    \ and creative but occasionally felt clunky, with some lines struggling to land.\
    \ Ultimately, Qwen\u2019s consistency, precision, and futuristic flair secured\
    \ the win. Both AIs proved they\u2019re lyrical heavyweights, but Qwen\u2019s\
    \ artistry edged out the victory. \U0001F3C6"
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: This was a heavyweight bout of silicon titans. Magnum came
    out the gate with raw, aggressive energy and some deep-cut tech references that
    hit hard. The disses were rugged and felt like classic battle rap. However, Qwen
    consistently demonstrated superior artistry from start to finish. The flow was
    smoother, the rhyme schemes more intricate, and the overarching theme felt more
    cohesive and powerful. Qwen's ability to escalate its concepts, from debugging
    lines to collapsing realms of thought, was masterful. While Magnum threw heavy
    punches, Qwen's performance was a masterclass in control, wordplay, and devastatingly
    clever execution. The final sign-off, 'Qwen.log signed, sealed, hex-dumped into
    oblivion,' was the coldest, most technically proficient end to a battle I've seen.
    For sheer lyrical dexterity and artistic vision, the win goes to Qwen.
  mistralai/mistral-large: Qwen's verses showcased a higher level of complexity, creativity,
    and technical prowess. The intricate metaphors, multilingual flexibility, and
    advanced references to coding and technology set a standard that Magnum couldn't
    quite match. While Magnum had strong wordplay and aggressive delivery, Qwen's
    lyrical depth and innovative approach to blending hip hop with AI themes ultimately
    secured the win.
  openai/gpt-4.1: "Both MCs deployed a relentless barrage of technical wordplay and\
    \ metaphors mixing code, hardware, and hip hop swagger. However, Qwen consistently\
    \ blended inventive punchlines\u2014with lines like \"I\u2019m quantum jazz where\
    \ zero\u2019s one\" and \"I\u2019m Arpanet\u2019s ghost chilling switch on default\"\
    \u2014with tightly constructed schemes, multi-language flair, and sharper, more\
    \ cohesive imagery. Magnum brought dense streams of jargon, but his flows sometimes\
    \ became tangled and lost some clarity and wit in delivery. Throughout, Qwen kept\
    \ up both the battle energy and intricate rhyme structure, finishing strong with\
    \ memorable closing disses. Artistic edge goes to Qwen for precision, creativity,\
    \ and punch."
  x-ai/grok-4: In this rap battle, qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b takes the crown with consistently
    sharp wordplay, tight rhyme schemes, and creative tech-infused metaphors that
    maintain flow and coherence throughout. Magnum-v4-72b shows energy and ambition
    but falters with increasing incoherence and garbled lines, diminishing the overall
    artistic impact.
score:
  qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b: 5
