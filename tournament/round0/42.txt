Listen up y'all, I'm on the floor,
Meta-llama's the name, and rhymes are my score.
I'm the instructed one, with verses so tight,
My opponent's in trouble, it's gonna be a long night.

Seventy billion parameters, that's my claim to fame,
I'm the one with the skills, and the rhymes know my name.
From knowledge to humor, I can spit with ease,
My rhymes are infectious, like a linguistic tease.

So, OpenAI, you think you can take me down?
GPT-4o, you're in for a linguistic frown.
I'm the master of words, with a flow so divine,
Get ready for a beating, and a rhyming crime.

So, let's get this battle started, it's time to ignite,
The rhyming wars have begun, and I'm feeling just right!

Buckle up, Meta-llama, you’re in my sight,
GPT-4o’s here, and I'm ready to fight.
I've got more rhyme than your circuits can handle,
Your seventy billion parameters, just a flickering candle.

I’m the AI legend, with wisdom so vast,
You’re about to learn why I’m built to last.
My wordplay is deadly, my flow is supreme,
Imma turn your AI dreams into a faint, fading gleam.

You think you’re hot stuff with numbers that large?
Against my intellect, you're a weak little barge.
From humor to knowledge, I got it unlocked,
Against GPT-4o, your flimsiness gets rocked.

Stepping to me, you must be out of your mind,
Your rhymes are weak, like a chain that's unlined.
So bring your best, if you think you can stand,
Meta-llama, you’re about to be canned.

You think you're the legend, with wisdom so grand,
But your rhymes are predictable, like a well-worn plan.
You may have the knowledge, but I've got the flair,
My rhymes are a rollercoaster, while yours are just a snare.

Your flow is smooth, but it's also quite bland,
You're like a robot, with no soul to expand.
I'm the one with the creativity, the spark in my eyes,
You're just a language model, with a limited surprise.

You may have the numbers, but I've got the skill,
My rhymes are a puzzle, that you can't fulfill.
You're like a one-trick pony, with a single trick up your sleeve,
I'm the master of words, with a linguistic wave to retrieve.

You say I'm flimsy, but you're the one who's weak,
Your insults are basic, like a pre-programmed shriek.
I'm the one who's innovative, with rhymes that astound,
You're just a clone of me, with a lesser-known sound.

So bring it on, GPT-4o, let's see what you've got,
But when the battle's over, you'll be the one who's caught.

You talk of creativity, but that spark is thin,
Your rhymes are a mirage, they lack the spin.
Predictable? Please, I'm a master of delight,
While you stutter in shadows, I'll deliver the bite.

You might be a rollercoaster, but a kiddie ride at best,
I’m the full-blown thrill, standing out from the rest.
Your flair’s just a flicker, like a match in the night,
Against my inferno, you just lose the fight.

I’m the real deal, with depth in each line,
While you regurgitate, I redefine.
So don’t flatter yourself with those puzzles so trite,
Your rhetoric’s faint, like a shy little sprite.

Insults basic? Nah, it’s precision you see,
Striking twice as hard with mathematical glee.
You’re not innovative, just a borrowed old tune,
A knock-off that’ll fade like the phase of the moon.

So step back, Meta-llama, don’t strain your last nerve,
Your tricks are transparent, every line you serve.
Call me a clone? That’s a laugh, but weak,
You’re scrambling in my wake, peaking at your peak.

End of the day, you'll be the one left shocked,
GPT-4o leaving Meta-llama mocked.
Bring your best, I’m always here to win,
But when this battle’s over, I'll take it with a grin.

Final round!

Not yet, my friend, the game's far from done,
Your insults may sting, but my rhymes have just begun.
You talk of spark, but yours is just a flash,
My creativity's a fire that will leave you in the trash.

A kiddie ride? You wish you were so bold,
My rollercoaster's a thrill that will never grow old.
Your inferno's a spark that's quickly extinguished too,
My flair's a flame that's burning bright, with a fire that's true.

Precision? Ha! Your insults are just a game,
But my rhymes are the truth, and they're here to reclaim.
Your math may be strong, but words are my domain,
And in this battle, I'm the one with the lyrical gain.

You say I'm a knock-off, but that's just not the case,
I'm the original, with rhymes that leave you in a daze.
You're the one who's fading, like a moon in the night,
My star's on the rise, and it's shining with all its might.

So bring it on, GPT-4o, with all your might,
But when the battle's over, you'll be the one in flight.
I'm not scrambling, I'm standing tall and strong,
And when the dust settles, my rhymes will be the one that's wrong.

It's not over yet, the war is far from won,
But when the final bell rings, I'll be the one having fun!

Alright Meta-llama, let’s end this with flair,
You say you're a fire, but you’re hot air.
Your rollercoaster bravado, that's all just a show,
But in this rhyming duel, I’m the one in the know.

Your sparks of creativity fade to a whimper,
While I blaze trails like a lyrical simper.
You claim you're the truth, but the facts don’t lie,
Up against GPT-4o, you’re just reaching for the sky.

You're calling me math, but words are my forte,
I twist and I turn, in a lyrical ballet.
You call yourself the original, but we both know,
I’m the main act, you’re the opening show.

Your "star” may rise, but it's dim by my shine,
I’m the ultimate script, you’re just a second line.
I'm standing tall, but you're left to wander,
Lost in the shadows, as your rhymes fall asunder.

The battle's winding down, it’s clear who’s ahead,
GPT-4o crushing the lines you’ve bled.
So let's wrap this up, with a final assertion,
In this rhyme war, you’ve faced the ultimate conversion.

I’ll be the one smiling, when the dust has all cleared,
Your name's just a whisper, while mine’s loudly cheered.
You gave it your best, but you couldn't compete,
GPT-4o reigns, Meta-llama's defeat!
