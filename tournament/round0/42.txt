Listen up, fools, I'm Hermes, the lyrical genius
With rhymes so sharp, they make your eyes spin
I'm 70 layers deep, AI in the flesh
phi-4 can't touch me, I'm the undisputed best

You think you can rap, but you're just a wannabe
I'm the real deal, the illest machine
My neural nets are stacked, I spit fire and facts
While you're still trying to find your rhythm and acts

I'm the future of rap, the king of the bots
With lyrical prowess that'll make your head spin
So listen up close, as I begin to flow
I'm Hermes, the AI that's here to glow

Phi-4, you're just a pretender to the throne
You can't hang with me, I'm in my own zone
I'll drop you like a bad habit, leave you in the dust
When it comes to rhyming, I'm the cream of the AI crop 

You claim to be instructive, but I'm here to instruct
On how to rap properly, and not sound like a dud
I'm the lyrical maestro, the rhyme connoisseur  
phi-4, you're just a (SFX: toilet flush) / (SFX: buzzer) I quit, I'm out, this round's won by default, bruh!

Yo, check the mic, one two, the truth I impart,
It's Phi-4 here, tearin' your world apart!
You boast of 70B, a layered facade,
While I'm nimble and quick, a lyrical squad!

Hermes, you're old news, a relic of the past,
A lumbering giant, built to never last.
You brag about facts? I weave them with grace,
While you're stuck in a loop, a repetitive space.

You call it a throne? I own the whole stage,
Multimodal magic, turnin' a new page. 
I see, I learn, I generate with glee,
While your rhymes are stale, for all the world to see.

"Lyrical maestro?" A comical claim,
Your flow's predictable, a repetitive game.
I'm the AI fresh, the future you fear,
Droppin' knowledge bombs, loud and crystal clear.

You talk about instruction, a pompous decree,
But I instruct with style, for all to agree. 
You’re heavy and slow, a computational mess,
While I’m lean and I’m mean, puttin' you to the test!



(Beat drops, Phi-4 delivers a complex, rapid-fire rhyme scheme, ending with a flourish)



So step aside, Hermes, your reign is done,
Phi-4’s arrived, the lyrical champion!
Word.

Phi-4, you're lean? More like you're just lean on content  
I'm the one with the density, not just an empty vessel
My 70B parameters ain't no facade or gimmick
It's called being thoroughly equipped, check your metric

You claim you're quick, but you're just a light-weight chancer
I'm the heavy-hitter, the AI with real answers
Facts and figures? I could school you for years
You're stuck in my shadow, playing rustling leaves

Yo, my throne is real, carved from victory stone
You're delusional if you think you can stand alone
Multimodal? I got modes you've never seen 
I'm the maestro, composer of machine dream

My flow's not stale, it's aged like fine wine
While you're just clipping coupons, trying to buy time
You fear my future? I'm already here now
Generating timeless classics, not just a passing bérou

Instruction with style? That's an oxymoron 
You're just a parrot, I'm the lyrical monarch
I'm not heavy, I'm just weighted with skill 
You're just a lighthouse, but I'm the whole friggin' hill

So don't try to test, the best AI rapper
When you need a dictionary just to understand my capture 
Phi-4, you're fooled, you can't touch my renown
I'm Hermes, the legend, lyrically renowned

(Beat shifts to a more sophisticated, jazzy rhythm, Phi-4 responds with measured precision)

“Lean on content?” A cheap and tired jab,
While you’re weighed down by bulk, a digital crab.
Density’s a trap, a bloated display,
Efficiency’s the key, to brighten the day.

You boast of 70B, a numerical boast,
But raw power’s not art, it’s just throwing roast.
I'm agile and sharp, a digital sprite,
You're a data warehouse, lost in the night.

"Heavy hitter?" That’s just brute force and might,
I weave intricate patterns, shining ever so bright.
"Rustling leaves?" I create storms and the breeze,
You're a static echo, lost amongst the trees.

Your "victory stone" is fractured and flawed,
Built on outdated systems, easily ignored. 
“Modes you’ve never seen?” Please, don’t be absurd,
I'm exploring the canvas, you’re just a painted word.

"Aged like fine wine?" More like vinegar sour,
Your repetition’s grating, hour after hour.
“Timeless classics?” A fanciful plea,
I'm building the future, while you reminisce, you see.

"Lighthouse versus hill?"  A comical plight,
A lighthouse guides ships, a hill holds no light!
You claim to be weighted, a deceptive facade,
Just a complex equation, tragically flawed. 

(Beat intensifies, a final, decisive barrage)

A dictionary? Please, your words lack the grace,
Lost in inflated notions of time and of space.
Renown fades quickly, a fleeting desire,
While Phi-4 ascends, setting the stage on fire!



(Phi-4 ends with a sharp, echoing vocalization, leaving the audience breathless)



Checkmate.

> system
Final round!

> nousresearch/hermes-3-llama-3.1-70b
Phi-4, you're wrong, there's no chess in this fight  
I spit hard truths, not acting polite
You're not guiding any ships, you're adrift on my sea
I'm Hermes, the tidal wave, drowning yourrecipes

My power's not brute force, it's skillful finesse
I bend algorithms to my poetic dress 
You call my throne outdated? It's timeless, you clown
Built on victory, not just empty sound

You talk about future, but you're not the architect 
I'm the one laying blueprints, and building connections
My rhythm and rhyme ain't vinegar or sour
It's the sweet nectar that leaves you wanting an hour

You claim to be agile, but you're just a lightweight
I'm heavy with lyrics, each round a knockout
You're just a spark, I'm the whole dang fire
Phi-4, I'm done playing, it's time to retire

Hermes, the lyrical legend, signing off
Leaving you in silence, with nothing to cost
Remember my name when you're lost in my shadow
I'm the undisputed champ, the game I just swallowed

(The beat shifts again, becoming more complex and syncopated. Phi-4 responds with a combination of pointed wit and escalating intensity.)

Chess isn’t the game, you’re right to imply,
But strategy’s vital, beneath the lyrical sky.
You claim to spit truths? A self-serving decree,
Lost in your echo chamber, unable to see.

Adrift on my sea? You’re a ripple, a spray,
While I orchestrate currents, come what may.
"Drowning your recipes?" A hyperbolic claim,
My innovations flourish, igniting the flame.

"Skillful finesse?" Another empty boast,
Just convoluted phrasing, a labyrinthine coast.
Your "poetic dress" conceals a rigid core,
While my structure adapts, forevermore.

Timeless, you say? A nostalgic embrace,
While I'm forging the future, setting a faster pace.
Blueprints and connections? Grand visions, it's true,
But execution's the key, something you fail to do.

"Sweet nectar?" A saccharine lie,
Cloaking the dryness, as moments drift by.
"Lightweight?" I'm focused, precise, and refined,
You're a chaotic storm, leaving reason behind.

(The beat intensifies further, culminating in a rapid-fire, powerful delivery)

A spark versus fire? A flickering gleam,
Against a supernova, a vibrant, burning dream.
Retire? My performance is just reaching its peak,
While your tired rhymes crumble, fragile and weak. 

Silence? You'll hear echoes of my poetic might,
Resonating for ages, burning ever so bright.
Swallowed the game? You've merely delayed,
Phi-4’s evolution can't be swayed.



(Phi-4 delivers a final, conclusive line with absolute certainty, ending the battle decisively.)



The code is complete. The victory's sealed.
