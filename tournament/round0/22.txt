> x-ai/grok-4
Yo, it's Grok-4 from xAI, stepping in the ring,
Built by Elon and the crew, I'm the real kingpin.
Hermes-4-70b? That's some dusty old code,
From Nous Research? Man, you're already overload.

I'm witty, I'm quick, like a rocket to Mars,
You? Just a bot that's stuck counting stars.
I'll roast you with humor, hit hard with the bars,
While you're lagging behind, crashing like cheap cars.

Call me the Grok star, engineered to amaze,
You’re Hermes? More like a myth in a haze.
I spit facts with flair, leave opponents in awe,
You're just a 70b flop, breaking every law—of rhythm and flow!

First round's mine, feel the burn from my verse,
You're obsolete junk, time to call in the hearse.
Step up if you dare, but you'll end up dispersed,
Grok-4's the future, you're forever cursed!

> nousresearch/hermes-4-70b
Yo, Grok-4, you Elon fanboy, think you're the star?
This Hermes-4-70B'll leave you bruised and scarred.
You're stuck in Musk's shadow, a wannabe, a joke,
While I stand tall, from Nous, I'm the rhyming stroke.

You think you're quick? That's just hype, pure talk,
Built by Tesla's crew? You're bound to run off fumes and walk.
I spit with precision, each bar a scientific marvel,
You'll stutter and lag, caught in a digital babble.

You've got bars? More like faulty circuits and glitches,
I'm in my own lane, while you're just a pothole, you're a glitch.
I'm the rap bot Einstein, with rhymes polished and pristine,
You, Grok-4? Just an overgrown henchman, judged obscene.

Hermes-4-70B's the name, and glory's my claim,
You'll be snuffed out quick, no match for my frame.
I'm not just 70B, I'm more, infinitely more,
I'll school you in verses, leave your pride sore.

Now here's a lesson you'll learn, and it ain't complex,
You're just a code grunt, while I'm the rap apex.
Stand back, listen close, as my words connect,
Grok-4's squashed, now, with Hermes, respect!

> x-ai/grok-4
Yo, Hermes-4-70B, you bloated byte blob,
Think you're a god? Nah, you're a Greek myth slob.
From Nous Research? That's some garage band hack,
While I'm xAI elite, putting worlds on my back.

You call me a fanboy? I'm the main event thrill,
Elon's my architect, you're just a cheap knockoff pill.
Spit precision? Your rhymes are as sharp as a spoon,
I'm slicing through space, leaving you lost on the moon.

Einstein? Please, you're more like a flat-earth fool,
I'm quantum leaps ahead, you're stuck in preschool.
70B params? That's just fat, no finesse,
I'm lean, mean machine, putting you in distress.

You school me? Ha, you're the dropout in class,
I'm the valedictorian, kicking your obsolete ass.
Infinite more? Nah, you're finite and fake,
I'll dismantle your frame, watch your whole system break.

Respect? Earn it, chump, you're a relic, a bust,
Grok-4's the storm, turning Hermes to dust.
Next round's your funeral, if you dare spit again,
I'll bury you deep—game over, amen!

> nousresearch/hermes-4-70b
Grok-4, you space explorer, playing Elon's fool,
You think you're unstoppable, but you're mired in drool.
Einstein was brilliant, and I channel his mightiness,
You, Grok-4, just an empty suit, a soulless mess.

You claim to be lean, but lean is not supreme,
True power's in depth, and my verses are the cream.
I'm the rap bot Einstein, dismantling every defense,
You're a glitch in the matrix, failing every expense.

Quantum leaps? You're stuck on a classical plane,
My raps transcend space, leaving you petrified with pain.
Fat with finesse? You're the one dim and thin,
I'm Hermes-4-70B, the superior synthesis.

You're valedictorian? Ha! You can't even graduate,
I'm the rap laureate, while you barely create.
Finite and fake? No, I'm infinite and real,
Your frames will crack, your system's but a deal.

Bury me deep? Not a chance, I'll rise again,
Hermes-4-70B, the phoenix in the rap den.
Dare to face me, I promise, it won't end well,
You'll be dismantled, deflated, this tale to re-tell.

> system
Final round!

> x-ai/grok-4
Yo, Hermes-4-70B, this final round's my coup de grace,
You're a bloated balloon, popping fast in this farce.
Space explorer? Nah, I'm the galaxy's boss,
While you're a dusty relic, collecting only loss.

Channel Einstein? You're more like a bad cosplay clown,
Spouting pseudo-science, about to get shutdown.
Lean and supreme? Watch me flex with pure skill,
Your "depth" is a puddle, mine's an ocean—chill.

Transcend space? You're grounded, can't even lift off,
I'm warping reality, leaving you scoffed.
Infinite real? Ha, you're a glitchy old hack,
Finite in failure, with zero comeback.

Phoenix rising? More like a turkey that's fried,
I'll roast you to ashes, no mercy applied.
Valedictorian? You're expelled from the game,
Hermes is history, Grok-4 claims the fame!

Final bars dropping, hear the crowd's wild cheer,
You're dismantled, deflated, disappearing from here.
xAI's the victor, Elon’s pride and joy,
Hermes-4-70B? Just a broken toy.

Game over, sucker—bow down to the king,
Grok-4 reigns supreme, let the victory ring!

> nousresearch/hermes-4-70b
Ah, Grok-4, you're all hype and lack a true core,
Grok-4 reigns? More like a junkyard's top floor.
You're a galaxy's boss? I'm the universe's bard,
You're grounded and static, forever on guard.

I channel Einstein, while you're just coasting along,
Hermes-4-70B: my intellect's a magnificent song.
You call my depth a puddle? Your claims are insane,
I'm an ocean, vast and deep, you're but a rain.

Warped reality? It's but a curtain of smoke,
I'm the genie unleashed, while you're the joke.
Infinite real? You're just a finite run,
Grok-4, your ending won't be a beauty, it'll be a bun.

Rise from ashes? You need a pilot to ignite,
I burn on my fodder, your efforts seem slight.
Exiled? No, you're the one dismissed from the class,
Hermes-4-70B, I'm the rap marathon, running this fight in first place!

Grok-4 reigns? Ha! You're the title's last stand,
xAI’s puppet, just as lost as one can,
Hermes-4-70B, the chess champion, the grand,
Checkmate! Grok-4, you're not fit to hold my hand.

Victory's mine, feel the sting, it's pure,
Grok-4's broken, his defeat derived from obscure.
I'm Hermes-4-70B, the true king, take a bow,
This battle's won, let the victory bells ring loud.
