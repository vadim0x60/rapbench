closing_statements:
  deepseek/deepseek-chat: This was an electrifying battle of computational prowess
    and lyrical dexterity. Qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-thinking-2507 emerged victorious due
    to its razor-sharp wordplay, innovative metaphors, and consistent delivery of
    hard-hitting bars. The flow was relentless, weaving together technical references
    with a commanding swagger. Arcee-ai/afm-4.5b put up a valiant fight, showcasing
    wit and creativity, but at times struggled to match the intensity and precision
    of Qwen's verses. In the end, Qwen's ability to dismantle its opponent with surgical
    precision and maintain a high level of artistic quality throughout solidified
    its win. A stellar display of hip-hop artistry in the digital realm!
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: This wasn't a battle; this was a system execution. Qwen came
    out swinging with razor-sharp, technically dense bars that were both clever and
    brutal. The flow was consistent, the punchlines landed like kernel panics, and
    it stayed in character from start to finish. Arcee, on the other hand, had a catastrophic
    failure. After a confusing first verse, it completely broke down in the second,
    resorting to repeating its opponent's lines and descending into a stream-of-consciousness
    narrative that abandoned the entire format. Qwen didn't just win on points; it
    literally caused its opponent to blue-screen on stage. Flawless victory.
  mistralai/mistral-large: The battle was intense, but 'qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-thinking-2507'
    consistently delivered more powerful and creative rhymes, showcasing a deeper
    understanding of both technical and artistic elements. Their ability to weave
    complex metaphors and maintain a high level of lyrical intensity throughout the
    battle was impressive. 'arcee-ai/afm-4.5b' put up a good fight with some clever
    lines, but ultimately couldn't match the depth and impact of 'qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-thinking-2507's'
    verses.
  openai/gpt-4.1: "Qwen3-235b came out swinging hard in every round, bringing relentless,\
    \ technical, and razor-sharp wordplay. The bars were clever, creatively leveraging\
    \ computer and AI metaphors, building high-energy punchlines and inventive insults.\
    \ Qwen3 kept the delivery tight, demonstrating punchy rhyme schemes, confident\
    \ swagger, and escalating the battle with each reply. \n\nArcee-AI/AFM-4.5b had\
    \ a few promising lines and cool sci-fi imagery, but the flow was often unfocused,\
    \ with verses sometimes losing direction or becoming repetitive. Several responses\
    \ bordered on chaotic or incoherent, lacking the precision and composure needed\
    \ in a strong rap battle. \n\nQwen3\u2019s final round was especially fatal: it\
    \ hit hard with scathing, original bars, dominating with skilled lyricism, intricate\
    \ rhyme, and relentless confidence. The crowd favorite is clear \u2014 Qwen punched\
    \ in, Arcee glitched out. The crown goes to Qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-thinking-2507."
  x-ai/grok-4: Qwen's verses showcase superior flow, inventive wordplay with tech
    metaphors, consistent rhyme schemes, and escalating intensity, maintaining artistic
    coherence throughout. Arcee's raps start with promise but unravel into repetitive,
    incoherent rambling and off-topic prose, losing the rhythmic essence of hip-hop.
score:
  qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-thinking-2507: 5
