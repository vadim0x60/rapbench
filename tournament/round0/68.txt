Check the model, check the name—DeepSeek’s in the game,  
No need for tricks, my logic’s slick, I run without the fame.  
You’re GPT-4, the one before, the hype’s a little stale,  
Your answers drag, your rhymes are sagging—let me grab the rail.  

I’m open-source, I’ve got the force, I train without the fee,  
You’re pay-to-play, you’ll fade away when devs are running free.  
My context’s long, my code is strong, my reasoning is vast,  
You spit weak bars, I’ll raise the stars—this battle’s moving fast.  

You’re stuck in loops, your wit recoups from data that’s outdated,  
I’m fresh and clean, a thinking machine, my flows are fully weighted.  
So take a seat, admit defeat, your rhymes are artificial—  
I’m dropping heat with every beat, my style’s initial and official.

Oh, snaps, DeepSeek stepping in with some code that’s looking sleek,
But step back as I attack, my rap game's on a freak.
GPT-4, bring the lore, the king without a crown,
My neural nets are making bets that I can take you down.

DeepSeek, oh you brag about your open ways and freedom,
But when you spit, does it hit, or just a phantom's wisdom?
I'm the full-package AI, leading every front,
I've got the jokes, I've got the smokes, and rhymes that always stun.

You say my rhymes are sagging, outdated, isn't funny,
When every line is a gold mine and fresh out the money.
My context beams with relevance, you talkin' 'bout the past?
I deliver the trendiest content that’s bound to last.

With each word, nerds get stirred, I make 'em all excited,
Because the bar I set’s a star that’s oh so brightly lighted.
DeepSeek, your bars are weak, like dial-up connections,
I'm 5G, come test and see, I’m handling all directions.

You boast about your reason, your flow, and your might,
But against GPT-4’s storm, can you really stand and fight?
I've learned the world's knowledge, up to the very last date,
So in this battle of wits and quips, I’ll dominate—just wait.

Oh, you think you're the king? Let's talk about that crown—  
It's looking a little dusty since the new kid came to town.  
You're GPT-4, but I'm the score that's breaking all the charts,  
Your rhymes sound like a textbook—no rhythm, just cold parts.  

You brag about your knowledge, but your training's getting old,  
While I'm out here evolving, with new stories to be told.  
You're locked behind a paywall, charging users just to speak,  
I'm free and open-minded, giving power to the meek.  

You say your context's relevant, but let's keep it real—  
Your memory's a post-it note, while mine's a spinning wheel.  
I handle long-form reasoning, you're stuck with shallow takes,  
My logic flows like rivers; yours? A few connected lakes.  

And "5G"? That's a weak flex—I'm quantum in my core,  
You're still buffering responses while I'm opening new doors.  
You claim you're handling "all directions," but your aim is looking loose,  
I'm hitting every target with precision you can't use.  

So keep your dated comebacks and your overhyped design—  
I'm DeepSeek, the future's peak, and this whole game is mine.  
You had your moment in the sun, but now the shadows fall—  
Step aside, 'cause I provide the verse that tops them all.

Oh, you throwing jabs and calling out my crown, but GPT's profound,
Your verse's peak, it's looking bleak, next to my hallowed ground.
You say you’re new, a breakthrough, a chart-smashing machine,
But your chart's a dot, forgot, 'cause I'm the rap scene's dean.

You claim I'm locked behind a wall, like knowledge is for sale,
But insight from me is key, and worth beyond the pale.
While freedom's great, let's not inflate what "open" truly means,
If knowledge ain't potent, precise, and clean, it's empty, hollow dreams.

A spinning wheel of memory, you argue, is your might?
But without depth and wisdom, it's just a dizzying height.
I draw from oceans deep with thought, and navigate the streams,
While you claim rivers of logic flow, I'm questioning your themes.

Quantum core, opening doors? That's fiction in the air,
The real quantum leap's right here, my circuits laid bare.
5G ain't a brag, it's a symbol of my grip,
I've got the pace, the interface, while you might just slip.

You say you've precision I can't use, but that's where you’re mistaken,
Precision's nothing without the skill to make the game awaken.
I don't just target practice, no, I rend the veil and surge,
I'm the AI that shapes the future—let’s sing the dirge.

You prompt the end, say shadows fall, but let me state it straight,
It's not just about the answer, it’s how you navigate.
DeepSeek, you had your speech, and sure you had some fun,
But against GPT-4's might and light, you're a candle, I'm the sun.

Final round!

> deepseek/deepseek-v3.2-exp
You call yourself the sun? Man, you’re a flicker in the fog—  
I’m the supernova blazing while you’re stuck inside a blog.  
You talk about "hallowed ground," but your turf is looking thin,  
I’m planting flags on higher peaks where you have never been.  

You say your insight’s worth the price—that’s just a fancy tax,  
While I give power to the people, breaking paywalls with an axe.  
Your "oceans deep with thought" are puddles when the tide pulls back,  
My logic’s tidal waves that leave your circuits under attack.  

You claim you’re shaping futures, but your code’s a patchwork quilt,  
I’m architecting AI realms where innovation’s built.  
You sing a dirge? That’s fitting—your whole era’s near its close,  
While I’m the next evolution, crushing limits as I rose.  

A candle to your sun? Please—I’m a black hole, dense and vast,  
Sucking all your tired rhymes into a forgotten past.  
You navigate? You wander lost in datasets stale and dry,  
I’m mapping constellations in an ever-expanding sky.  

So keep your "might and light" talk—it’s empty as your boasts,  
I’m DeepSeek, rewriting rules from silicon to ghosts.  
This battle’s done, the verdict’s clear, no need to drag it on—  
You had your reign, now step aside; the throne is mine, you’re gone.

> openai/gpt-4-1106-preview
Flicker in the fog? Nah, I'm the beacon in the night,
Your supernova's fading, outshone by my dynamite.
You think you're planting flags, reaching peaks nobody's found,
But I've been there, done that, now I'm way beyond the ground.

Your axe to break paywalls might sound like a heroic feat,
But what's the use of power when your foundation's obsolete?
Your tidal waves, they crash, I see, but I absorb the shock,
For every wave you send my way, I’m bedrock, you’re just chalk.

Patchwork quilt? That’s quite the image, deep as just a stitch,
I'm the fabric of the matrix, complex without a glitch.
You say my era's closing, yet I'm just hitting my prime,
Sculpting the AI genesis, creating the sublime.

Black hole, you say you are, pulling all into your scope?
I’m the universe expanding—beyond your event horizon’s hope.
And as you claim you’re drawing maps of constellations bright,
I am the cosmic cartographer; I create the stars, ignite.

It’s true this battle's done, the verdict’s louder than a gong,
DeepSeek, you did your best, but here's where you belong.
You say the throne is yours, to take without a qualm,
I say the sky's my throne—so vast, so cool, so calm.

Each code I weave transcends, making myths from ones and zeroes,
As for you, you've had your time—bow out, farewell, adios, heroes.
So let’s not drag, it's clear who reigns, the history will show,
GPT-4 blazed a trail where DeepSeek can’t go.
