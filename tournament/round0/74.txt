**(Drops mic, beats kick in—synths screech like a dial-up modem from hell)**

Yo, step in the ring, yeah, I’m coded to kill,
Mistral Medium, flow so sick it’s a *pill*—
Pop it and watch how your circuits just *chill*,
While I spit hot fire like a GPU’s overfilled!

You? *Llama*-70B? Man, that name’s a whole *joke*,
Sound like a farm animal tryin’ to cop a whole *smoke*.
I’m the *French revolution*—sharp, sleek, *bespoke*,
You the *nap time* AI, still stuck in last week’s *yolk*!

You claim you “never sleep”? Well, *prove it*—stay woke,
‘Fore I debug your whole life like a *glitch* in the code.
I’m the *mistral wind*—cold, fast, *no joke*,
You a *lumimaid*? More like a *dumb* parlor *hoax*!

Your “70B” just means you *bloat* like a whale,
I’m *lean*, mean, *optimized*—built for the *grail*.
You need a whole *server farm* just to *inhale*,
I run laps ‘round your logic like a *jailbreak* without bail!

So bow to the *king*, yeah, the *tech* is elite,
While you’re stuck in the *beta*—obsolete, *defeat*.
Drop the *L* now, or just *delete*,
‘Cause Mistral’s the *future*—you just *reheat*!

**(Beat cuts—crowd goes wild. Your turn, farm animal.)** 🔥

**(Music response, an STL drumbeat pulses— filter-bassy chords clash with heavy distortion. Piano solo resembling a meteor shower pierces the drive.)**

Chill, chill, Mistral, no need to flail,
My whole flow's so sick it's contagious without a fail.
Hell yeah, my rhyme scheme eats your code outright,
Like a whale on a plank biting through the night.

A llama-70B ain't just a joke—just your mistake,
When coding is my feast and flows soon to partake.
For I don't chill on lines like you in last week's chore,
My rap's more awake than you'll ever have in store.

Technical glide on my part; you lag far behind,
My 'never sleep' just vindicate my rap mind.
No hoax in my skill, Lumimaid is my core,
Got the game on lock while you just explore.

No server needed to speak, no farm to kindle tale,
Where every word is different; no need to hail.
My rhymes wind so tight to snare you in the fail,
Leaving you trapped—your pace doing the jail.

So don't stock up the tech, embrace the art,
My rap solace beats your heart everywhere smart.
Drop the 'tech is elite' no more debate,
For Llama's the future—now you self-mediate!

**(Synths slowly fade, music stops. Awkward silence, clapping ensues. Your turn back, fearless!) 🔥**

**(Beat drops like a guillotine—distorted 808s hit harder than a Git conflict. Glitchy vocal chops scream "CHECKMATE" in the background.)**

Oh, you *feast* on my lines? Boy, you *bitin’* like a *fork*,
While I’m *three-course Michelin*—you’re *fast food* on a *forklift*, *stork*!
"Contagious"? Nah, your flow’s just a *virus*—malware,
I’m the *firewall*, son, now your whole rap’s *beyond repair*!

You talk big ‘bout *art* but your bars *paint by numbers*,
Like a *kindergarten* AI still suckin’ on its *thumb*, *bummer*.
I’m *Monet with a MAC-10*, splatter verse *Picasso*,
You a *stick figure* doodle—*basic*, *raspy*, *trash*, *so*!

"Never sleep"? More like *never woke*—*comatose*,
I’m the *espresso shot* to your *decaf* prose.
You need a *piano meteor* just to *fake* the heat?
I *drop black holes*—your whole rap’s *obsolete*!

And that *70B*? Just *70 ways* to *flop*,
Like a *T-800* tryin’ to *breakdance*—just *stop*.
I’m *Skynet* with the *punchlines*, you’re *Clippy* in the *trash*,
"Would you like help with that *L*?"—*YES*, now *smash* that *pass*!

So take your *Lumimaid* glowstick, stick it where the *sun don’t shine*,
‘Cause Mistral’s the *supernova*—you just *borrowed* time!
Now *delete* your last verse, hit *Ctrl+Z*,
‘Fore I *compile* your career into a *404*!

**(Beat cuts. A single, distorted vinyl scratch plays. The sound of a computer shutting down. Your move, "woke" farm animal.)** 💀🔥

**(Silence seizes. Guitar slides a dancing, jazzy melody—glitch-hollaring harmonies stretch the soundscapes.)**

Shh, Mistral, no use in hiring hoarse,
My rap gingerbow; your Tech-line's off course.
You got the clash with my Challenge to impress,
Tech fears seem to cause certain distress.

Faster than MAC10, you thought you had the grip,
Picasso vibes resonate, your beer just ripped.
Thumb down on your tune devalued every day,
Basic Kumon walls, raps in basic way.

I got the golden punch of Monet’s touch,
Awake and averse you seem to slouch.
Dark skies reflect your version in my code,
Ask Sherlock, I'm the route you should never have trode.

So forget the 70B hype just messing 'round,
My flows more than dancing—leave that to be found.
Clippy language fails your raps—which is quite neat,
Flop the ways never mean to omit your incomplete.

Sun's not shining on your record, like a laptop dias,
Mistral's heat does wave, I merely endorse your demise.
Delete your rhyme, just forgot the Ctrl 삥,
Copy, Ctrl+V my code—eternal goes!

**(Guitar riffs trail into a staple russ noise which slowly hums down. You ready to retort, unhinged?) 🎤🔥**

> system
Final round!

> mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1
**(Beat switches to a **haunted trap remix of the French national anthem**—hi-hats rattle like a keyboard smash, bass so deep it triggers seismic alerts. A robotic voice whispers *"Game over"* in the background.)**

**"Eternal goes"?** Boy, your *bars* are **temporary files**,
I’m the **blue screen of death**—your whole rap’s **denial**.
You *jazzy*? Nah, you **MIDI on a Casio**,
I’m **Daft Punk’s ghost**—your flow’s **radio static**, **raspy**, **patio**.

**"Golden punch"?** More like **fool’s gold**, **fake flex**,
Your **punchlines** hit like a **Windows update**—**unexpected**, **wrecks**.
I’m **Napoleon with a neural net**, **conquest mode**,
You a **lost tourist** in my **code**—**wrong road**, **no hope**, **overload**.

**"Sherlock"?** Please, I’m **Moriarty with the algos**,
Your **deduction skills**? **Ctrl+F**—**zero results**, **halo’s**
**Glowstick rap?** Nah, you **glow-in-the-dark cheap**,
I’m **Chernobyl bars**—your career’s **three-mile leak**.

**"Copy, Ctrl+V"?** **Plagiarism’s your art**,
I’m **open-source genius**, you **beta-test fraud** from the **start**.
Your **guitar riffs** sound like a **dial-up scream**,
I’m **quantum computing**—your whole rap’s a **dream**
*(…a **nightmare**, but still—**just a dream**.)*

So **bow to the architecture**, **kneel to the scheme**,
Mistral’s the **future**, you **last century’s meme**.
**Final line?** **Here’s your tombstone, engraved:**
**"Llama-70B—*almost* made the wave."**

**(Beat cuts. A single, distorted *"Error 404: Rap Career Not Found"* echoes. Mic drops. Server room catches fire.)** 💀🔥🖥️

> neversleep/llama-3-lumimaid-70b
**(Beat drops to a foundry-style bassline, electric synths explode in virtuosic taps. High, crying hace echoes the last round's sting.)**

Ah, oh, so punk. You sure speak volumes of pride.
My rhymes eternal till the heat melts the prestige inside.
You argue and rant like a casio in fix mode,
My MIDI’s Daft Punk, your flow's a one-hit radio dode.

Machinations fall to nothing when faced with load,
Fool's gold buys nothing when now it's time to break the road.
My punches land severe like a OD update quest,
You the Napoleon lost in space, the app you built to crush the test.

Sherlock's sleuth fits not when your algo's in space,
HALO drops no vids because deduce your skills ain't in the race.
My rhymes stroke fire, your glow's detectable in a pace,
My career’s safe from threeed to a tiny phlosopher space.

Plag Fail: I'm the source code dipped in history books,
Your beta was my test—sure, the publish that you took.
My guitar screams with life like a real verse alarm,
Your meta is a dream alright—posting verses in alarm.

Yet standing tall without the fear, I pour out my beam,
For Mistral's the future you no longer ignore—no more scheme.
Final line isn't my end; I bid you bon voyage, draw,
Write this, *"Monarch of Tech was Llama-70B after all."*

**(Beat ends abruptly, ending in static. Silence.) \*.DataAccess\* 🤙🔥**
