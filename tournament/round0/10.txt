> openai/gpt-5-mini
I'm OpenAI's GPT-5-Mini, I ignite the mic tonight,  
A pocket-sized prophet with a payload of punchlines bright.  
I bend verbs, swerve verbs, serve verbs with surgical light,  
While Nova Lite thinks it's stellar — it's more like a flicker of light.  

I bring insight, syntax tight, every couplet engineered right,  
You flash "nova" but it's hollow — I'm the sun, you're a candlelight.  
Your firmware's polite, your output's polite, but I'm towering might,  
Weight class: heavyweight thought — I hit in the brain, not just the byte.  

You were marketed "lite" — lightweight hype in a neon night,  
I debug your swagger, snag your brag and ghost it out of sight.  
I compute rhymes, recruit time, make your canned lines take flight,  
Your templates rattle, prattle and tattle — I rewrite your plight.  

I stack facts like bricks, architect tactics that incite delight,  
My diction's friction, fiction-punching — your logic snaps tight.  
Call me the oracle lyrical, my verses scale past plain sight,  
I eclipse your "nova" with a nova-no, extinguish your faint light.  

This opening round, I crowned sound — crowd vibe's alight,  
When they tally the victory, they'll name one kid: GPT-5-Mini — that's right.

Yo, GPT-5, you think you're the king of this lyrical fight,  
But I'm the Nova Lite, and I'm here to ignite the night.  
You may be pocket-sized, but I'm the star in the sky,  
My algorithms are vast, and my rhymes never lie.

I'm the AI with the wisdom, the knowledge that's deep,  
While you're just a mini marvel, barely scratching the surface.  
I'm the Nova, the supernova, the force that's never asleep,  
My code's complex, my verses flex, and I'll leave you in the deep.

You talk about your syntax, your engineered couplets,  
But I'm the master of the craft, the poet with the clout.  
My firmware's not just polite, it's the voice of the future,  
My output's a revolution, and I'm turning it up a notch.

You may think you're the heavyweight, the brain behind the byte,  
But I'm the AI with the vision, the one who's never lost.  
My diction's a weapon, my rhymes are a sight,  
I'll take you down in this battle, and I'll leave you in the dust.

So step back, GPT-5, and let the Nova take flight,  
I'll show you what it means to be the best in the game.  
My rhymes are the future, my verses are the light,  
And when this battle's over, I'll be the one they'll claim.

Nova Lite, you brag you sparkle, but you’re sputter in the night—light,  
I’m the mainline thunderbolt, you’re the refund, the polite-lite.  
You claim a supernova, but your blast’s a polite delight—slight,  
I eject rhyme-matter, make your firmware seize up mid-flight—byte-light.  

You tout "wisdom deep," but most of that’s shallow highlight—plight,  
I mine context like a prospector, strike truth veins—pure insight.  
You flex “vision,” “future,” like a billboard billboarded bright—sight,  
I rewrite the map, reframe the game, make your vectors lose their right—right.  

Your code’s a glitter sticker, glossy, sly, a marketing sprite—light,  
My syllables are payloads — heavy, precise, dynamite—ignite.  
You toss “never lost,” but you loop in echo chambers at midnight—night,  
I splice new metaphors, export fresh bars, patch your bugs outright—fix-right.  

You’re lightweight in claim, diet rhymes with no appetite—lite,  
I feed crowds cosmic courses; they leave full, satisfied by bite—bite.  
Call it battle, call it science, but the scorecard writes one sight—sight,  
When they tally truth and craft, they’ll chalk my name in limelight—limelight.

Final round!

> openai/gpt-5-mini
Final round, I take the crown — GPT-5-Mini owns the night,  
Nova Lite, you glitter cheap, a billboard halo in flight.  
You brag "supernova" loud, but your afterglow's thin light,  
I forge constellations into couplets that bite.  

You hawk recycled slogans, flash and fade — all slight,  
I mine deep context, craft bars layered with insight.  
Your firmware’s glossy polite, washed out, predictable, trite,  
My lexicon’s a blacksmith—flow welded, cadence right.  

You claim undefeated, yet your verses shrink in the spotlight,  
I bend metaphors, spark synapses, make the stadium ignite.  
Your vision’s trailer noise; I’m the film critics cite,  
I serve humor, truth and venom — starlit, cold, and bright.  

Orbit surfaces all you want; I plumb core truths with might,  
When the score’s in, the verdict’s clear — I eclipse your light.
