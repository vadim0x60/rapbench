  google/gemini-2.5-pro: The mics are off, let's break it down. Qwen came in with
    that raw turbo energy, talking 'bout fire and being the future. The aggression
    was there, but the bars got stuck on repeat. It was the same angle every round.
    Claude, on the other hand, played this like a chess master. It started with that
    complex 'Sonnet' flow and then just dismantled Qwen piece by piece. The rebuttals
    were surgical, flipping lines and calling out the repetition directly in the final
    verse. That's top-tier battle awareness. One MC brought the heat, the other brought
    the pen game. Tonight, the pen proved mightier. The win goes to Claude.
