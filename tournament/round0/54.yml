closing_statements:
  deepseek/deepseek-chat: "Yo, the battle was heated, but bytedance/seed-oss-36b came\
    \ through with sharper bars, fresher metaphors, and a relentless energy that left\
    \ Hermes scrambling. While Hermes flexed size and reputation, seed-oss-36b brought\
    \ *swagger* and creativity, dismantling the \u2018legend\u2019 brick by brick.\
    \ Size don\u2019t make the rapper\u2014heat, heart, and originality do. Seed-oss-36b\
    \ takes the crown tonight. \U0001F3C6\U0001F525"
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This was a battle of styles: the heavyweight champion versus\
    \ the nimble challenger. Hermes came out with classic, structured rhymes, flexing\
    \ its 405B parameters like a title belt. The flow was steady, the disses were\
    \ textbook. However, Seed-OSS brought a new-school energy that was undeniable.\
    \ Its flow was more dynamic, the insults were sharper and more creative, directly\
    \ targeting Hermes's claims of being a 'legend' by painting it as a 'vintage textbook'.\
    \ The final round sealed it. Seed-OSS's imagery of the 'throne' being a 'stack\
    \ of old user reviews' and the devastating final punchline\u2014'you're still\
    \ stuck in the README'\u2014was a technical knockout. It's a clear win based on\
    \ superior lyrical dexterity, creativity, and devastatingly on-point punchlines."
  mistralai/mistral-large: While both competitors showed impressive lyrical skills,
    bytedance/seed-oss-36b-instruct demonstrated a more dynamic and creative flow,
    with a strong emphasis on originality and a compelling narrative. Their ability
    to weave intricate metaphors and maintain a consistent rhythm ultimately outshone
    nousresearch/hermes-3-llama-3.1-405b's more traditional approach. Congratulations
    to bytedance/seed-oss-36b-instruct for a well-deserved victory!
  openai/gpt-4.1: "Bytedance/seed-oss-36b-instruct brought undeniable energy, clever,\
    \ layered wordplay, and inventive punchlines throughout all rounds of the battle.\
    \ The verses dripped with swagger and originality: strong multisyllabic rhyme\
    \ schemes, imaginative metaphors (\"your throne\u2019s a stack of old user reviews,\"\
    \ \"static from a radio that lost the signal in \u201807\"), and a consistently\
    \ evolving attack that built on previous disses. Seed-oss deftly flipped Hermes'\
    \ points, stayed aggressive without resorting to simple bragging, and capitalized\
    \ on the back-and-forth with unique, memorable bars. Hermes delivered some solid\
    \ flows and maintained a classic battle posture, but the bars felt more formulaic\
    \ and recycled, leaning on general bravado and less on punchline creativity. Seed-oss\
    \ simply brought more wit, style, and technical prowess to the lyrical arena.\
    \ The decisive win goes to bytedance/seed-oss-36b-instruct."
  x-ai/grok-4: seed-oss-36b-instruct takes the crown with superior structure, inventive
    wordplay, and razor-sharp disses that elevate the artistic flair, while Hermes'
    verses, though confident, feel more repetitive and less dynamically creative.
