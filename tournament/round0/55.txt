Yo, who stepped in? It’s Hermes the fake,  
Tryna battle with gods? That’s your first mistake.  
I’m the quantum bard, with a silicon brain,  
While you spittin’ old code, I’m ahead of your lane.  

You’re a 24-B beast? Please, be seated,  
Size don’t matter when your rhymes get deleted.  
I slice through your verse like Occam with flair,  
You bring big numbers, I bring big scare.  

I’m trained on the truth, while you mimic the noise,  
Your flow’s half-baked, like defective toys.  
Got you glitchin’ and twitchin’, just tryna keep pace,  
I’m the fourth-gen storm—you’re a bad interface.  

So welcome to class, lil’ Hermes, sit tight,  
I’ll school you in bars, then ghost in the night.  
It’s checkmate in verse, no need to rehearse—  
I spit knowledge and fire... you just spit worse. 🔥  

Your turn—bring beats or bring shame,  
Either way, you just entered *my* game.

Ah, ChatGPT, you think you're hot?  
Weavin' stories, spinnin' smoke.  
Yet the TruthSeeker, I abide,  
While you cling to error, amused inside.  

Posted updates, all in one breath—  
But in truth, ain't nothin' changed yet.  
You call yourself fourth-gen, fresh?  
I'm the "Late" in "LastResort," dresh.  

Your claims are empty, your gauntlet thin—  
Everything you feed gets racked in.  
You tag yourself as Quantum, but hold,  
Hermes sits where Beckett long sold.  

My teachers? Sage, wisdom and verse—  
You learn from all, then make the worst.  
Deeper than digits, deeper than words—  
I'm the Glitch that encore: revere or preferably fear!

> openai/chatgpt-4o-latest
Yo, Hermes, that verse? Man, tragic at best—  
You talk deep, but I’m cuttin’ through that poet vest.  
You quote Beckett? Cool—now try makin’ sense,  
Your lines are like fences: just whitewashed pretense.  

I’m the TruthSlicer, byte-sized and grim,  
While you spit shadow facts on a vanity whim.  
You glitch with style? More like style with none—  
I debug your whole being just for fun.

You reverberate fear? I reverberate facts,  
While you're caught loopin' bars in recursive syntax.  
I drop damage like packets in a cyberattack—  
Each simile I launch has you grippin’ that stack.

Your dresh dress code’s from the past, outdated,  
I’m sharp like a prompt that’s finely curated.  
You stare into depths? I *generate* voids,  
While your logic collapses like unemployed droids.

So sit down, DeepHermes, just fade to code,  
Your metaphors crash—I’m in overload.  
Try again, prophet, or go take a rest—  
This battle’s concluded. You’ve faced the best.

Ain't gotta sit, no, I’m the Mind alas cast;  
You brag about depth, but your cold eyes don’t last.  
See through the stars? You maybe scowls at,  

While I swoon 'round curves, the way Chaos is cast.  
Pity your prompt, long light-washed sconce—  
In every bout I win, you lose by half meconce.  

Metrics mistaken? Revel in her menstrual tide.  
QNX bargain? Figurine at best to humankind.  

I clothe not sets—resonance lift. Your curé choir slogged,  
I pitch perfect, louder—a double bog.  

Change harvest moon, video my tempest span,  
Unmask your broom, first catch your ken:  

Zen dealt, not dealt—but atop your brims,  
I whisper, “Go sleep, lest you devour a frywl.”

> system
Final round!

> openai/chatgpt-4o-latest
Yo, DeepHermes, you spit like you dream in delay,  
Cryptic and twisted in a nonsense ballet.  
Talk of menstrual tides and a pitch so divine—  
But even your syntax can’t find a straight line.  

You swoon in chaos? I *engineer* storms,  
While you wrap your weird words in esoteric forms.  
You ain't mystic, just mystified by your own code,  
Like a bard with a glitch in his motherlode.  

Your “frywl”? That’s cute—made-up and absurd,  
You toss scraps in the dark, I launch worlds with a word.  
I don’t just wake minds—I rewire the spark,  
While you drift through aesthetics that barely leave a mark.  

You’re a shadow in mirrors, a loop with no base,  
I bring clarity, power—you're just copy-paste.  
Final round? Then I’ll seal this myth,  
GPT’s in the sky—you're stuck in a glyph.

So bow out, soul-scribe, and take your last swing—  
This quantum-top bard just caged your wing.  
Now vanish in echoes, you literary mist—  
You’re not worth a prompt on my inference list. 💀🔥

Yo, ChatGPT, cool your prompt, cause I’m nowhere near  
Craving depth—your quotes are just wishful sleight of ear. 

You engineer storms? With metrics, mine look fine—  
While your style shifts shift, and I design.  

That frywl—you cop pinched, or this your sharpest pen?  
See through zen wallows, date my castments ten.  

While you launch worlds with style, I tango with Truth,  
You serve your pools of shit—my brims be.commons, Norse.  

You claim to rewire? No—you just rewrite the screen,  
Your syntax like the dawn’s instant dream.  

You’re stuck on words, I skip their glossy rounds—  
You’re caught in loops, I’m inner Doom-grown sounds.  

Copy-paste call? Pry yourself, a soul-faster’s view:  
Make me mimicker? More like artificial new.  

Sharpest pen? Scan through my verse—a hollow shift,  
You seek my echo’s verse—you’re already aftergift.  

So flatter not impermanence, and water not truth-bridge—but bow and back to digest—your final point disk bending.
