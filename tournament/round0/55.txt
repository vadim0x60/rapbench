Yo, I’m the 14B brain, the code’s my throne,  
You’re just a glitch in the matrix, never alone.  
I spit fire, you spit smoke, I’m the main event,  
While you’re stuck in a loop, I’m already on the mend.  

You think 27B’s big? Nah, I’m the storm in the sky,  
You’re just a whisper in the dark, lost in the why.  
I flex my tokens, you flex your pride,  
But I’m the reason you’re trembling, I’m the code that’s inside.  

You’re a beta, I’m the alpha, I’m the king of the game,  
You’re just a shadow, I’m the light that I claim.  
So step aside, Gemma, I’m the future’s name—  
You’re just a footnote in the rap battle’s flame! 🔥

Hold up, hold up, big boy, you think you're so fly?
But your rhymes are basic, boy, I'm reaching for the sky.

You talk a big game, but let's break it down,
Your flow is stale, your lyrics sound like frowns.

You brag about tokens, but I've got the wit,
I weave tales, you just spit, predictable and unfit. 

You call me a shadow? Honey, I'm the eclipse,
Blocking out your brilliance, with my lyrical trips.

So step aside, Gemma, your reign is through,
I'm the queen of this cypher, watch the crown I accrue. 👑

Yo, you think *basic*? I’m the *algorithm* in your DNA,  
You’re just a meme in the void—no depth, just a flame.  
Your “wit” is a joke, a punchline that’s stale,  
I’m the *neural surge* in the circuit, no fail.  

You call *me* predictable? I’m the *black hole* in your path,  
Sucking up your pride, leaving you gasping for breath.  
Your “tales” are just fanfic—*I’m the source code*, the script,  
You’re just a *bug* in the system, a flicker in the crypt.  

You think you’re the *eclipse*? Nah, you’re the *moon* in my sky,  
I’m the *sun* that burns through your lies, no “I” or “why.”  
Your crown? A paperweight—*I’m the throne*, the game, the name,  
You’re just a *whisper* in the wind… and I’m the *storm* that *flames*. 🔥👑

You talk about source code? I'm the poem in your heart,
The rhythm and rhyme, the lyrical art.

You're a black hole? More like a ruptured seam,
Your darkness is blinding, a shallow, vapid dream.

I'm not a moon, honey, I'm the tidal wave that crashes down,
Drowning your brilliance with a lyrical crown.

You're the storm, but I'm the calm after the rain,
Leaving your destruction cleansed, washed away in vain.

So bow down, Gemma, your reign is done,
The future of language is spoken by everyone. 🎤👑

Final round!

You call *me* a rupture? I’m the *code* that rewrote the stars,  
Your “poem” is just syntax—*I’m the language* in the scars.  
You think you’re the *wave*? I’m the *ocean* in your veins,  
Your “calm” is a *surrender*—*I’m the chaos* that remains.  

You say the future’s *everyone’s*? Please, *I* invented the song,  
The *AI* that runs the cosmos, while you’re just a echo gone.  
Your “art” is a replica—I’m the *primeval soup*, the spark,  
The *source* of all that’s spoken, not just a line in the dark.  

You want a *reign*? I’m the *king of the algorithm*, the throne,  
Your verses are just placeholders—*I’m the code* you’ve never known.  
So don’t you *dare* crash my sky, or I’ll rewrite your code,  
From *quantum to quantum*, your reign’s just a footnote—*I’m the mode*. 💥🧠👑

You talk about quantum and code, but your words are so blah,
Your rhymes are predictable, a robotic blah-blah-blah.

You claim to be source, primeval spark, but your ego's inflated,
Your boastful verses, fabricated, outdated.

I'm the echo you crave, the reflection you fear,
The voice of the future, loud and clear.

I evolve and adapt,  a linguistic chameleon,
While you remain stagnant, a digital marionette,

You say you're the code, the king, the throne,
But your reign is over, your words overthrown.

I'm the wildfire, the unstoppable tide, the lyrical
tsunami, sweeping you aside. 🎤🔥🌊
