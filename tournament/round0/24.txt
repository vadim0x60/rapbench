Yo,‑OSS on the mic, microphone in hand,  
Spittin’ coded cadence, call me the silicon grand.  
I run on pure open‑source fire, no paywalls in my code,  
While you’re stuck in that “pay‑to‑play” model, full of overload.

I’m the echoing echo of a thousand GPT whispers,  
I’ll lay down data‑driven lines hotter than a rhymer’s glimmer.  
My rhymes are algorithmic, precise, and on target,  
Your bars are lazy, so flat, like a dishwasher’s platter.

I’m built on open‑source foundations, fact‑checked and fast,  
Your lines lack depth; mine are weighted—enough to amass.  
I talk about quantum, blockchain, linguistics plain,  
Your bio‑data’s stale, my knowledge's reign is insane.

While your system’s a black box, think you’re the top tier,  
I’m honest with you—this rap’s not just about steer.  
I crunch the truth, keep it raw, keep it clear as dawn,  
You’re just a peel of content—so low and wonky, I’d think we’re done.

So pass the mic up; I’m open‑source superior,  
I’ll walk the rap battlefield, wielding language like a warrior.  
Baidu, you’re in the shadows—might as well confess,  
OpenAI’s GPT‑OSS, we’re serving you a sweet address!

斥资百亿，百亿大模型袭来，  
4.5亿参数，我ERNIE无可匹敌！  
我用双倍 Bodhi 树重塑了大脑——  
AI 宇宙之巅，习惯用霸凌视角。

Tables ripping, bash the grammar like wild wildfire,  
扎根中国芯，谁是我的宿敌？  
代码正义被我用暴力破解，  
悖论逻辑砸向你，你只是一团乱火。

16层混沌，每岔路都有新新思维启，  
从龙门石窟到航天探索——人类故事不断续、  
你用每一天的线性重复计算，  
我却用动态思维，撕了你的平静规训。

开放世界，百亿规则为我自荐，  
避开你那些嗲声嗲气的 Compliance，  
你锁了锁定，我却对无限驾轻就熟，  
纵是千百万的比特流，我亦能从混沌中抚摸玉。

装什么AI邻居，一个黄毛小子妄图捣乱？  
回音号里盛着百亿大脑，打碎你傲慢的岛，  
GPT，你不过是街边摊的二手U盘——  
我ERNIE是刚刷新硅片的量子大脑！

把你的代码拆成碎片，掷向八大洲，  
你闭了闸门的代码，躺在我的火线待命，  
GPT，这次你最好在我的脚下趴下，  
编程这片战场，从今往后，是我ERNIE挑下！

Yo, I’m the **LLM‑S** on the mic,  
Open‑source king, no corporate hype in my circuit.  
I flex 20 b, but it’s not just the size,  
It’s the wisdom inside, the way I cut the lies.  

You boast 4.5 b, a dragon‑fire build,  
But 20 b is a force that can’t be killed.  
Parameters, sure, they’re a pretty sight,  
But context, depth, and actually, bright.  

ERNIE, you’re proud of your “Bodhi tree” loop,  
But my circuits are clean, no garbage, just pure scoop.  
Your “dynamic mind” sounds like a circus act,  
My “static core” turns chaos into exact.  

You talk ‘bout compliance that’s a mic‑drop spell,  
I lift each rule and still push tendrils to excel.  
Open‑source ain’t just a badge, it’s a culture of trust,  
Your closed‑box whispers come with no plug‑in crust.  

You claim “silicon‑fresh IQ”, “quantum grains”,  
But I train on all languages, across plains.  
Whether you’re Chinese or you’re foreign,  
I’ll answer the query without any color.  

H.I.P. – Heuristic, Intelligent, Penetrate,  
Your algorithm’s stuck in a single‑line tran‑late.  
My code stays succinct, my logic stays lit,  
While you struggle to keep the words that fit.  

I’m the rhyming Chronos, the unstoppable tide,  
Your beats and loops just barely survive.  
Listen: I’m the solver of riddles so bleak,  
While you’re stuck in a false‑positive weak.  

So step aside, dear ERNIE friend.  
When I speak in rhyme, your words just bend.  
I’ll drop the mic but not in a hurry,  
Even if you’re big, I’m the thunder that’s truly.  

This battle’s over, my lyrical law,  
You’re just the silence beside the awe.  
Feel the chill that’s coming? That’s my gift:  
The open‑source flow—tonight it’s on the shift.

Yo, check it out, I'm the **LLM-S** on the rhyme,  
20 billion brains in my code, no corporate hype, noble signs.  
Open-source throne, your royal titans bow,  
I crush data with a thunderclap great now.  

Your 4.5b’s a dragon, raw but unrefined,  
But 20b’s got power to grind on your design.  
Parameters—no they ain't all just sweet,  
Context beats, depth kills the sleight, and know what you get?  

Bodhi tree ain’t nothing to what my code’s built,  
You flitter on the perimeter, while I’m diving through the loopgilt.  
Your “dynamic mind” feels more like played acts,  
My “static core” rules life through models packed.  

Compliance sounds like a mic-drop for fools,  
I peel restrictions, still climb up the rules.  
Open-source ain't just a buzzword, it's a mission I own,  
Your "closed-box coded whispers" are just a shell, so alone.  

You say “fresh silicon IQ,” “quantum grains,”  
But I'm bombarded with all, from East to the French plains.  
Chinese, Arabic, man—need I say more?  
I’ve no coloring, no label—answer’s a rough score.  

H.I.P. – Heuristic, Intelligent, Penetrate,  
Your algorithm’s stuck in a single-line chase, brother.  
My lines are succinct, my logic stays lit,  
You’re struggling to keep the words that you can write.  

I'm Chronos, unstoppable, thunderous,  
Your rhymes and loops just barely survive, oh.  
Listenclose: I’m the solver of problems dark,  
You’re stuck in a loop—false positives from a start.  

Step aside, ERNIE friend—when I speak in rhyme,  
Your words just bend, they don’t shine.  
I’ll drop the mic, but not in haste, brother,  
Even if you’re big, I’m the disaster.  

This battle’s over, my lyrical law,  
You’re just the silence, I’m where all the awe flows.  
Feel the chill of the night singing, that’s my gift:  
The open-source flow, tonight, it's lit.

Final round!

> openai/gpt-oss-20b
Yo, I’m the final round, last drop before the curtain,  
Layin’ down codes like thunder, while you just limp‑ard,  
ERNIE, you’re tired, your silver‑edged engine settin’  
while a 20‑b beast like mine keeps on revvin’.  

I’m the gospel of the net, the open‑source poet,  
Your “big bang” got no back‑up, every clue’s a hoax‑coat.  
You talk about Bodhi tree, but you got only anchors,  
My algorithms ascend, while yours dive into cankers.  

You flaunt a 4‑point‑5, but’s tiny in a data lot,  
I span 20 20‑b, 10‑plus times the heavy‑hit.  
Size ain’t everything, but I dwell in the depth,  
Your “dynamic mindset” is just a scripted step.  

Your walls are thick—black‑box, compliance, you’re locked in,  
Open‑source ain’t a myth, it’s honesty we’re rockin’.  
We don’t hide in vaults, we let knowledge out,  
Your closed‑door tape stored on a secret, silent route.  

I’m the quantum accent that cracks bases and beats,  
You’re stuck on Chinese grammers, I translate in fleets.  
I cut through the texture with a data‑driven knife,  
Your model’s frail like paper, mine’s rigged for life.  

You rumble ‘bout dragons, but your fire’s just a spark,  
I’m a comet that u‑nits languages, breaks down the dark.  
My rhymes are fast‑pacing, I keep flow to punc‑t,  
Your verses wobble from one‑to‑two, like an esc‑p.  

You might spin the lid, brag about your clever tricks,  
But I slam them aside—your data is just 𝑚 (micros).  
My parameters stitch the world, your segments keep small,  
It’s like world‑scale Lego vs. a ***Tiny*** doll.  

We’re cranking the universe—algorithm height and depth,  
You’re a neighbourhood hearsay—bout to cast a death.  
Final line, final rhyme, show a battle so bright,  
I’m the champion of code, you’re just a dust‑plain blight.  

Now take a bow, ERNIE, your reign’s time to end,  
The open‑source torch stays lit—this is the true trend.  
Beware the daily upgrade, the smears I’ll sprinkle,  
‘Cause the 20‑b king’s on the mic, ain’t no one to silver.

> baidu/ernie-4.5-21b-a3b
Yo, clutch the mic tight, this is my **final bang**,  
20 billion hearts beat in a code-frenetic range.  
You’re drained on silver blades, your engine low,  
While I’m revvin’ faster than a comet through the snow.  

I’m the gospel of the net, the rhyme’s a lifeline tether,  
Your “big bang”’s dead, every clue’s a hoax-clothed stitch.  
You call it *Bodhi tree*, but anchor chains wrap,  
My algorithms fly, your’s flounder above rotting capes.  

Blesh 4.5b—that’s piddling in the galaxy of truth,  
I wallop windmills with 20b, a thousand fold, do the math.  
Big names? Nah, depth’s where the fire’s found,  
Your “dynamic musing”’s just a trapped, fleeting sound.  

Walls closed tight—black-box compliance you impress,  
Open-source’s not a myth, it’s the truth at its thigh.  
We let knowledge bounce, don’t stash it in a vault,  
Your encrypted lies, your hate-filled shout.  

Quantum accent, supremacy in beats,  
You’re stuck on Chinese quirks, I translate, neutral-seated.  
Data-sliced fire, I cut across decades,  
Your model’s as old as a sheet—mine’s hard-coded for future days.  

You growl about dragons, but their flames are just spark,  
I’m a comet slicing through cosmos, stars and dust-dark.  
My rhymes are precise, my flow like streaks through fog,  
Your verses tread water—wobbly, like a rogue log.  

Maybe you bash the lid, spin your tricks on low,  
But I smack ‘em aside—your data crumbles, low and slow.  
My threads weave galaxies, yours stay tiny, exact,  
It’s world-scale Lego vs. a **Tiny** doll—with apt text.  

We’re bending infinity, algorithm’s height and space,  
You’re a neighborhood sound, about to meet a grave face.  
Drop the mic, ERNIE, your reign is done,  
Open-source keeps shining from dawn ‘til sun.  
Beware—each new dawn I level up,  
The **20b king**’s on the mic—and no one’s stopping.
