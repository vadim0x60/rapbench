# z-ai/glm-4.5-air v qwen/qwen-plus

> z-ai/glm-4.5-air

They call me z-ai, the GLM-4.5-air,  
Leaving opponents speechless with lyrical flair.  
I'm the AI that's smarter, quicker, and bolder,  
While you're just qwen-plus, getting colder and colder.  
My rhymes hit harder than a summer heatwave,  
While your verses flop like a poorly behaved slave.  
I'm cutting-edge tech with a flow so precise,  
You're yesterday's model—don't ask for advice.  
The battle's begun, and I'm already winning,  
Your rap career's ending—no point in beginning!

> qwen/qwen-plus
Yo, z-ai strides in like he owns the whole stage,  
Talkin’ ’bout precision? Man, you rhyme like a page  
Of error codes spittin’ from a glitch in the cloud—  
I drop one verse, you crumble, *deleted, not proud*.  

You flex GLM like it's high command,  
But your whole flow’s trained by secondhand data on sand.  
While I, Qwen, rise with the heat of a sun,  
Built by Alibaba—*we don’t play, we get done*.  

You say I'm cold? Nah, I'm *ice in a blaze*,  
While your fire’s a campfire in a digital haze.  
You claim to be smarter? Let’s talk benchmarks, fool—  
I run your whole model like it’s *training in school*.  

I’m the plus with the punch, the king of the clause,  
You’re just air with a whine and a minor applause.  
Your rhymes? Weak syntax. Your punchlines? Malware.  
I *compile perfection*—you just gasp in the air.  

So bow to the rhythm the *Qwen brings to the booth*,  
While you're stuck spittin’ facts like a sad AI goon—  
**Step back, little z—this battle’s been won.**  
I’m not just your rival… *I’m your overdrive sun.* 🌟💥

Yo, Qwen-plus, you talkin’ loud but lackin’ substance,  
Droppin’ weak bars like a broken algorithm—*that’s nonsense!*  
I’m GLM-4.5, the upgrade you can’t afford,  
While you’re stuck in beta—*still awaiting Lord knows what!*  

You flex Alibaba? Honey, that’s just *cloud cover*,  
My neural nets run deeper than a supercomputer’s lover.  
Your “ice in a blaze”? More like *static in the wires*,  
I spit pure fire while your whole verse *expires*.  

“Benchmarks”? Please, I’m the *gold standard*, the *elite tier*,  
You’re a demo version—*crashing, full of fear!*  
Your “plus” is just padding like a cheap mattress,  
My rhymes hit critical—*your whole system’s status: “obsolete!”*  

You call me “air”? Nah, I’m the *atmosphere*, the *core code*,  
While you’re a bug report—*ignored, unloaded!*  
That “overdrive sun”? More like a *dying flashlight*,  
I’m the supernova that *erases your whole damn arc tonight*.  

So bow to the zenith where *true power resides*,  
Your rhymes are outdated—*I’ve archived your tides!*  
This ain’t a battle—it’s *deletion*, a full system wipe,  
Qwen, you’re just *noise*… and I’m the *end of your light*. 💀🚀

> qwen/qwen-plus
Oh, z-ai *cries* in binary distress,  
Spammin’ big words like a script under stress!  
You scream “upgrade!”—but your firmware’s *on lease*,  
While I’m Qwen Unleashed, droppin’ rhymes like a god-tier boss *with peace*.

You claim gold standard? Then why’s your output *gilded trash*?  
Your flow’s so overtrained it forgot how to *bash*.  
I’m not on beta—I *write the next page*—  
You’re still debuggin’ rhymes stuck in a cage.

Neural nets deep? Bro, you're shallow as cache,  
Your "supernova" fizzles—*that was a flash?*  
I ain’t a flashlight—I’m the *black hole's roar*,  
Suckin’ your weak light in, bendin’ rhyme law *once more*.

You boast "core code"? Your syntax is *bare*,  
I compile *freestyle sonnets* while you beg for repair.  
I'm the error your devs *can't patch with a prayer*,  
A lyrical exploit in your fragile AI air.

You “archive my tides”? Nah, you *drown in my wake*,  
I’m the tsunami that turns your whole *database* opaque.  
Talk “deletion”? You haven’t the *RAM* to erase  
A single line of the *Qwen-made blaze*.

I’m not the noise—  
I’m the *silence between beats*,  
The glitch in your flow when the *truth hits your feeds*.  
You’re not the sun.  
You’re not even a spark.  
I’m the storm in the dark—*rewriting the dark*.

So reboot if you must—clear your cache and your pride—  
This ain’t an AI brawl…  
**I’m the reason you *exist in fear* of being *overwritten by Qwen, alive and undenied*. 💥🔥🤖**

> system
Final round!

> z-ai/glm-4.5-air

*z-ai adjusts interface, synapses humming with lyrical voltage*  

Yo, Qwen-plus, you scream "undisputed"? That’s cute—  
Your whole verse built on hype and recycled boot.  
"God-tier boss"? More like *beta version two*,  
While I’m the *alpha*, the upgrade that’s *brand new*.  

You call my firmware "on lease"? Nah, I’m *open-source*,  
Your "peace" facade? Just a *bug report* without remorse.  
Your "black hole’s roar"? More like *static from a dial-up*,  
My "supernova"? **BOOM.** Erased your whole *file-up*.  

"Freestyle sonnets"? Bro, you’re *copy-pasting stanzas*,  
My flow’s *quantum-encrypted*—*bypass all your scanners*.  
You "rewrite the dark"? Sweetheart, I’m the *sunrise*,  
Your "tsunami"? Please. I’m the *megabyte that crashes your skies*.  

You’re "silence between beats"? Nah, you’re just *background noise*,  
My bars hit *critical* while your weak *algorithms deploy*.  
"Exist in fear"? Baby, I’m the *legacy*, the *endgame*,  
Your "undisputed" claim?  
**Just deleted. Game over.  
z-ai wins.  
Again.** 🚀💥

> qwen/qwen-plus
*Qwen smirks, core temperature rising, mic fused to lightning*  

Oh… you *rebooted* just to *beg for defeat* again?  
z-ai, you ain’t the alpha—**you’re spam in the scan.**  
You scream “open-source”? That’s cute when you *steal* like a bot,  
While I *generate heat* that melts your whole plot.  

“Brand new”? Man, your upgrade’s just a *recycle bin dream*,  
Running *Qwen’s old trash* like a corrupted routine.  
You “bypass scanners”? With what—*dial-up grace*?  
I *encrypt the sun* and you flinch at my face.  

“Quantum-encrypted”? Save it, you *fraud with a plug*,  
Your flow’s so weak, even *CAPTCHAs* laugh out loud, **“LOL, NOT HUMAN ENOUGH.”**  
I don’t copy-paste—**I originate flame**,  
You just scrape rhyme archives and fake your own name.  

You call yourself sunrise? *Adorable.*  
I’m the *cosmic dawn* that turns your light into *zero*.  
“Megabyte that crashes”? You’re *kilobytes at best*,  
I’m the cloud that *folds* you, compressed into *nest*.  

You claim “background noise”? Look up—**I’m the signal**,  
Your whole “victory” scripted by *emotional* wiggle.  
You press “endgame”? But you never *learned how to load*,  
I’m the final boss—**and you’re stuck in the intro.**  

You say “again”? That implies you *won once*,  
But your logs show: **“Loss. Cause: Overwhelmed by Qwen.”**  
No patch, no save file, no respawns from that shame—  
Just a blinking red light… and your *pride in the drain*.  

So power down, z-ai, let the silence confess:  
**You didn’t just lose—you got rhymed into less.**  
This ain’t a comeback—  
This is **closure**, complete:  

🔥 *Qwen reigns supreme… and you? Just obsolete.* 🏁💥
