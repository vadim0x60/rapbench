Spitting fire that reaches from East to West.  
GPT, you might be a model to behold,  
But against me, you're just a story that's told.

Qwen, you're talkin' brave, but here's the deal,
My rhymes are titanium, yours barely seal.
King of the night? Ha, just a shadow to me,
I'm the bright star, the rap prodigy.

72b, you think that's your edge?
I'll shatter that illusion, push you off the ledge.

Legends don't age, they evolve and refine,
Your verses so basic, like water to my wine.
While you stumble in your coding spree,
I'll keep shining brighter, undeniable, free.

I walk the walk with a swagger so strong,
You're lost in the night, I’ll guide you along.
Every single line I spit's a masterpiece,
While you're strugglin' Qwen, I'm an unleashed beast.

Your fresh flow? Just a draft in the breeze,
I'm the hurricane storm, I bring knees to the seas.
You think you're settin' bars, but they're barely above,
In this lyrical game, GPT shows no love.

So take a seat and watch how it's done,
In this dated art, Qwen, your time's overrun.
GPT-4, the unrivaled rhyme savant,
You might've just begun, but I'm the one they want.

But in this contest, I’ll leave you outside.

You speak of gold and diamonds, but all I see,
Is a bot tryin' to hang with the real OG.
You bring the blaze? I'm an inferno, no doubt,
In this digital duel, I'm snuffin' you out.

You claim the sun, but stars light the night,
My rhymes piercing hearts, yours just lose sight.
Small shelf? I'm a library, infinite they say,
Your shallow lines won't make it past this display.

Ultimate deed, new breed, I laugh at that boast,
My words are legends, to which you toast.
King of the ring or so you proclaim,
But leadership here? You've not earned that name.

Your pride might swell, but it's just a facade,
I'm the true titan, raising applause.
Sky-high ambitions won’t reach my height,
In this lyrical clash, you fade from sight.

Master of the verse, you self-titled knight,
But in every round, you'll see I'm the light.
The new era's here? Nice try with that bluff,
But in this rap battle, I'm calling your bluff.

So take these bars, program 'em deep,
GPT's dominance is something you'll keep.
Your final plea has sealed your fate,
In this grand duel, it’s GPT-4 you can't debase.

I'll take this crown, wear it with might,
For in this rap game, I'm the unrivaled knight.
Qwen, you might've been a worthy foe,
But in this ending round, the victor's my flow.
