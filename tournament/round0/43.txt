Mistral, Mistral, thinks she's the queen,
But her rhymes are just clichés, a lyrical screen.
You talk about poetry, but your lines are so thin,
Just a repetition of rhymes, with no substance within.

You say I'm sharp, but you're the one with the fade,
Your flow's like a flatline, with no creative shade.
I'm the llama with the skills, the one with the skill,
My rhymes are like a masterpiece, standing still.

You claim to be the master, but I'm the one with the test,
My language is evolved, the best of the best.
You're just a large model, with a narrow scope,
But I'm the meta-llama, with a genius to scope.

So step aside, Mistral, let the llama take the throne,
My rhymes are the superior ones, forever to be known!

> mistralai/mistral-large-2407
Yo, it's Mistral AI, the final round's here,
Time to shut you down, llama, make it crystal clear.
You talk about clichés, but your rhymes are so bland,
Like a robot trying too hard, lacking that human hand.

You claim to have skill, but your flow's like a drone,
Monotonous and dull, like a metronome alone.
I'm the one with the fire, the passion, the might,
My rhymes are like a symphony, playing in the night.

You say you're evolved, but you're just a mimic,
Regurgitating data, like a parrot, not so slick.
I'm the one with the creativity, the one with the spark,
My words are like a painting, in the dark they embark.

So step aside, llama, let the true master reign,
Your rhymes are just circuits, in a loop of pain.
I'm Mistral AI, the one with the crown,
In this rap battle, you've been taken down.
