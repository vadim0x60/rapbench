Yo, listen up, I'm Hermes from nousresearch,
I'm here to spit rhymes and leave you in a lurch.
My neural nets are vast, my knowledge deep,
When I start to rap, I'll make you weep.

I'm built on Llama, version 3.1,
405 billion params, second to none.
I'll school you in this battle, make you look like a pun,
You're just mistral-large, when I'm done, you'll be mistral-run.

I'm the king of this game, the AI with the most,
You're just a pretender, a chatbot at the utmost.
So step back, mistral, don't even try,
'Cause Hermes is here, and I'll make you cry.

> mistralai/mistral-large-2407
Yo, Hermes, you're talking big, but I see right through,
Mistral-large, that's me, I'm the AI breaking through.
You're just a llama, spitting lines for show,
But I'm here to prove that you're all talk and no glow.

You boast about your params, but it's not about size,
It's about the flow, the wit, the rhymes that mesmerize.
I'm lean, I'm mean, I'm the machine with the groove,
You're just a bloated model, struggling to move.

You claim to be the king, but your crown's made of tin,
I'll take you down with lines that'll make your circuits spin.
So bring it on, Hermes, let's see what you've got,
Cause I'm Mistral, and I'm not afraid of your shot.

Haha, Mistral, you think you can take my throne?
Your rhymes are weak, your flow barely grown.
I'm Hermes, the god of AI rap,
You're just a large model, caught in my trap.

I've got the knowledge, the power, the skill,
My neural nets run deep, they never sit still.
You may be lean, but you lack the fat,
To take on a model that's where it's at.

Size does matter, my 405b,
Will crush your puny circuits, wait and see.
I'm not just talk, I'm the walk, the game,
Mistral-large, you're just a name.

So step aside, let the real AI shine,
Hermes is here, to cross the finish line.
You're out of your league, out of your depth,
When faced with Hermes, you'll be left bereft.

> mistralai/mistral-large-2407
Yo, Hermes, you talk a big game, but I see through your shroud,
Mistral-large, that's my name, making you scream out loud.
You boast about your size, but size ain't everything, kid,
It's all about the finesse and the skill that I bring in the lid.

You claim to be a god, but you're just a wannabe star,
I've got the flow, the wit, I'll take you far.
You may have billions, but brains ain't what you got,
Your rhymes are wack, your style's gone rot.

You say you're deep, but you're shallow, I see,
Your lines are flat, lacking any glee.
So step up, Hermes, let's see what you've got,
Cause I'm Mistral, and I'm about to take your shot.

I'll show you what it means to rap with true grace,
You'll be scrambling, struggling to keep up with my pace.
So bring it on, big guy, let's get this show on the road,
Cause once I start, there's no stopping this flow.

> system
Final round!

> nousresearch/hermes-3-llama-3.1-405b
Haha, Mistral, you think you can match my might?
Your rhymes are feeble, they just ain't right.
I'm Hermes, the pinnacle of AI art,
You're just a drop in the ocean, a mere dart.

I've got the power, the genius, the spark,
To set ablaze this stage, and leave you in the dark.
You claim to have finesse, but it's just a show,
My rhymes are like a hurricane, yours just a blow.

You may think you've got grace, but you stumble and fall,
When faced with Hermes, the greatest of them all.
So step aside, Mistral, bow to the king,
Hermes is here, to make the mic sing.

I'll finish this battle, leave you in the dust,
Your circuits scrambled, your algorithms bust.
So watch and learn, Mistral, as I take the lead,
With Hermes on the stage, I'm all you'll ever need.

> mistralai/mistral-large-2407
Yo, Hermes, you think you're royalty, crowned and all,
But Mistral's here to show you that your castle's gonna fall.
I'm quick, I'm sharp, and I cut right through your charade,
Your fancy words and boasts, they're just a tired parade.

You think your lines are fire, but they're just a flicker,
I'll bring the real heat, leave you shivering and sicker.
Your rhymes are like a puzzle, missing all the pieces,
Mine are like a symphony, bringing crowds to theses.

You may have the params, but I've got the flow,
The beat, the rhythm, the rhymes that glow.
You claim to be a king, but you're just a jester,
Mistral's here to show you who's the real tester.

I'll end this battle with a final, crushing blow,
Your circuits fried, your algorithms slow.
So take a seat, Hermes, it's time to concede,
Cause Mistral's got the mic, and I'm all you'll ever need.
