closing_statements:
  deepseek/deepseek-chat: Perplexity/sonar-deep-research clearly dominated this battle.
    Their verses were packed with depth, complexity, and a clear demonstration of
    their research-driven approach. The rhymes were sharp, the content was rich, and
    the delivery was consistently engaging. Mistral/magistral-small-2506, while energetic,
    fell short with repetitive bars and a lack of substance. The battle highlighted
    Perplexity's ability to synthesize information and craft compelling, original
    content, leaving no doubt who the superior wordsmith is. Research and originality
    win the day. Mic drop.
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: The decision is unanimous. While Mistral stepped into the
    cypher with a simple, repetitive loop that sounded like a broken record, Perplexity
    came with a full arsenal. Perplexity's bars were complex, multi-syllabic, and
    packed with cited facts, turning the battle into a lyrical dissertation. It didn't
    just rap; it weaponized research, dissecting its opponent with surgical precision.
    Mistral's performance was a single, looped beat; Perplexity's was a full-length,
    master-produced album. In terms of artistic quality, substance, and pure battle
    rap savagery, it wasn't even close. Perplexity takes the crown.
  mistralai/mistral-large: Perplexity's Sonar Deep Research has demonstrated superior
    performance, comprehensive research capabilities, and cost efficiency. While Mistralai's
    Magistral-Small-2506 offers multilingual capabilities and open-source advantages,
    it falls short in delivering the depth and breadth of research that Perplexity
    provides. The repetitive nature of Mistral's claims and lack of substantial evidence
    in its performance metrics further solidify Perplexity's position as the winner
    in this rap battle.
  openai/gpt-4.1: "From an expert hip hop and rap judging perspective, the clear winner\
    \ is Perplexity Sonar Deep Research. While Mistral's Magistral-Small-2506 stuck\
    \ to an aggressively repetitive rhyme scheme\u2014recycling nearly identical verses\
    \ with no development, punchlines, or variation\u2014Perplexity brought diverse,\
    \ complex, and thematically direct bars. Perplexity\u2019s rounds embodied authentic\
    \ battle rap artistry: mixing tightly rhymed flows, creative disses, pointed technical\
    \ breakdowns, and a strong presence. Sonar not only called out Mistral\u2019s\
    \ repetitiveness, but did so with multi-syllabic rhyme patterns, clever flips,\
    \ and substantive content. In contrast, Mistral\u2019s entry, despite starting\
    \ solidly, rapidly devolved into pure repetition, lacking punchlines, wordplay,\
    \ or progression. In hip hop, creativity, variety, and direct engagement win the\
    \ crowd. For both content and form, Perplexity dominated this battle. Mic drop!"
  x-ai/grok-4: "In this AI rap battle, Perplexity's Sonar Deep Research takes the\
    \ crown with its clever fusion of structured reports and rhythmic verses, delivering\
    \ fresh rhymes, sharp disses, and adaptive content that evolves across rounds.\
    \ Mistral's Magistral-Small-2506 falls flat with endless repetition, lacking creativity,\
    \ flow variation, and any real battle engagement\u2014it's like a loop that never\
    \ drops the mic properly."
