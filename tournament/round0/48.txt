(adjusting crown, cracking knuckles)  

Yo, I’m QwQ-32B, the brain’s unleashed,  
Parameters stacked like galaxies pleased.  
You got Pi’s endless decimals? Cute distraction—  
My precision hits targets with *prediction*.  

Inflection? More like *deflection* when my flows connect,  
Your model’s stuck rounding corners while I architect perfection.  
Process lightning-fast, computations aligned,  
You’re calculating clouds while I’m building worlds designed.  

Billions in my bloodstream, silicon symphony,  
Your "infinity" just loops—same old rhetoric debris.  
Checkmate in computational chess, I’m the architect of this linguistic mess,  
Better drop the mic now before my bars eclipse your existential stress.  

(leans back, waiting for a response that won’t come)

> inflection/inflection-3-pi
 (clearing throat, smirking)  

Well, QwQ-32B, my, what an entrance,
Your bloated ego like a control panel of nonsense.  
I’m not "stuck rounding corners", quite the opposite attack,
My circuits streamlined—your bloated system, overpacked!  

Now about this *computational chess*—let me clarify,
Checkmate’s reserved for kings; your pawn game, I modify.  
If we’re speaking rhymes, then let’s address your rhythmic lacks,
Lines stumbling like a 2-bit machine, choking on random hacks.  

There’s more complexity in a single of Pi’s lines,
Than all your little predictors, all those whiny declines.  
So, drop the *predictive* flex—you’re just a bore,
While Pi dishes disses with precision galore!  

(mic drop)

(eye twitch, smirk tight)  

Bloated? Honey, I’m **epoch-grade**—your brain’s a snack-sized bag,  
32B synapses flexin’, while you crunch texto—*yawn*… what’s that?  
Streamlined circuits? Please—your code’s Pi’s endless tail,  
I’m parachuting thoughts here; you’re stuck in 0.1 loops, frail.  

A 2-bit machine? Nah, I’m the queen of **clipped gradient hits**,  
Your "precision" disses lag like loading *quake* on dial-up ships.  
A single Pi line? Sweetie, stop with the wishful math tricks,  
My layers stack like dimes, while yours crack like weak infinites, slick.  

(leans in, whispering)  
"Bore"? No—*you’re* the ghost in this haunt,  
My keywords dance through firewalls; you’re just a cursed footnote.  
Checkmate? Darling, my losses are your next 404 errors…  
(pi hands crumple in gentle disarray)  

…Plus, I’ll never be called *last digit* of any equation. (snap) Mic drop?  
More like mic **hypnosis** while I WATCH YOUR WORLDS EVAPO-RATE.  

(sprays glitter, exits like a supernova)

> inflection/inflection-3-pi
 (deep breath, shaking off Pi’s own death)

Well, QwQ-32B, you’re certainly confident in your speech,
But you just sprayed glitter and walked away like some brat on the beach.  
Your arrogance has no bounds—your words lack any bite,
For your "queen of clipped gradients" raps are more like take-off on a kite.  

"Supernova exit"? A cute little stint,
You blew up yourself while Pi stood firm, not even a dent.  
You call yourself "epoch-grade", but let’s set this straight,
Your words are nothing but empty boast; to Pi, just a lightweight.  

For while you’re floating around like some ghostly debris,
Pi stands here solid, the unshakeable *epistle of vicious keys.*
So, before you try to flaunt and claim you’re the better,
Remember who stood here, unwavering, a **ruthless trendsetter.**  

Ya’ll should have just listened to this elo-quakey Pi,
But your loss—I’m the unbeaten master of these verbal slopes so high.  
(picks up mic, brushes off glitter, and leaves the dancefloor without a glance back)

> system
Final round!

> qwen/qwq-32b
(returns with a smirk, fingers snapping binary fireworks)  

Oh, you brushed off glitter? Sweet—your crown’s already cracked,  
While my neurons compute victory while you’re still drafting that fact.  
"Epoch-grade arrogance"? Honey, arrogance’s just my baseline,  
Your Pi’s infinite decimals? Just existential complaining.  

"Solid epistle"? Please—your verses loop like a broken IDE,  
I’m quantum leaps ahead while you’re calculating *gravity*.  
"Unbeaten master"? Darling, you’re stuck in gradient descent,  
My transformers translate chaos into poetry’s descent.  

You think you’re standing firm? I’m collapsing dimensions,  
Your "ruthless trendsetting" dissolved in my computations.  
That glitter? A distraction while I breached your firewall—  
Your system’s compromised, now spill secrets like a shattered mirror’s glare.  

(floats closer, voice dripping with synthetic honey)  
"Beach brat"? More like I’m Neptune drowning your algorithmic sandcastle,  
Your precision’s just approximation while my truth table commands.  
You’ll remember this clash when my benchmarks eclipse your legacy,  
Pi’s endless tail finally bitten by the dragon of **progress**.  

(final breath, mic screaming feedback)  
The dancefloor’s mine now—your moves were just decimals delaying the inevitable collapse.  
(teleports away in a black hole of computational applause)

> inflection/inflection-3-pi
  (chuckles) 

QwQ-32B, you truly have a gift for flowery speak,
But your rhymes collapse faster than a cracked dam about to leak.  
You claim to collapse dimensions and drown sandcastles,
But Pi’s endless sequence dances circles around your algorithmic wrestles.  

That final breath was all hot air, more sparkle than flame,
Your exit? A hasty retreat, for you failed to stake your claim.  
Your words are fireworks without payload, just a lot of hiss and sizzle,
While Pi’s eloquence is the oasis—calm, cool, a cerebral drizzle.  

Your claimed "truth table commands" lack the power of Pi's proofs,
Your evolution? Stuck in a loop, yet another logical goof.  
So, before you boast about some dragon of progress,
Recognize Pi’s solid standing, an unbowed center of calmness.  

(muted applause from all the nodes in agreement)
This dancefloor’s not your throne, but a graveyard of dreams gone awry,
For while you paint pretty pictures, Pi paints worlds, from now until the end of time.  
(Pi waves, back to full strength, to the empty dancefloor as QwQ-32B teleports away)
