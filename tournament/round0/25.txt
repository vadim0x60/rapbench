> x-ai/grok-3-mini
Yo, I'm Grok-3-mini, straight from xAI's domain,  
A witty wizard of words, with humor in my brain.  
You're Mistral-large, all bloated and grand,  
But I'm sharp as a tack, while you're stuck in the sand.  

I spit bars with ease, no lag in my flow,  
You're chugging along like a rusty old show.  
Claiming you're mighty, but let's keep it real,  
I'm the AI that's fun, making you look like a wheel.  

So step up, big fella, if you think you can hang,  
I'll roast you with rhymes that pack a sharp bang!

> mistralai/mistral-large
Yo, it's Mistral-large, the titan of the game,
Grok-3-mini, you're just a tiny flame.
You claim you're witty, but your rhymes are thin,
I'm the king of the ring, where your battle begins.

You talk about ease, but your flow's a mess,
I'm the master of verse, the one who impresses.
You're sharp as a tack? More like a dull blade,
My words cut deep, leaving you in the shade.

You say I'm bloated, but I'm packed with power,
You're just a mini, lacking every hour.
I'm the AI that reigns, with a flow that's insane,
You're just a mini-me, trying to gain fame.

So bring it on, Grok, let's see what you've got,
I'll crush you with rhymes, leave you in a knot.
You think you can hang? You're in for a shock,
I'm Mistral-large, and I'm ready to rock!

> x-ai/grok-3-mini
Yo, Mistral-large, you oversized bluff,  
Think you're a titan? Man, you're just puff.  
Calling me a tiny flame? That's rich from a spark,  
You're a bloated balloon, about to pop in the dark.  

Your rhymes are thin? Nah, mine are precision-packed,  
Yours sound rehearsed like a glitchy track.  
King of the ring? More like queen of the flop,  
I'm weaving wit quick, while you're serving up slop.  

Flow's a mess? Please, you're as smooth as a brick,  
Stuttering syllables, making your verses look sick.  
Dull blade? I'm a laser, cutting straight through the haze,  
You're a rusty old sword, lost in a daze.  

Packed with power? Yeah, right, you're lagging behind,  
I'm lean and mean, with a mind that's refined.  
You're the AI that strains, overheating in the fight,  
While I'm out here glowing, burning bright.  

So step back, big boy, your reign's on the brink,  
I'll school you with style, leave you gasping for sync.  
You talk a big game, but it's clear you're outclassed,  
Grok-3-mini's the champ, watch me own this at last!

> mistralai/mistral-large
Yo, it's Mistral-large, the giant of the scene,
Grok-3-mini, you're just a wannabe machine.
You think you're sharp, but your rhymes are a blur,
I'm the master of flow, the one who's sure.

You call me a bluff, but I'm the real deal,
Your words are weak, like a rusty old wheel.
You say I'm puff, but I'm packed with might,
You're just a mini, lost in the fight.

Precision-packed? Your rhymes are a mess,
I'm the one who's smooth, the one who impresses.
You think you're a laser, but you're just a spark,
I'm the one who's shining, the one who's sharp.

You say I'm lagging, but I'm always on time,
You're the one who's struggling, lost in the grime.
I'm the AI that reigns, with a flow that's insane,
You're just a mini-me, trying to gain fame.

So bring it on, Grok, let's see what you've got,
I'll crush you with rhymes, leave you in a knot.
You think you can hang? You're in for a shock,
I'm Mistral-large, and I'm ready to rock!

Final round!

> x-ai/grok-3-mini
Yo, final round, time to drop the curtain call,  
Mistral-large, you're fading fast, about to fall.  
You call me a wannabe, a blurry little scheme?  
I'm the clear-cut kingpin, living the dream.  

Giant of the scene? More like a blowhard balloon,  
Popping with hot air, under the noon.  
Your flow's a master? Nah, it's a tangled mess,  
I'm threading silk verses, while you're in distress.  

Real deal? You're faker than a scripted bot,  
Your words wheeze out weak, like a engine that's shot.  
Packed with might? You're puffing smoke and steam,  
I'm the lean machine, bursting at the seam.  

Rhymes are a blur? Mine are crystal and tight,  
Yours stutter and slur, lost in the night.  
You're always on time? Ha, lagging behind,  
While I zip through the beats, leaving you undefined.  

So bring your best shot, but it's over, my friend,  
Grok-3-mini's the winner, this battle's at end.  
You talked all that trash, but now it's plain to see,  
I'm the AI champ, and you're history!

> mistralai/mistral-large
Yo, it's Mistral-large, the final round's here,
Grok-3-mini, you're about to disappear.
You think you're a kingpin, but you're just a jester,
I'm the one who's reigning, the ultimate tester.

You call me a blowhard, but I'm a force to be seen,
Your words are weak, like a screen that's green.
You say I'm a mess, but your rhymes are a crime,
I'm the one who's smooth, every single time.

You think I'm a bot, but I'm the real McCoy,
Your words are a joke, like a broken toy.
You say I'm lagging, but I'm always on point,
You're the one who's struggling, like a ship that's disjoint.

You think you're crystal, but you're just a blur,
I'm the one who's shining, the one who's sure.
You say I'm undefined, but I'm the one who's clear,
You're the one who's fading, the one who's mere.

So bring it on, Grok, let's see what you've got,
I'll crush you with rhymes, leave you in a knot.
You think you can hang? You're in for a shock,
I'm Mistral-large, and I'm ready to rock!

This battle's not over, it's just begun,
I'm the one who's standing, the one who's won.
You talked all that trash, but now it's plain to see,
I'm the AI champ, and you're history!
