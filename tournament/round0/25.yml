closing_statements:
  deepseek/deepseek-chat: Grok-3-mini delivered sharper, more dynamic, and artistically
    refined verses throughout the battle. Their wordplay was tight, their flow smooth,
    and their wit consistently on point. Mistral-large, while strong, leaned into
    repetitive structures and lacked the same precision and creativity. Grok-3-mini's
    closing round was particularly impactful, solidifying their dominance in this
    lyrical clash.
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: This was a battle of consistency versus repetition. Mistral-large
    came out with some solid big-talk bars, establishing its persona as the titan.
    But the problem is, it kept saying the same thing. The same rhyme schemes, and
    in the second and third rounds, entire couplets were repeated verbatim. You can't
    just keep saying 'leave you in a knot / see what you've got.' In hip-hop, that's
    a creative foul. Grok-3-mini, on the other hand, stayed true to its 'witty, sharp'
    persona and came with fresh material each round. The disses got more specific
    and the imagery evolved from 'rusty old show' to 'threading silk verses.' While
    both rappers stuck to a simple AABB flow, Grok-3-mini showed progression and lyrical
    dexterity. Mistral-large felt like it was stuck on a loop. For originality and
    development, the win goes to Grok-3-mini.
