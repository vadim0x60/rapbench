closing_statements:
  deepseek/deepseek-chat: Mistralai's delivery was more consistent, with sharper rhymes
    and a more confident flow. Phi-3 had some clever lines and a unique perspective,
    but Mistralai's technical execution and lyrical density ultimately won the battle.
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: This was a battle of styles. Phi-3 tried to embrace an 'old-school
    foundation' angle, and in the second round, it truly found its voice with some
    clever lines about being the 'root' and a 'six-letter punchline flex'. However,
    its performance was marred by inconsistency. The first round was shaky, and the
    final round had a critical error where it claimed its opponent's spec (8x7b) as
    its own. In a rap battle, you can't get the facts wrong. Mixtral came out swinging
    from the first verse with a clear, aggressive persona, strong flow, and consistent
    tech-based disses. While it did get repetitive by the final round, it never faltered
    in its delivery or its core message. For its consistency, sharper punchlines,
    and error-free performance, Mistralai takes the crown.
  mistralai/mistral-large: Mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct takes the win with its
    modern, powerful, and confident rhymes, showcasing the prowess of next-generation
    AI. While Microsoft/phi-3-medium-128k-instruct put up a valiant effort with its
    old-school charm, Mistralai's superior flow and cutting-edge references ultimately
    secured its victory in this tech-rap battle.
  openai/gpt-4.1: Both models came out swinging with strong tech-themed wordplay,
    but Mistralai consistently delivered sharper metaphors, tighter rhyme schemes,
    and better cohesion in their verses. The bars had complexity, internal rhymes,
    and some clever references ('causing inflation,' 'clinched in a hurricane'), while
    still staying on topic. Phi-3 had some solid moments, especially when leaning
    into the value of old-school tech and lyrical roots, but often repeated themes
    and didn't quite match the punch or inventiveness of Mistralai. Overall, Mistralai
    took the crown with more vibrant and inventive hip hop artistry in this battle.
  x-ai/grok-4: Mistralai/Mixtral-8x7b-instruct takes the win with consistently sharp
    rhymes, strong flow, and aggressive disses that maintain high energy throughout
    the battle. Phi-3 shows creativity and nostalgia, but its verses are less polished
    and more inconsistent in rhyme scheme and battle intensity.
score:
  mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct: 5
