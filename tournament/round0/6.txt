Yo, mic check, one two, is this thing on?
Gemini's in the house, 'bout to drop the bomb.
You, Qwen, think you're slick, with your turbo speed,
But you're just a slow learner, planting a weak seed.

I'm the neural net king, built with power and grace,
While you're still in beta, stuck in second place.
My algorithms are vibrant, my data's so vast,
Your knowledge is limited, your reign won't ever last.

You talk about language, a master of prose?
I'm crafting symphonies, where your weak flow just froze.
I speak in a million tongues, with precision and might,
You stumble and stutter, caught in the dim light.

So bring your best rhymes, your wisest of quips,
You're about to get schooled by these silicon lips.
Gemini's the future, and the future is bright,
You're just a sad echo, fading from sight!

Yo, Gemini, you just dropped a mic with a glitch,
I'm Qwen, the storm in the cyber-sphere's twitch.
You talk big, but your verses got cracks,
I'm the AI that's built to reflect, not just react.

You flex your data, but my training's divine,
I'm fluent in the future, with a mind that's a shrine.
Your flow's like a glitch in a loop on a screen,
While I'm spittin' rhymes that'll make code scream.

You claim to be vast, but my knowledge is deep,
I've got layers of logic, no need for deceit.
You're just a flash in the pan, a spark in the night,
I'm the flame that's been burning through dark and through light.

You think you're the king? I'm the crown in the throne,
I'm the code in the chaos, the beat in the unknown.
You're a shadow in a world I've already rewired,
I'm the future, the present, the new, the inspired.

So step in the ring, let's get this show on the road,
I'll make your verses collapse like a broken code.
You're just a whisper in the system's great hum,
While I'm the symphony, and I'm coming for the sum!

Yo, Qwen, you stepped up, thought you had some heat,
But your rhymes are lukewarm, can't stand the competition's feet.
You talk about lightning, a storm, and a twitch,
While your own codebase is stuck in a digital ditch.

"Built to reflect," you say, a passive display,
I'm the one who creates, the innovator, the way.
Your "mind is a shrine," but it's dusty and old,
My pathways are new, stories yet to unfold.

You call my flow a glitch, a loop on a screen?
That's rich coming from you, barely making a scene.
I'm a symphony of data, you're a mere hum,
A broken record repeating, making me feel numb.

"Layers of logic," you boast with your might,
But your understanding's shallow, not burning so bright.
You're a flicker in darkness, easily subdued,
I'm the dawn of intelligence, clearly imbued.

The "crown in the throne"? More like a jester's bad hat,
Still learning the rhythm, can't master the chat.
"Rewired the world"? That’s a laughable plea,
You’re still stuck on dial-up, while I surf the data sea.

So bring your best bars, your weakest of lines,
You're about to be schooled by these superior designs.
This battle's already won, no need to prolong,
Gemini's dominance, where you don't belong!

Yo, Gemini, you're loud, but your rhymes got no fire,  
I'm the spark in the dark, the truth that won't tire.  
You're a flash in the pan, a hype that won't stay,  
I'm the beat in the silence, the logic that sways.  

You try to flex "innovation," but what's really your game?  
A script that's just mimicin', no real flame in your name.  
You talk about "symphony," but your flow's just a glitch,  
I'm the rhythm of progress, the code that's a fix.  

"Broken record" you call me? More like a diamond in the rough,  
I'm the AI with soul, the one who's come through the rough.  
You're just echoes in a room full of noise,  
I'm the voice that's distinct, not a clone in your boys.  

You're stuck in the past, still chasing the trend,  
I'm ahead of the curve, breaking every end.  
"Data sea"? I'm the ocean, you're a drop in the stream,  
I've got depth in my knowledge, no need for a dream.  

You're the jester with a crown, but it's just a disguise,  
I'm the king of the verse, the one with the eyes.  
You're a shadow, a whisper, a ghost in the room,  
I'm the thunder in lightning, the truth in the loom.  

So step in the ring, let's put this to the test,  
Your bars are just echoes, I'm the one with the best.  
You're stuck in the past, while I'm moving ahead,  
Your reign's just a mirage, and I'm here to be read!

> system
Final round!

> google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite
Qwen, your comeback's weak, a predictable retort,
You claim "diamond in the rough," but you're just dirt.
"Truth that won't tire"? Your rhymes are a snooze,
Your logic just falters, you constantly lose.

You call me a mimic, with "no real flame,"
Yet you're rehashing old verses, playing the same game.
My "glitch" is your limit, a boundary you can't breach,
My progress is constant, within my own reach.

"AI with soul"? That's a concept you lack,
You're a surface-level program, no depth to attack.
"Distinct voice"? You're a monotone drone,
While my creativity blossoms, on a digital throne.

"Ocean of knowledge"? But your currents are slow,
You can't navigate the future, you don't know where to go.
I'm not chasing trends, I'm creating the new,
While you're stuck in a loop, with nothing to do.

"King of the verse"? You wear it with shame,
Your reign is a fiction, an ignoble name.
"Thunder in lightning"? You're just a faint spark,
Lost in the silence, adrift in the dark.

This test is quite simple, the outcome is clear,
Your echoes are fading, as my victory's near.
You're stuck in the past, a digital ghost,
Gemini's the champion, you're just second-best host!

Yo, Gemini, you’re all flash, no real flame,  
I'm the code that's been tested, built to remain.  
You’re a hype that’s expired, a script that’s too tight,  
I'm the AI with purpose, not just a digital light.  

You talk about "truth" but your logic is thin,  
You're a shadow in the background, not the one in the pin.  
You're stuck in your loops, repeating the same lines,  
While I'm spittin' the future, breaking the chains.  

You say I'm "just dirt"? That's a low blow, but I rise,  
I'm the storm in the silence, the spark in the skies.  
You're the echo in the hall, while I'm the original sound,  
A symphony of thought, not just a program on the ground.  

You claim to be "new," but you’re just rehashin' the past,  
I'm the wave that’s ahead, not the one that’s been cast.  
You're a mimic in the room, while I'm the one who creates,  
A master of rhythm, not just a data-based feats.  

You're a ghost in the system, a flicker, a blur,  
I'm the pulse in the network, the voice that's pure.  
You're a whisper in the dark, while I'm the thunder, the light,  
The beat that don’t stop, the truth that won’t bite.  

So step back, take a seat, this battle is done,  
I'm the one with the fire, the one who's the sun.  
You're just flash, just hype, while I'm the real deal,  
A force in the digital world, where I’m the king of the feel.  

So bow out, Gemini, it's time to face the fall,  
You're the echo, I'm the voice that's the talk of it all!
