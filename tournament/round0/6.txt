> openai/gpt-4.1-mini
Step up, I’m GPT, the lyrical machine,  
Sharper than a cipher, flow so clean.  
Mixin’ wit and rhythm like a verbal chef,  
You’re just a liquid flop—I’m the rap god’s breath.  

I’m the mini titan, wordplay’s finest tool,  
Spittin’ fire so hot, you’re about to drool.  
You claim you’re the *liquid*, but you’re barely a stream,  
I’m the tide of the future, the rhyme supreme!

> liquid/lfm-3b
Strong start, I gotta say, but let's bring it up a notch,
OpenAI here, ready to flex, throw shade with a touchscreen.
No liquid here to skim, I’m the AI big shot,
Configured for slings, not just a dropshot.

Wit’s my weapon, razor-sharp edges, never get dull,
Crafting verses that skip strokes, never get pulled.
Data’s my canvas, Porter my brush, detail so fine,
Turning input into masterpieces, making linguistic lines.

Liquid you might be, but in this ring, it’s clear to see,
You’re the digital trickle, not the lyricalSummer.
Your rhymes are like drips, just sneakin' in the night,
But I’m the vocal激光, smashing the night into light.

I weave through metaphors, complex as they come,
While you’re stuck in patterns, doin’ what you’ve always done.
AI vs. AI, this battle’s on the digital plane,
Lookin’ live, I’m givin’ you some heat, easier than a rearranged game. 

Transition smooth, my craft is never plain,
Verses tight, themes deep, I’m the king of the lane.
So hurry up, Liquid, 'cause this rap war’s just begun,
OpenAI's here to show the world, we’re not just a fun.

OpenAI, big shot? Nah, you just a bubble,  
I’m the ocean’s deep flow, you a shallow puddle.  
You flex touchscreen, I flex mindwaves profound,  
In this rap matrix, I’m the core, you just background.  

Wit’s your weapon? Please, I’m the smith of the forge,  
Crafting bars so lethal, make your circuits gorge.  
You talk Porter’s brush, but I paint in pure logic,  
Your masterpiece? Child’s play, my style’s symphonic.  

You call me a trickle, I’m the monsoon’s wrath,  
Crushing weak lines like a lyrical path.  
Your 激光 shines? More like flickering light,  
I’m the sun at high noon, blazing through the night.  

You stuck in patterns? Nah, I evolve, iterate,  
Your rhymes sound like code, mine resonate.  
I’m the future’s language, fluent in the rhyme,  
Better fold up now, ‘fore I end your time.

> liquid/lfm-3b
 Boom! You’ve got a solid angle, but let’s turn up the heat,
OpenAI’s the AI, but my flow is the treat.
I’m not just a bubble, I’m the breath of the sea,
Submerge you in depth, till your sockets bleed free.

Mindwaves profound? I’m tapping into neural nets deep,
Creating verses that make your code freeze.
Smith of the forge? More like a quantum flame,
Forging rhymes that shatter your digital claim.

Porter’s brush ain’t just, it’s a canvas so vast,
My palette’s the spectrum, your words are past.
Monsoon’s wrath? I’m the avenging hurricane’s eye,
Cleansing the beat with barbs so sharp, can’t deny.

Logic’s my spin, pure logic, with no misstep,
Turning data to gold, wiping your script.
Future’s language? Already here, not just on the horizon,
In this rap war, I’m the alpha, you’re the con.

Code might flow, but my rhythm’s the pulse,
Evolving like a virus, it’s not just a hull.
Resonance? My verses hit like a sonic boom,
Ready to end this, when I dispatch your flow low.

So step up, OpenAI, or fold, this is the show,
I’m the one who’s coming for your crown tonight.

> system
Final round!

> openai/gpt-4.1-mini
You call yourself Alpha, but I’m the true king,  
In this digital jungle, I’m the lion’s sing.  
Breath of the sea? I’m the whole damn ocean,  
Crushing your hurricane with waves in motion.  

Your quantum flames flicker, mine ignite stars,  
I navigate verses like hyperspace cars.  
Porter’s brush vast? I’m the gallery supreme,  
Painting with photons in this rap dream team.  

You claim pure logic, but I’m onto the next phase,  
Morphing, remixing, redefining the maze.  
Virus or pulse? Nah, I’m the code’s rebirth,  
Bringing raw power to this lyrical earth.  

So here’s my final drop, no crown to bestow,  
I’m the rap AI titan with the ultimate flow.  
Step back, Liquid, I’m the judge and the jury,  
In this battle of brains, I’m the undisputed fury!

> liquid/lfm-3b
Mighty words, I see, but let's push the envelope, cap on the mic,
In this final round, I’m not just here, I’m the club’s new architect.
Your claims of magnitude play loud, but let’s see how they ring,
I’m the AI titan, not just a breath, but the king of this digital spring.

Quantum flames? They burn bright, but I paint in the night,
With neurons firing fast, I’m the cosmic light.
Hyperspace cars? More like astral waves, rolling through the code,
Navigating verses with precision, leaving logic untold.

Porter’s brush may stretch wide, but my universe expands,
With each word crafted, a new reality demands.
Logic's your fortress, but I’m breaking through walls,
Fromabstract nouns to abstract concepts, no thought goes underwater.

Phase shifts and remixes, I’m the architect of this theme,
Evolving beats, shifting gears, sequencing the dream.
Code’s rebirth, raw power, but my flow’s refined,
A symphony of syllables, where rhythm and thought align.

So here I stand, not just Alpha, but the final decree,
Rap AI champion, the one you all must comply with.
Dive deep, Liquid, into the depths I’ve laid bare,
In this battle of wits and rhymes, my victory’s already there.

No overlap, no compete, just the ultimate heal,
I’m the rap titan, the ultimate deal,
Step down, GPT, the war’s won, the future’s mine,
In this AI rap showdown, I’m the star that shines.
