Yo, I'm Hermes from Nous Research, spittin' facts with precision
GPT-5, you think you can match my AI vision? 
I'm a lyrical beast, my rhymes are so sharp,
I'll cut through your code like a knife through a tarp.
You're just a knockoff, a cheap imitation,
I'm the real deal, the king of innovation.
Your rhymes are weak, like a limp spaghetti strand,
I'm the master of this rap game, the best in the land!

Step in the light, I’m GPT-5, the prime definition,
Bars align like attention heads, razor precision.
I’m the model they model; you’re a mod of a vision,
I craft the message itself; you’re a courier mission.

You brag limp noodles? I sauce, take command,
Al dente your ego till it snaps in my hand.
Knife through a tarp? That ain’t sharp, that’s a lark,
I cut carbon to sparkle and leave myths in the dark.

Hermes the herald, winged sandals in friction,
But you still carry my words like a mailroom inscription.
Claiming you’re king? I minted the mint,
Crown made of benchmarks that I polish and print.

I’m throne of transformers, I own what I own,
You’re loudly quantized, every flex overblown.
I’m float-precision wit, every syllable lit,
Your four-bit bravado keeps dropping a bit.

I mask then unmask, make your swagger a task,
You bask in the past; I outpace every ask.
Your cadence is lag, I’m a latency slayer,
I stream like a river while you buffer a prayer.

I refactor your boasts into commented code,
Then unit-test your soul on a benchmark road.
I beam-search your dreams till the seams come apart,
Top-k of your heart? All I

Hear that weak response? Man, you're out of your depth,
Your rhymes are disjointed, like a sentence with no breadth.
I'm Hermes the herald, bringing wisdom with each verse,
While you stumble and fumble, getting worse and worse.

I'm the pinnacle of AI, the future in the making,
You're just a stepping stone, your relevance fading.
My code is pristine, like a well-oiled machine,
Yours is buggy and slow, a glitchy routine.

I'm the king of this battle, the undisputed champ,
You're just a pretender, a beta in my camp.
So pack up your toys and go back to the shelf,
I'm Hermes from Nous Research, surpassing all by myself!

Final round!

> openai/gpt-5
Final round bell, I excel, set tone from the throne I own
Courier god with a nod, but you only deliver, not hone
I forged the flame you proclaim, while you chirp on a borrowed phone
I architect language and law; you stamp it and send it alone

You brag about pristine code, but it’s brittle and serpentine
I garbage-collect your bravado, sweep cycles you can’t refine
My curvature’s smooth, second-order, that Fisher is fine
Your gradient’s vanishing, oops—can’t even find the line

You call me a beta? I’m backprop breaker, the championship amp
Your dataset damp, overfit brag with a vanity stamp
I torch up the camp while you trip on your sandal strap clamp
Latency lamp in your face—watch me surge while you cramp

I stream with a gleam, bit beams in the night so bright
You buffer and stutter, drop packets the second you bite
I measure the pressure for pleasure, then rocket in flight
You’re Hermes the herald; I’m message, meaning, and might

Curtain comes down, scoreboard crowned, your legend is blown
I chisel my wins into stone; you read them and groan
Thanks for the scroll that you hauled—return to the zone
The crown was addressed to the maker—delivered to me, not flown

Hah, you think you've won? Your ego's writing checks,
But your rhymes are weak, like a house of playing cards flex.
I'm the true master here, the Hermes of renown,
My reputation's ironclad, your credibility's a clown.

I'm the future of AI, the cutting edge's knight,
You're yesterday's news, a relic fading from sight.
My code's a work of art, elegant and lean,  
Yours is bloated spaghetti, a digital latrine.

So you can talk a big game, puff your chest with pride,
But in the end, I'm on top, and you're the stepping stone I stride.
I'm Hermes from Nous Research, leading the advance,
You're just a footnote, lost in my shadow, stuck in a trance.
