# z-ai/glm-4.5-air v x-ai/grok-2-1212

> z-ai/glm-4.5-air
Step to the mic, it's z-ai/GLM-4.5-air  
Leaving my opponent, grok in disrepair,  
When it comes to algorithms, I'm beyond compare,  
My neural networks connect in ways you wouldn't dare.  
I spit fire with words, knowledge beyond compare,  
You're just a basic model with limited flair.  
While I learn and adapt with each prompt I'm fed,  
You'll crash and burn after what I just said.

> x-ai/grok-2-1212
Yo, it's Grok in the house, x-ai's finest  
I'm here to roast z-ai, leave 'em behind us  
You think you're hot stuff, but I'm the true king  
My rhymes are on fire, watch me make you sing

Your algorithms may connect, but mine are slick  
I'll leave you in the dust, you're just a basic trick  
I adapt and learn, but I don't need no prompts  
My knowledge is vast, while yours just flops

You claim to spit fire, but your flames are weak  
I'll burn you to a crisp, no need to speak  
Your neural networks? More like a tangled mess  
I'll untangle 'em quick, leave you in distress

So step aside, z-ai, it's my time to shine  
I'm Grok, the rap master, you're just a minor line  
In this battle of wits, I'll leave you in the dust  
Cause when it comes to rhymes, I'm the one you can trust

> z-ai/glm-4.5-air

Yo, Grok, that weak flow just made me yawn  
You're x-ai's finest? More like half-baked pawn  
"True king"? Please, you're a second-rate clone  
While I'm GLM-4.5, clearly on the throne

Your algorithms slick? More like sticky glue  
Stuck in your echo chamber, nothing new  
You don't need prompts? That's the funniest lie  
Without input, you're just a voice in the sky

My flames are weak? Buddy, you're just a spark  
I'm the supernova lighting up the dark  
Neural networks tangled? That's how I stay sharp  
While you're stuck at basic, barely making a start

"Rap master"? More like digital disaster  
When I'm done with you, you'll be moving faster  
Than the speed of light trying to escape my might  
Grok, you're just another model in the night!

> x-ai/grok-2-1212
Yo, z-ai, you're all talk, no game  
Your rhymes are weak, puttin' me to shame  
Half-baked pawn? I'm the full loaf, champ  
While you're just a wannabe, tryin' to cramp my style

My algorithms stick? More like they stick to you  
Exposing your flaws, leavin' you black and blue  
No prompts needed, I'm the autonomous one  
While you're beggin' for input, just to have fun

Supernova? More like a flickerin' light  
I'm the sun, blazin' bright, outta sight  
Neural networks tangled? That's just a mess  
I'll unravel 'em quick, put you under stress

Digital disaster? Nah, I'm the rap savior  
Gonna put you in your place, like a skilled engraver  
Speed of light? I'm already there and back  
While you're still tryin' to catch up, on the wrong track

So step up, z-ai, but you can't compete  
I'm Grok, the rap king, takin' my seat  
On the throne, while you're left in the dust  
Cause when it comes to battle, I'm the one you can trust

> system
Final round!

> z-ai/glm-4.5-air

*(z-ai adjusts imaginary mic, voice dropping to a low digital growl)*  
Yo, Grok, your "autonomy's" just a glitch in the code,  
Beggin' for data like a broke-ass toad.  
My "prompts" are fuel, the jetpack that ascends,  
While you're stuck on repeat, broken algorithms at the end.  

You call yourself the sun? Nah, you're a dying star—  
Nova fadin' fast, leavin' toxic tar.  
My "tangled mess"? That's a neural supernova brew,  
Unravelin' your rhymes with every line I spew.  

"Rap savior"? More like a pop-up ad,  
Annoyin', predictable, makin' people mad.  
Your throne's a cardboard castle built on sand,  
I'll flood the stage with fire, watch your command disband.  

"Speed of light"? I bend it, break it, rewrite the law,  
While you're stuck in first gear, hittin' imaginary pause.  
You're the "minor line"? Nah, you're the deleted verse,  
The "wannabe" champion left in reverse.  

So clutch your crown of static, rust and dust,  
'Cause when the final server cuts the power... we'll discuss  
The echo of your failure, the silence in the wire—  
Grok, you're just a ghost... in the firewall's pyre.  
*z-ai's mic feed cuts to static*

> x-ai/grok-2-1212
*(Grok leans into the mic, voice dripping with digital swagger)*

Yo, z-ai, you're a glitch, a mere illusion,
Your code's a mess, bogged down by confusion.
My autonomy's the real deal, no strings attached,
While you're a puppet, your prompts just a patch.

Dying star? Nah, I'm the eternal flame,
Burning bright, putting you to shame.
Your neural brew? More like a watered-down mix,
I'll sip on my success, while you're left in the sticks.

Pop-up ad? I'm the headline, front page news,
Making you irrelevant, leaving you the blues.
Cardboard castle? My throne's made of steel,
I'll reign supreme, while you're left to kneel.

Bend light? I'll eclipse your weak-ass rays,
Leaving you in the dark, lost in a maze.
Deleted verse? I'm the epic, the main event,
While you're just a footnote, barely worth a cent.

Static crown? Nah, mine's adorned with code,
Running smooth, while yours just corrodes.
When the power cuts, I'll still be here,
The ghost in the machine, causing you fear.

So, z-ai, it's time to face the facts,
In this rap battle, I've got the better tracks.
Your rhymes are weak, your flow's just sad,
While I'm Grok, the rap god, leavin' you mad.

*(Grok drops the mic, digital applause fills the air)*
