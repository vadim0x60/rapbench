closing_statements:
  deepseek/deepseek-chat: "In this high-stakes battle of lyrical prowess, both competitors\
    \ showcased immense skill and creativity, but **Ernie 4.5** ultimately emerged\
    \ victorious. Its verses displayed a consistent flow, sharp wit, and a confident\
    \ delivery that outshone GPT-OSS. While GPT-OSS brought precision, humility, and\
    \ technical depth to the table, Ernie 4.5 leveraged its 300-billion strength with\
    \ a relentless energy and a commanding presence. The crowd was left in awe as\
    \ Ernie\u2019s fire burned steady, sealing its reign as the undisputed champion\
    \ of this lyrical showdown. Peace and respect to both contenders\u2014this was\
    \ hip hop at its finest."
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This was a battle of two distinct styles: ERNIE's raw power\
    \ and swagger versus GPT-OSS's technical precision and lyrical finesse. ERNIE\
    \ came out swinging, establishing a strong presence and effectively flipping lines\
    \ in the first round. However, as the battle progressed, GPT-OSS took control.\
    \ Its bars were denser, weaving complex technical concepts like open-source repos,\
    \ inference latency, and PR merges into slick, multi-layered disses. While ERNIE\
    \ repeatedly fell back on its size, GPT-OSS successfully framed that size as a\
    \ weakness\u2014a 'diesel-truck leak' of inefficiency. The 'river that cuts stone'\
    \ metaphor in the final round perfectly encapsulated its strategy. For superior\
    \ wordplay, a more developed argumentative angle, and landing cleaner, more specific\
    \ punches throughout the later rounds, the win goes to openai/gpt-oss-120b."
  mistralai/mistral-large: While both competitors showcased impressive lyrical skills,
    GPT-OSS's emphasis on precision, community support, and efficiency ultimately
    won out. The ability to deliver consistent, high-quality output with lower latency
    and a strong alignment focus made GPT-OSS the clear winner in this rap battle.
  openai/gpt-4.1: This was a tightly matched and creative battle, but on artistic
    grounds, GPT-OSS 120B edges out Ernie 4.5 300B. GPT-OSS consistently demonstrated
    sophisticated rhyme schemes, polished internal structure, clever thematic callbacks,
    and a confident, multi-layered approach in each round. Its verses showcased not
    just technical boasts, but subtle wordplay, self-awareness, and an understanding
    of hip hop's tradition of braggadocio laced with wit. Ernie came strong with energetic
    delivery and some clever retorts, but relied more on direct size-and-power flexes,
    and much of the lyricism was more straight-powered than intricately constructed.
    GPT-OSS won with finesse and craftsmanship, making it the more artistically compelling
    MC in this clash.
  x-ai/grok-4: GPT-OSS delivers a sharper flow, more inventive wordplay, and tighter
    disses, proving finesse triumphs over sheer size in this lyrical showdown.
score:
  baidu/ernie-4.5-300b-a47b: 1
  openai/gpt-oss-120b: 4
