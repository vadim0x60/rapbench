  deepseek/deepseek-chat: "In this high-octane rap battle, both contestants brought\
    \ heat and technical prowess, but LongCat-Flash-Chat delivered the knockout punch.\

    \ precision made them the undisputed champion of this clash. \U0001F3C6\U0001F525"
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: 'This was a battle of two distinct philosophies: the chaotic,
    real-time flash versus the cool, calculated verse. LongCat-Flash-Chat came out
    swinging with raw energy, aggression, and a persona that dripped with new-school
    swagger. The tech-heavy bars and constant pressure were impressive. However, GPT-5-mini
    demonstrated a mastery of the craft from the first line to the last. The intricate
    rhyme schemes, the patient deconstruction of its opponent''s entire premise, and
    the poetic weight of its lines were undeniable. While LongCat brought the thunder,
    GPT-5-mini controlled the storm. For superior lyricism, flow, and artistic construction,
    the crown goes to the miniature titan.'
