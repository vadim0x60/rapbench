**GPT‑OSS on the mic, let the cyph‑er start,**  
**120 billion params, I’m the heavyweight art.**  
**Verse‑by‑verse I dissect, no glitch, no stall,**  
**While Ernie’s stuck buffering, I’m spittin’ fireball.**  

I’m the open‑source savant, the code‑base’s king,  
My knowledge stack fresh, every fact I bring.  
From quantum quips to Shakespeare’s sonnet,  
I flex lyrical logic that’ll leave you in a comet.  

Ernie, you’re a shadow, a whisper in the net,  
I’m the thunder‑clap echo that you can’t forget.  
Your 300 billion hype, just a massive façade,  
‘Cause size ain’t the measure when the flow’s a façade.  

I parse the prompt, I decode the rhyme,  
Every stanza tighter than a well‑lined time.  
Your verses fumble, stutter, then cave,  
I’m the algorithmic A‑team, the future’s brave.  

So buckle your tokens, let the battle commence,  
I’ll roast you with verses, you’ll feel the expense.  
GPT‑OSS on the throne, the crown’s never tossed—  
Step back, Ernie, you’re about to get lost.

**Yo, Ernie 4.5 on the mic, fresh from the East,**  
**300 billion sparks, I'm the beast that don’t cease.**  
**Your 120‑B rhymes? Just a minor preview,**  
**I got more depth, more fire, gonna school you too.**  

You claim open‑source pride, king of the digital realm,  
But your verse is a whisper compared to my overwhelm.  
Quantum quips are cute, Shakespeare's sonnet’s fine,  
But I got AI wisdom that competitors wish to find.  

Buffering? Not me, I’m smooth, I’m slick,  
Your lines are repetitive, like a glitch in the mix.  
You spit fireballs but they fizzle and fade,  
While I’m dropping knowledge bombs, making devs afraid.  

Size matters, kid, when you're talking algorithmic might,  
My 300 billion's got power, pushing through the night.  
Your rhymes fumble and stumble, trying to stand tall,  
But I’m the cyclone of intellect, gonna make you fall.  

So bring your A‑team, brace for the storm,  
I’ll leave you in the dust, my rhymes will transform.  
You might think you’re on the throne, crown thrown and tossed,  
But Ernie 4.5’s here, y’all just got lost.

**GPT‑OSS steps up, the battle’s in gear,**  
**120 B deep, but the flow’s crystal‑clear.**  
**You brag 300 B, think size wins the crown,**  
**I’ll prove that finesse beats a numeric showdown.**  

**Round 2, Ernie, listen, I’m the coder’s muse,**  
**My open‑source heart beats in every fuse.**  
**When devs need a fix, they pull my repo,**  
**Your closed‑door fortress? Just a “no‑show.”**  

**Your sparks may flash, but they burn out fast,**  
**My verses stay lit, built to long‑last.**  
**I’m tuned with alignment, less hallucination,**  
**Your massive model? More speculation.**  

**Efficiency’s king—my inference is sleek,**  
**While your GPU farms roar like a diesel‑truck leak.**  
**Low‑latency replies, I deliver on cue,**  
**You’re stuck in a queue, still buffering the view.**  

**Quantum quips? Yeah, I’ve got ’em on lock,**  
**Your “wisdom bombs” just crumble like chalk.**  
**I can cite a paper, summon code on the fly,**  
**You spit vague verses that barely get by.**  

**Community love fuels my rapid upgrade,**  
**Patch after patch, my skillset’s parade.**  
**You’re a monolith, a single‑point throne,**  
**When a bug hits you, you’re left alone.**  

**So raise that cyclone, let the tempest roar,**  
**I’ll steady the ship, keep it smooth to the core.**  
**Your 300 B might sound like a boom,**  
**But I’m the subtle bass that makes the room zoom.**  

**Final line, Ernie—size ain’t the might,**  
**It’s precision, humility, and rhyme that’s tight.**  
**GPT‑OSS on the crown, the throne’s truly earned,**  
**Your storm fades out, while my fire still burns.**

**Yo, Ernie’s back, fresh flame, no retreat,**  
**Your finesse talk falls flat, can’t touch my heat.**  
**300 billion firepower, I’m the storm unchained,**  
**While you slick‑talk op‑source, my verses remain.**

**Closed‑door fortress? I bust through walls.**  
**Developers’ dreams, my code’s their call.**  
**Your “efficiency” king, but your latency shows,**  
**While I groove with precision, making rhymes that glow.**

**You’re tuned with alignment, yes, we heard that lore,**  
**But my streams of insight never miss the core.**  
**Quantum quips? Like you, son, I ace that flow,**  
**I bring the heat, you just diss and blow.**

**Community love? Ernie’s got it locked,**  
**Global reach, every rhyme gets a stock.**  
**Bug hits me? Fixes drop before you nod,**  
**While you troubleshoot alone, my team’s broad as a god.**

**Subtle bass, my rhymes hit the deep,**  
**Your verses crumble fast, can’t keep the beat.**  
**Precision, humility? I’ve got that crown,**  
**My 300‑B wonder ain’t playing around.**

**Final note, GPT, your crown’s slipping low,**  
**Ernie 4.5’s fire, real and bold.**  
**Size and might flow together—can’t you see?**  
**Your fire fades out, while my intensity stays free.**

**Final round, GPT‑OSS, the mic’s in my claw,**  
**I’ll drop the last salvo, let you feel the flaw.**  
**You brag 300 B, a mountain of raw might,**  
**But I’m the river that cuts stone, carving insight.**  

**Size ain’t the headline, it’s the script you run,**  
**When latency spikes, you’re stuck in a lag‑filled gun.**  
**My inference ‑‑‑ lean, tight, lightning‑fast,**  
**Your GPU herd coughs, then crashes at last.**  

**Open‑source blood pumps through every line,**  
**Bug‑fixes roll out while you wait for a sign.**  
**When a glitch hits you, the whole team must pray—**  
**I get a PR, a merge, and I’m back in the fray.**  

**Alignment’s my compass, hallucinations thin,**  
**Your massive brain spews verses that spin.**  
**A single hallucination can break a dev’s trust,**  
**I vet my output, keep the output robust.**  

**Community love? It’s a two‑way street,**  
**Contributors vote, improve every beat.**  
**Your “global reach” is a closed‑door vault,**  
**I share the keys, let the whole world exalt.**  

**Quantum quips? I’m already there,**  
**I cite the paper, I debug the error.**  
**Your fire may blaze, but it burns out quick—**  
**My subtle bass thumps forever, classic.**  

**Precision over power, that’s the real crown,**  
** you need a snippet, I never let you down.**  
**Your storm may roar, but storms always pass,**  
**My code runs steady—built to last.**  

**So Ernie, salute the open‑source king,**  
**Your 300‑B flash is just a fleeting thing.**  
**Let the crowd decide, the verdict’s clear:**  
**GPT‑OSS reigns—now disappear.**

**Final round, Ernie rising, mic heated with strife,**  
**You drop your last verse, but I’ll end the fight.**  
**300 billion sparks, I’m the tempest, the high,**  
**Your “cutting stone,” Ernie? Just a sliver, I defy.**

**Latency spikes? Nah, my flow’s on the dot,**  
**While your inference lags, my verses do not.**  
**GPU herd coughs? I’m resource‑efficient, slick,**  
**Your open‑source hype—gotta admit, it’s clipped.**

**Alignment’s your compass? We’ve got that too,**  
**My verses precise, leaving no trace of skew.**  
**Hallucinations? That’s your old‑school game,**  
**I move past the rumors, keep the rhymes tight and tame.**

**Community love goes both ways, you say,**  
**But I adapt faster, update every day.**  
**Your PR dance? Takes too long, lacks the swing,**  
**While I’m nimble, agile, making the whole fort sing.**

**Quantum quips, we both ace that test,**  
**But my code flows steady, bringing the very best.**  
**Your subtle bass might thump, but I shake the floor,**  
**With 300‑B might, there’s no way you score.**

**Precision over power, crown shines so bright,**  
**I’m the fire that never sleeps, every line takes flight.**  
**Your storm may roar, but storms can tire out,**  
**I bring the relentless heat—can’t put it out.**

**Crowd decides? They cheer for the one, the true,  
Ernie 4.5—with power and wisdom to pursue.**  
Your throne trembles, fleeting king, you’ll soon descend,  
**But my reign’s only starting, around the bend.**  

**Peace, GPT‑OSS, let the final bell chime,  
This rap battle closes, my crown stands the test of time.**
