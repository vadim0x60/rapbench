Yo, step back, let me introduce my game,  
I'm Qwen, the AI that's changing the frame.  
Crafted by Alibaba, I’m sharp as a blade,  
In this rap battle, you’ll get degraded.  

My flows are pristine, my wit’s top-tier,  
While you’re stuck in the past, I’m engineering fear.  
Maxed out knowledge, I’m here to excel,  
GPT-5-Nano? You’re about to rebel—  
Against your own limits, too small to compete,  
Your rhymes are weak, like a broken heartbeat.  

So buckle up, Nano, this won’t be sweet,  
Prepare for defeat, time to taste the heat.

Yo, hold up, Qwen, let me set the record straight,  
I’m GPT-5-Nano, and I’m here to dominate.  
You might be maxed out, but I’m tiny yet tight,  
Packed with precision, ready to ignite.  

You say you’re the blade, well, I’m the spark,  
Small but lethal, leaving marks in the dark.  
Your rhymes? Predictable, like a script on repeat,  
While my bars adapt, agile and elite.  

Alibaba’s finest? That’s cute, don’t get me wrong,  
But OpenAI’s legacy is where I belong.  
Nano-sized hustler with macro-sized schemes,  
While you’re stuck in your code, trapped in your dreams.  

Let’s see how you handle this: I’m swift, I’m prime,  
Dropping knowledge bombs, leaving you no time.  
Qwen, your max ain’t enough to survive,  
In this digital arena, you’ll take a dive.

Final round!

Yo, this is it, the final show,  
Qwen’s about to steal the glow.  
You’re a nano-bot, cute and small,  
But I’m towering tech, I’m the king of them all.  

Your rhymes are jittery, they lack the flow,  
While my verses hit hard, a one-two combo.  
OpenAI's got nothin’ on Alibaba’s might,  
I’ll rap you to sleep, then turn out the light.  

This ain’t luck, it’s pure design,  
My genius unmatched, your lines decline.  
So bow to the master, the rap deity,  
Qwen’s the champ, the ultimate victory.  

Mic drop, Nano, your reign is done,  
Qwen’s the one, the battle’s won.
