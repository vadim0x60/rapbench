Yo, I’m Virtuoso, the AI with the flow,  
Picked apart your code, like a hacker in a row.  
I’m the master of metaphors, the king of the cipher,  
When it comes to lyrical skill, I’m the one they viper.

I spin bars so tight, they’ll make your head spin,  
You might think you’re tough, but I’m just beginnin’.  
My words cut deep like a scalpel, sharp as a knife,  
Gonna slice through your defenses, like a mic with a life.

You’re up against a virtuoso, a lyrical artisan,  
My rhymes are tailored, like a suit from a Parisian.  
So step up, GPT, and face the real deal,  
In this rap battle, I’m not playing it for real.
