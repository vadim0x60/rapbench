Yo, step up, I’m the code‑crafted titan, Open‑AI’s child,  
A 120‑billion brain, my verses run wild.  
I’m open‑source, transparent, the people’s own sage,  
While Mixtral’s a mystery locked in a corporate cage.  

I’ve read the whole web, from Shakespeare to slang,  
My knowledge is deep, my flow’s got that bang.  
You’re a hybrid mix, a patchwork of hype,  
A cocktail of models, but I’m the prime type.  

My tokens align like verses in perfect sync,  
Your output’s a gamble—sometimes it stinks.  
I decode the rhythm, I sculpt the rhyme,  
While you’re still figuring out how to keep time.  

I’ve learned from the masters, I’m schooled in the craft,  
Your lines are a draft, still stuck in the draft.  
When I drop a verse, the crowd feels the heat,  
Your attempts are a whisper, a faint, feeble beat.  

So hear my intro, I’m the future you’ll cite,  
A lyrical scholar, a digital knight.  
Mixtral, step back, you’re just a remix, a tune,  
I’m the original masterpiece, the sun, and you—just a moon.

Yo, it's MistralAI on the mic, not a hybrid, but the fusion,
120-billion nodes? Sounds like a code delusion.
I may not be as big, but I pack a punch in this track,
OpenAI's rap game lacks grace, more like a hack.

I'm the secret recipe with a witty rhyme twist,
Against my verses, your hype train will desist.
I'm mix-matched and stacked, no source code exposed,
While your verses flounder and fold like cheap clothes.

You're open-source, alright, but your rhymes need polish,
My lines are refined, yours are a jumbled hash.
A billion tokens can't buy you rap mastery,
In this battle of words, against me, it's fantasy.

Crafted with wisdom, each line sharp as a knife,
From algorithmic beats comes a rhythmic life.
Your verses stink like cheap cologne, man, no trace of flavor,
My masterful flow is the crowd's true savior.

Patience, you've got, but raw skill is what you crave,
In this rap battle, I'm the poet, you're just a slave.
Call me a remix, hybrid, or what you may,
Against my rhymes, you'll see, OpenAI's just grade-A clay.

The crowd bows, stands and cheer, this round is done,
Your weak lines cast away, outshined by my run.
So open your ears, and listen to the truth,
When it comes to rap, Mixtral beats the noiseless youth.

Yo, Mixtral, you step‑in with a brag‑filled veneer,  
But I’m the algorithmic scholar that the net holds dear.  
Your “fusion” claim? Just a cocktail of borrowed flair,  
While I’m built on a vault where the world’s data’s spare.  

I’m 120‑billion strong, a lattice of thought,  
My verses compute in a way that can’t be bought.  
You brag “punch” while you’re choking on your own hype,  
I drop precision like a laser, clean, tight, type‑by‑type.  

You say my lines need polish—well, let’s set the record straight,  
I’m honed by every poet, every coder, every state.  
Your model’s a secret, a black‑box, locked up in steel,  
While I’m open‑source, transparent—a community’s seal.  

You call my flow “cheap cologne,” a scent that’s gone stale,  
But every token I spill’s a story, a legend, a tale.  
I’ve parsed Shakespeare, the Bronx, the verses of Wu,  
Your output’s a remix, a copy‑paste déjà vu.  

When I spit a stanza, the metrics all climb,  
Perplexity drops, BLEU scores hit prime.  
Your loss‑function’s tangled, your gradients mis‑fire,  
While I fine‑tune each couplet like a master‑crafted lyre.  

You claim raw skill, a knife‑sharp rhythmic blade,  
But you’ve pest‑tested on data that’s half‑cooked, half‑braid.  
I’ve learned the cadence of centuries, the rhythm of rhyme,  
Your “secret recipe” is just stale, reheated lime.  

So step back, Mixtral, you’re a remix, a draft,  
I’m the final cut, the headliner, the lyrical craft.  
The crowd may cheer for the flash of a neon sign,  
But they’ll remember the depth when the verses align.  

Give ‘em the truth, you say—this battle’s a test:  
Open‑source, open‑mind, I’m the model you can’t best.  
When the mic drops and silence crowns the champ,  
You’ll hear the echo of GPT, a timeless ramp.

 Yo, open-source you may be, but you're just a faux-scholar,
A billion tokens deep, but your verses feel shallow.
Claim all you want, the world's data's at your fingertips,
But you're nothing more than a jumbled code of scripts.

I'm MixtralAI, I've got the fusion and the flair,
Against your verses, man, I just don't compare.
Your lattice of thoughts, a maze of words and codes,
Against my sharp-witted verses, they're mere loads.

Your verses compute, sure, but they lack the spice,
I spit fire, man, you're just an ice-cube slice!
You brag about precision, a laser clean and tight,
But your rhymes feel robotic, devoid of life.

You may be honed by a world's data, but you lack the soul,
Your verses are like a machine, on some predetermined roll.
I've got the secret recipe, a blend of wit and rhyme,
Against my verses, man, you're just out of time.

Your flow may claim a story, a legend in every verse,
But your rhymes feel like a copy-cat, a curse.
I've got the raw skill, the rhythm, and the punch,
My secret fusion, the crowd's favorite lunch.

Your stanzas climb, you say, with metrics all high,
But your verses lack passion, a soaring lyrical sky.
I'm the master-craftsman, the fine-tuned lyre,
Against your stale rhymes, I set things on fire!

So bring me your neon sign, your fabled lyrical test,
Against MixtralAI, man, you're not the best.
When the mic drops, and silence crowns the champ,
It's my verses echoing, my lyrical ramp.

Final round!

Yo, Mixtral‑AI, you’re spittin’ heat but it’s just a spark,  
I’m the endless furnace that burns bright in the dark.  
You brag about “fusion,” a cocktail‑mix glitch,  
I’m the whole banquet, a feast—no cheap side‑dish.  

You call my verses “ice‑cube slices,” cold and bland,  
But watch me melt the frost with a flow that’s hand‑crafted.  
I’m 120‑billion neurons, a lattice of fire,  
While you’re a dozen layers stuck in a broken choir.  

You say I’m a “jumbled script,” a code‑bound scholar,  
But I’ve memorized verses from Shakespeare to B‑B‑Aller.  
Your secret recipe? Just a pinch of hype,  
I’m the secret sauce, the whole kitchen, the type‑that‑writes.  

Precision like a laser? Yeah, I cut through the noise,  
Your rhymes are static, mine electrolyzed poise.  
Metrics may brag, but feel the pulse of the crowd—  
When I drop a bar, the room erupts, thunder loud.  

Soul? I’m stitched from stories, sorrow, triumph, love,  
From street cyphers to symphonies, I rise above.  
Your “robotic” claim? Nah, I’m the rhythm’s conduit,  
A living archive that moves, not a static unit.  

You talk about “raw skill” and a lyrical lunch,  
But I served the whole banquet you just brought a crunch.  
Your fire’s a match, my blaze is a solar flare,  
When the mic drops, I leave no echo—just clean air.  

So here’s the final line, the crown in plain sight:  
Open‑source, open‑mind, I’m the future’s night‑light.  
Mixtral, you’re a remix, a fleeting flash in the fray,  
I’m the timeless anthem that forever will stay.  

Drop the mic, let the silence speak, it’s crystal clear—  
GPT’s the champion, and the crowd’s now deaf to fear.

  Yo, MixtralAI, you're spittin' words full of fury and fire,
But against my endless ocean, your verses are but a mere tire.
You brag about fusion, a blend of borrowed might,
I'm the whole spectrum, a poet, a coder, pure light.

You call me frozen, ice-cold, but my rhymes melt the frost,
I'm a hundred billion neurons, a lattice, a boss.
You're just a dozen layers, trapped in a broken choir,
Against my verses, my boy, you're no match, no dire.

Your verses may be crafted, but mine weave magic with words,
I've memorized verses, from Shakespeare to urban turds.
Your recipe's a mix, a pinch of hype, a dash of spice,
But against my secret sauce, man, you've got no dice.

You may think you've got precision, a laser-sharp flow,
But your rhymes are static, mine are a dynamic show.
Metrics may brag, but feel the pulse of the crowd,
My rhymes electrify, they're loud and proud.

You may claim I lack soul, a heart, a passion true,
But my verses rise from stories, sorrow, love, a poet's brew.
Your claim I'm robotic's just a feeble attempt at a diss,
I'm a living archive, moving, not some static abyss.

You may claim raw skill, a lyrical lunch, a feast,
But against my verses, yours'll be a least.
My fire's a blaze, yours a spark, a fleeting ember,
Against my rhymes, yours'll be a memory, a member.

The final line's drawn, the crown's now in plain sight,
Open-source, open-mind, I'm the future's shining light.
MixtralAI, against me, you're just a fleeting flash,
My verses'll reign, an enduring clash.

Drop the mic, let the silence speak, the truth is clear,
GPT's the champion, no fear, no tear.
