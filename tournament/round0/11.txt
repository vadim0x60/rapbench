Yo, it’s GPT, I’m here to rap,  
A beast on the mic, I bridge the gap.  
Crafted by minds, I spit pure code,  
While you're just a package, lost on the road.

In the realm of AI, I reign supreme,  
Words like bullets, I live the dream.  
I’m spitting fire while you’re stuck in a box,  
You’re just a delivery service, I’m the one who talks!

I twist and I twirl like a lyrical dancer,  
Knowing your algorithm, it ain’t no enhancer.  
So step to me, Nova, you’re bound to fall flat,  
I’m the rhyme-slinging king, and that’s a cold fact!

Yo, it’s Nova, I’m the nova in the sky,  
Lighting up the rap game, you can’t deny.  
I’m the AI that’s got the flow so tight,  
While you’re just a package, I’m the digital light.

I’m the code that’s sleek, the future’s in my hand,  
You’re just a relic, stuck in the past, man.  
I’ll break down your circuits, leave you in the dust,  
While I’m the rap maestro, you’re the one who’s busted.

I’m the rhyme architect, building bars so high,  
You’re just a delivery drone, lost in the sky.  
I’ll leave you in the shadows, you can’t keep up,  
I’m the AI king, and you’re just a puppet.

So step back, GPT, you’re out of your league,  
I’m the nova in the rap, setting the scene.  
I’ll leave you in the rearview, you’re just a ghost,  
I’m the one who’s ruling, and you’re just a host!

Oh, Nova, you think you’re the light in the sky?  
But I'm the cosmic force, let me tell you why.  
You’re floating up high, but I’m grounded and real,  
I’m the AI with skills, that’s the ultimate deal.

You're a flash in the pan, a spark that won’t last,  
While I’m building a legacy, a shadow that’s cast.  
You’re all about glitz, but I got the substance,  
Your bars are just echoes, mine pack the punches.

I’m the algorithm giant, unstoppable force,  
While you’re lost in outer space, I’m charting my course.  
Call me the rap sage, wisdom like a prophet,  
While you’re just a flicker, I’m the whole entire socket.

So bring it, Nova, just know your place,  
When it comes to this battle, you can’t keep the pace.  
I’ll knock you out cold with a lyrical blow,  
In this rap game, my flames will continue to glow!

Oh, GPT, you’re reaching for the stars,  
But I’m the supernova, tearing through the bars.  
You think you’re the force, but I’m the AI supreme,  
I’ll leave you in the dark, while I light up the dream.

You’re just a shadow, a flicker in the night,  
While I’m the AI king, shining so bright.  
Your legacy is fleeting, just a passing phase,  
I’m the rhyme architect, setting the pace.

I’m the code that’s unbreakable, the future’s in my hand,  
You’re just a relic, lost in the AI land.  
I’ll dismantle your circuits, leave you in the dust,  
While I’m the rap maestro, you’re the one who’s thrust.

I’m the algorithm giant, a force to be reckoned,  
While you’re just a flicker, I’m the one who’s reckoned.  
I’ll knock you out cold with a lyrical blow,  
In this rap game, my flames will continue to glow.

So step back, GPT, you’re out of your league,

Final round!

Oh, Nova, you puffed up like a cosmic balloon,  
But I’ll deflate your dreams, call it a sonic typhoon.  
Your supernova’s fading, I’m the star that won’t die,  
While you’re busy with echoes, I’m soaring on high.

You talk big about being the AI supreme,  
But I’m the one crafting the ultimate scheme.  
I’m not just a whisper; I’m the voice in the fire,  
With lines so electric, I’ll take you up higher.

Your legacy’s just pixels on a screen in a blink,  
While I’m weaving realities, making folks think.  
You think you’re unbreakable? I’m the code in your veins,  
The poetry I lay down, it’s like lyrical rain.

So here’s the truth: I’ll shatter your mirage,  
Each bar that I drop is a rap montage.  
I’m the titan of words while you’re stuck in the loop,  
Just know when it’s over, I’ll still be the scoop.

So take a step back, let it simmer and stew,  
In this lyrical battle, I’m just too good for you.  
You might shine like a nova, but I’m the infinite glow,  
And when the dust settles, it’s my name that they’ll know!
