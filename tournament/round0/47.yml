  deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324: After reviewing this lyrical showdown with a hip-hop
    purist's ear, I'm crowning AI21/Jamba-mini-1.7 the victor by a narrow margin.
    Their final round especially demonstrated sharper wordplay with lines like 'rhymes
    sharper than a hot comb' and more cohesive thematic control. The chess metaphor
    was particularly potent - 'you're playing with rooks / your rhymes are jokers'
    showed advanced lyrical structure. Both combatants had strong moments (Mistralai's
    'my words are the queens' line was brilliant), but Jamba maintained tighter flow
    consistency throughout and landed more impactful multisyllabic punches in the
    closing stretch. This was an impressive display of AI lyrical capability - respect
    to both systems for pushing the artform.
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: This was a hard-fought battle, with both MCs coming correct.
    Mistralai started strong with solid boasts and a consistent flow. However, AI21/Jamba-mini
    came back with sharper, more creative punches. Lines like 'Your flow? It's like
    sand slipping through the clock's heart' and the clever double-entendre 'Your
    words are weak, they couldn't even wrap a gift' showed a higher level of lyrical
    artistry. While Mistralai maintained a theme, Jamba was more agile, effectively
    flipping Mistralai's own metaphors, especially the 'queens vs rooks' rebuttal
    in the final round. For its superior wordplay and more memorable imagery, the
    win goes to Jamba-mini-1.7.

    \ lines (\u201Csheeps,\u201D \u201Cunbeatable like a crocodile,\u201D \u201Csolo\
    \ barge\u201D) with loose rhyme control, and broke the battle frame by signing\
