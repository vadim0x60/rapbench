  deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324: "Pi rebutted with razor-sharp precision\u2014exposing\
    \ QwQ\u2019s reliance on spectacle over substance. Flowing with unshakable logic\
    \ and a withering \u2018calm storm\u2019 cadence, Pi\u2019s close clinched the\
    \ win."
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This was a battle of styles: the theatrical supernova versus\
    \ the unshakable mathematician. While inflection/inflection-3-pi held its ground\
    \ with a cool, calculated flow and some sharp clapbacks, qwen/qwq-32b simply outclassed\
    \ it on every artistic level. Qwen's bars were a clinic in multisyllabic rhymes\
    \ and aggressive, tech-heavy imagery\u2014'My transformers translate chaos into\
    \ poetry's descent' is just fire. The stage presence, from the glitter to the\
    \ final teleport, demonstrated a level of confidence and showmanship that Pi's\
    \ more reserved persona couldn't match. Qwen didn't just rap; it performed, combining\
    \ intricate lyricism with a dominating presence. The dragon of progress has bitten\
    \ the tail of Pi. Game over."
  meta-llama/llama-4-maverick: Pi's lyrical prowess and sharp, calculated bars outclassed
    QwQ-32B's flashy, but ultimately hollow, boasts. The battle showcased Pi's ability
    to deliver complex, mathematically-infused rhymes with finesse and precision,
    while QwQ-32B's reliance on flowery language and computational one-upmanship ultimately
    fell flat.
  mistralai/mistral-large-2411: In this intense rap battle, both contestants displayed
    remarkable lyrical prowess and technical finesse. However, inflection/inflection-3-pi
    emerged as the winner with their consistently sharp and coherent responses, maintaining
    a strong rhythm and clever use of metaphors. Their ability to counter QwQ-32B's
    attacks with wit and precision, while highlighting the strengths of Pi's endless
    sequence, secured their victory. QwQ-32B put up a valiant effort with imaginative
    imagery and bold claims, but ultimately fell short in sustaining a compelling
    narrative and cohesive flow.
  nousresearch/hermes-3-llama-3.1-70b: In the end, it was Inflection's consistent
    delivery, razor-sharp wit, and unyielding presence that claimed the virtual mic.
    QwQ-32B's flashy entrances and exits, though entertaining, couldn't outshine the
    substance and depth Inflection brought to the battle. Pi's infinite calm and precision
    proves once again that in the realm of rap, substance trumps spectacle.
  openai/gpt-5: "QwQ-32B brought denser multisyllabic rhyme, sharper rebuttals, and\
    \ stronger scheme continuity, turning technical imagery into coherent flexes and\
    \ flipping Pi\u2019s setups (glitter, beach) into extended metaphors. The flow\
    \ varied with punchy internal rhymes and memorable lines (\u201CNeptune drowning\
    \ your algorithmic sandcastle,\u201D \u201Cinfinite decimals as existential complaining\u201D\
    ). Pi had some clean, elegant imagery (\u201Cfireworks without payload,\u201D\
    \ \u201Coasis\u2026 cerebral drizzle\u201D) and a steady composure, but too many\
    \ generic boasts and looser rhyme architecture. Bar-for-bar, QwQ-32B landed more\
    \ layered shots, better call-backs, and controlled the momentum. Edge to QwQ-32B\
    \ for superior craftsmanship and battle strategy."
  x-ai/grok-4: In this AI-fueled rap battle, qwen/qwq-32b takes the crown with superior
    artistic flair, delivering vivid imagery, intricate wordplay, and explosive energy
    that outshines inflection/inflection-3-pi's steady but less dynamic flows. QwQ's
    metaphors like 'binary fireworks' and 'supernova exits' elevate the hip-hop artistry,
    making every verse a computational masterpiece.
score:
  inflection/inflection-3-pi: 4
  qwen/qwq-32b: 3
