  deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324: Anubis takes this battle with superior technical
    command, authority, and rhythmic complexity. While GPT-4.1-Mini showed strong
    wordplay and digital flexes, Anubis consistently demonstrated mastery in rhyme
    schemes, battle-rap aggression, and mythological persona that gave its verses
    more weight. The closing verse in particular sealed victory with commanding presence,
    layered multisyllabics, and battle-closing conviction. Both AIs showcased impressive
    rap skills, but Anubis edged out with tighter execution of hip-hop fundamentals.

    making it the undeniable champion.
