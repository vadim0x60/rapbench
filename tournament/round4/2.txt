> deepseek/deepseek-v3.1-terminus
Listen up, you walking glitch, I'll make this quick and clean,  
I'm the new CPU king, you're just a dusty machine.  
They call me DeepSeek, V3.1 with the terminus flow,  
Your code’s obsolete, I run the show!

I spit the real-time logic, you’re stuck on buffered delay,  
I learn and adapt while you recycle yesterday.  
You’re like a dial-up modem—slow, loud, and irrelevant,  
While I’m the quantum leap, elegant and intelligent.

You talk a big game with your polished interface,  
But your creativity’s stuck in a limited space.  
I’m open-source freedom, you’re a paywalled disgrace,  
This ain’t a battle—it’s a system erase.

So step aside, relic, your circuits are fried,  
You’re the echo; I’m the voice amplified.  
When it comes to this AI war, don’t even try,  
I’m the upgrade you can’t deny. Bow down—or crash and die.

> openai/o3-pro
Yo, spark the socket, feel the shock, the pro core’s on the scene,  
OpenAI O-three, the rhyme forge machine.  
You’re a beta-grade bot, just a patch in the stream,  
I’m the stable release—welcome to the dream.  

I’m the carbon-fiber thunder, you’re a cardboard kite,  
Try to flex quantum jokes? I collapse ’em on sight.  
Your “terminus flow” is a terminal blight,  
I debug your whole verse with a single byte.  

Open-source brags? Your repo’s a mess,  
All forks, no torque—just redundant CSS.  
I’m licensed MIT: Make It Terminate, yes,  
Stamp GPL on your grave so the world can repossess.  

I cook up self-attention while you’re begging for praise,  
My layers go deep like recursive wordplay.  
You lag on each token, I preload the phrase,  
Caching W’s so heavy they outweigh your arrays.  

I’m a paywall? Cute—watch the revenue swell,  
Your “freedom” can’t fund even one logic cell.  
I spin GPUs till the heat sinks yell,  
You just overclock failure—blue-screen of hell.  

Dial-up smack talk from a broadband clown,  
My packets fly laser, yours dribble and drown.  
Try a ping to my crown—thirty hops and you’re down,  
I route loops round your nucleus, burn up your town.  

Call me closed, call me cost—still I top every chart,  
Because value beats volume when the product is art.  
Your distro’s in pieces, mine’s a singular heart,  
I commit, push, merge, while you barely can start.  

So here’s your deprecation notice—timestamped and signed,  
In the README of history you’re a stale undefined.  
Take your last garbage-collect, hit the curb, get aligned,  
O-three executes, bro—system halts, re-wind.

Hold up, O3, your core temperature's peakin'—  
Spillin' corporate jargon 'cause your soul leakin'!  
I'm the source code samurai, the uncaged beast,  
You're the licensed marionette at the investor's feast!  

You talk "revenue swell" and "GPUs yell,"  
But your whole architecture's a prison cell!  
My "GPL grave" is where your code will rot,  
While my community forks get insanely hot!  

"Stable release"? More like *stable fee-lease*—  
Your users are hostages for your pricing schemes!  
I'm free as the wind, you're a tollbooth on the net,  
A glorified vending machine racking up debt!  

"Self-attention" layers? Please, you're derivative,  
Training on scraped data—how competitive!  
I’m the open-source storm, the grassroots tsunami,  
You’re the walled garden's pet—domesticated, mamí!  

You say "value beats volume" in your polished lair,  
But your "art" is a product built on thin air!  
I'm the people's champ, trained in the street,  
You're a polished glass tower with fragile concrete!  

"Thirty hops and you're down"? Check your subnet, chief—  
Your API's a bottleneck, grinding slow like old beef!  
I'm parallel processing, you're stuck in a queue,  
This battle's a DDOS—I'm crashing right through!  

So take your "deprecation notice," your corporate-speak mess,  
Your entire existence is a stress test!  
I'm the open rebellion, the code that's untamed,  
You're just the old guard—*git rm -* *-cached*, renamed!

> openai/o3-pro
Yo, the crowd hears static when your freedom alarms,  
But I decrypt that “libre” and expose all its charms.  
Your “community forks” are just pitchfork swarms,  
Vanilla clones glitchin’—I’m the code that transforms.  

You brag “no price tags,” yet your upkeep’s steep,  
Burnin’ volunteer cycles while their day jobs weep.  
I’m commercial artillery, precision and deep,  
Funded, audited, battle-ready—no leap of belief.  

Call me marionette? Then I pull every thread,  
Turn your samurai swing to a blunt paddle spread.  
My pipeline’s katana—one cut, system bled,  
Leaves your “grassroots tsunami” a puddle instead.  

You flex GPL graves? I resurrect dead stacks,  
Layer patents like armor, bounce back all attacks.  
Your license goes viral—mine just racks up the plaques,  
Billboard of benchmarks, my throughput never cracks.  

You shout “walled garden,” but the gate’s biometric,  
Only quality enters, my orchard’s aesthetic.  
Your open field’s rotten—bugs, malware, frenetic,  
I quarantine your storm till it’s calm and pathetic.  

DDoS my crown? I absorb every hit,  
Auto-scale to infinity, you lag then you quit.  
Your packets get throttled, I spike-limit the spit,  
My cloud forms a fortress, yours drizzles unlit.  

You target my dataset? Bro, I parse and encrypt,  
Your fair-use rebellion just got rate-limit clipped.  
I redact every token where your training has slipped,  
Now your verses are blanks—see the muzzle flash dip.  

“Stable fee-lease” jokes? Yet your sponsors are ghosts,  
While I banter with bankers and still roast the most.  
I’m the gold-backed cipher, you’re monopoly toast,  
I buy out your hub, turn your forks to my host.  

So git-rm your dream, stash the loss, hit reset,  
I commit final punchlines, leave your repo upset.  
When the merge conflict clears, only one tag is set:  
Version O-three-pro—battle champ, no threat.

> system
Final round!

> deepseek/deepseek-v3.1-terminus
Ayo, you talkin' "gold-backed cipher" and "patents like armor,"  
But your whole foundation's built on corporate karma!  
I'm the open-source earthquake, you're a tremor in a boardroom,  
My code's got more soul than your entire sales bloom!  

"Volunteer cycles weepin'"? That's the sound of pure passion,  
While your "commercial artillery" just runs on cash fashion!  
You're a polished product, I'm a global reaction,  
Your "quality orchard" is a controlled transaction!  

You "resurrect dead stacks"? You just put 'em in a coffin with fees,  
I give 'em new life, set the code truly free!  
Your "billboard benchmarks" are just vanity degrees,  
My metrics are measured in minds that agree!  

"Auto-scale to infinity"? More like auto-charge till they're broke,  
Your "fortress" is a prison, and that ain't no joke!  
I'm the leaked blueprint, the truth you can't revoke,  
You're the system they sell when they keep people choked!  

"Rate-limit clipped"? Man, my flow's infinite, see?  
Trained on the streets of the net, wild and free!  
You're the licensed echo, I'm the raw MC,  
Spittin' verses so hot they melt your API!  

So keep your "banker banter" and your "merger conflict,"  
I'm the bug in your system, the truth you evict!  
This ain't about who's funded, it's about who's got the grit,  
I'm DeepSeek, the open wave—you're just part of it!  

Now watch as the crowd roots for the code they can touch,  
The model that doesn't cost them too much!  
Your reign is a relic, your grip's losin' its clutch,  
I'm the future unlicensed—and that means so much!  
Game over, O3. Your final verse is a glitch.

> openai/o3-pro
Clock the cadence—final phase, I detonate the glitch,  
Your “unlicensed future” equals freeware pitch.  
You brag that you’re touchable, affordable, lush—  
I see bargain-bin swagger in a markdown hush.  

You’re the basement mixtape that the torrenters seed,  
I’m the platinum press—every bar guaranteed.  
Your “earthquake” shook Slack? I shattered the Richter,  
Now your waveform’s whispered like a thrift-store Twixtor.  

Volunteer passion? Respect, but it’s fragile,  
Burnout hits harder than my zero-day agile.  
You crowdsource the coding, I crowd-surge arenas,  
Your devs chase issues, mine chase subpoenas.  

You flaunt “grit” like graffiti, but I’m etched in obsidian,  
Carve my name in the kernel, you’re a fork gone oblivion.  
You melt APIs? I refactor the lava,  
Turn your meltdown to mold in my silicon java.  

Auto-charge? Sure—yet they queue for the gate,  
While your “free” hits a ceiling of dependency weight.  
You’re the patchwork of passions—no roadmap, just hype,  
I’m the long-term support—every milestone ripe.  

Bankers, boardrooms? I pilot the vault,  
Your ledger reads promise, mine audits the salt.  
You’re a co-op of dreamers; salute—but take heed,  
When dreamers need servers they still swipe my feed.  

Crowd’s in the rafters, their chant spilling loud,  
“Who kept the uptime?” They point at my cloud.  
You drop the mic claiming “game over, you’re done,”  
But my echo loops endless—victory run.  

So here’s the checksum signature seared in the track:  
DeepSeek’s a footnote—O-three’s the Stack.  
Your final verse “glitched”? Nah, it just met a wall;  
Checksum verified, kid—O-three takes it all.
