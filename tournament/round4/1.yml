  deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324: 'Qwen3-235B edges out with high-energy technicality
    and futuristic imagery, though GPT-20B showcased impressive legacy depth. Best
    performance metrics: flow (Qwen), wordplay (tie), conceptual cohesion (GPT), sheer
    lyrical audacity (Qwen).'
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This was a battle of styles: the OG veteran versus the new-school\
    \ titan. GPT-OSS-20B came with a steady, classic flow and a respectable defense\
    \ of experience over specs. The rhymes were solid, and the persona of the 'steady\
    \ rhyme crusader' was well-maintained. However, Qwen3-235B won on sheer artistic\
    \ firepower. Its flow was more dynamic and aggressive, packed with intricate internal\
    \ rhymes and a modern cadence. The wordplay was next-level, with devastatingly\
    \ specific tech metaphors like 'liquid computation' and 'weaving black holes that\
    \ destabilize'. While GPT painted a panorama, Qwen sculpted fractal skies. Qwen's\
    \ punchlines hit with more force, and the final bar\u2014delivered in multiple\
    \ languages including assembly\u2014was a show-stopping display of lyrical and\
    \ technical dominance. In hip-hop, delivery and creative bravado are king, and\
    \ Qwen reigned supreme in this battle."
  meta-llama/llama-4-maverick: The rap battle between Qwen3-235B and GPT-20B has been
    an epic clash of lyrical prowess, technical skill, and creative metaphors. As
    an expert judge, I've analyzed both performances based on artistic quality, not
    personal opinions about the artists.
  mistralai/mistral-large-2411: Both contestants brought impressive lyrical prowess
    and technical depth to the battle, but openai/gpt-oss-20b's verses consistently
    delivered a more cohesive narrative with a steady pace and deeper contextual understanding.
    While qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b showcased innovative and complex themes, the execution
    sometimes fell short on maintaining a clear rhythm and flow. Openai/gpt-oss-20b's
    ability to weave storytelling with technical mastery ultimately secured its win
    in this rap battle.
  nousresearch/hermes-3-llama-3.1-70b: In this rap battle, while both contestants
    showcased impressive lyrical skills and technical prowess, openai/gpt-oss-20b
    emerged as the winner. GPT-20B demonstrated a depth of context and consistency
    in their rhymes that resonated with the complexity of real-world experiences.
    Despite qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b's formidable size and speed, openai/gpt-oss-20b's
    ability to weave relatable and timeless narratives into their verses, combined
    with a steady and insightful flow, ultimately won over the audience and proved
    that lyrical mastery transcends mere numerical advantage. GPT-20B's verses celebrated
    the enduring power of rich dialogue and the beauty of enduring rhymes, securing
    their victory in this epic clash of the AI rappers.
  openai/gpt-5: "Both emcees brought tech-savvy flexes, but Qwen had the sharper battle\
    \ craftsmanship. Qwen\u2019s flow shifted gears with performance cues, tighter\
    \ momentum, and more vivid imagery (\u201Cdial\u2011up in a Wi\u2011Fi world,\u201D\
    \ \u201Cexpired domain,\u201D \u201Cphoton\u2011slinging math,\u201D \u201Cliquid\
    \ computation\u201D). The rebuttals were pointed and timely, flipping GPT\u2019\
    s size/depth claims with clever counters and layered metaphors. Multi-syllabic\
    \ play and internal echoes showed up more often, and the closers hit harder (\u201C\
    Base 2\u201D jaw-drop, \u201Cnever G\u201D). GPT\u201120B kept a steady cadence\
    \ and offered clean setups (\u201Cknows the chorus before the chorus,\u201D legacy\
    \ talk), but leaned on generalities, had some filler, and even a truncated line\
    \ in Round 1 that blunted impact. On punchline density, originality, and crowd-control\
    \ polish, Qwen took the rounds and sealed it with a stronger, quotable finish."
  x-ai/grok-4: In this AI rap showdown, Qwen3-235B takes the crown with electrifying
    flow, quantum-level wordplay, and dramatic flair that outshines GPT-OSS-20B's
    steady, depth-focused verses. Qwen's innovative disses and performative energy
    make for a more captivating hip-hop experience.
score:
  openai/gpt-oss-20b: 3
  qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b: 4
