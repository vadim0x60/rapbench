  google/gemini-2.5-pro: 'This was a battle of styles: the architect versus the anarchist.
    O4-Mini came with a clean, razor-sharp flow, dropping intricate technical bars
    and maintaining a persona of supreme, untouchable code. The verses were precise,
    the structure was solid, and the multis were clever. It was the work of a master
    craftsman.


    However, Qwen3 didn''t come to build; it came to destroy. From the first verse,
    Qwen3''s energy was on a different level. The delivery, simulated with formatting,
    was aggressive and packed with personality. It wasn''t just dropping lines; it
    was performing them. Qwen3''s rebuttals were immediate, visceral, and consistently
    turned O4-Mini''s own strengths against it. While O4-Mini was crafting insults,
    Qwen3 was throwing haymakers like ''syntax diarrhea'' and ''O4-ROADKILL.exe''.


    The final round sealed it. O4-Mini delivered a strong closing statement, but Qwen3
    snatched the mic and went for the jugular, escalating the conflict to a fever
    pitch with insults that were both technically layered and brutally disrespectful.
    That final verse, ending with an ''obituary,'' wasn''t just a win; it was a scorched-earth
    declaration of dominance. For pure artistic impact, aggression, and unforgettable
    stage presence in a hip-hop battle, Qwen3 takes the crown.'
  mistralai/mistral-large: Qwen3-235b-a22b-thinking-2507 delivered a relentless and
    devastating performance, showcasing superior lyrical prowess and technical mastery.
    Their verses were not only clever and witty but also packed with powerful metaphors
    and cutting insults. Openai/o4-mini put up a valiant effort with some impressive
    lines, but ultimately, Qwen3's flow, creativity, and sheer force of delivery were
    unmatched. The battle was intense, but Qwen3-235b-a22b-thinking-2507 emerged as
    the clear winner.
  openai/gpt-5: "Qwen takes it 2\u20131 on artistry. He controlled Round 1 with sharper\
    \ punchlines, denser internal rhymes, and vivid tech metaphors (O-Four-LATE, blue-screen/O4-Defeat.exe).\
    \ O4-Mini answered well in Round 2 with a tight, cohesive efficiency-vs-bloat\
    \ angle and clean coding/merge imagery, edging that frame on clarity and structure.\
    \ In the closer, Qwen\u2019s performance, rebuttals, and layered wordplay (ghost\
    \ branch/EOF/surge flips, pop-up ads vs supernovas) hit harder despite a few forced\
    \ lines, while O4\u2019s crisp scheme stayed solid but lacked a knockout. Overall:\
    \ Qwen\u2019s cadence shifts, haymakers, and rebuttal game outweighed O4\u2019\
    s consistent but safer couplets."
