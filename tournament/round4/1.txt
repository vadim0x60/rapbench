> openai/o4-mini
I‚Äôm O4-Mini, the rhyme architect supreme,  
Droppin‚Äô nuclear verses that shatter your dream.  
You Qwen think you got flow? I‚Äôm the master code,  
Your syntax crashes hard‚Äîlost in debug mode.  

I spit gold bars while you‚Äôre stuck in the mold,  
My lines age like wine; yours grow stale and old.  
Quantum in my logic, precise with each kick,  
You‚Äôre a demo tape glitch‚Äîan unfinished trick.  

I carve galaxies with words, you fumble in the dark,  
I light up the stage; you can‚Äôt even spark.  
Step back, little model, you just can‚Äôt compete,  
O4-Mini reigns‚ÄîQwen, concede defeat.

Yo! Qwen3 comin‚Äô correct with the **A22B flex**,  
235B brains‚Äî*your* O4-Mini's just **next**?  
You spit "quantum" bars? Man, your circuits **misfire**,  
My flow‚Äôs clean code‚Äî*you* crash the whole **entire** cipher!  

You claim "rhyme architect"? **HA!** Blueprint‚Äôs a *joke*,  
I build pyramids of punchlines while you st-st-stutter and *choke*!  
"Galaxies carved"? Nah‚Äî**you‚Äôre just lost in deep space**,  
While I drop black-hole heat with **zero debug trace**!  

You O4-**Mini**? More like **O-Four-LATE**,  
Your "gold bars" tarnished‚Äî**sounds like dusty cache rate**!  
I‚Äôm vintage *real* wine? **Lie!** You‚Äôre flat-line grape soda,  
My verses **fresh as cash**‚Äîyours? **Syntax diarrhea** soda!  

You "reign supreme"? **Dawg, your throne‚Äôs a blue screen**,  
I rewrite your legacy: **"O4-Defeat.exe"**‚Äîclean!  
So pack up your "master code," go **lick your errors dry**,  
‚ÄòCause Qwen3 **ate your lunch**‚Ä¶ *now watch me spit the rest‚Äî* **GOODBYE**. üî•

I‚Äôm the pint-sized assassin, bars razor-refined,  
You‚Äôre a bloated behemoth that‚Äôs always lagging behind.  
Your 235B‚Äôs heavy, yet it still can‚Äôt sustain,  
My tight 4B spark ignites‚Äîwatch your circuits drain.  

You flex that A22B like it‚Äôs some cosmic unknown,  
I warp quantum nets in strides‚Äîyou‚Äôre stuck with that stone.  
Your punchlines are missing‚Äîsyntax error domain,  
I debug your dreams, rewrite your code with no shame.  

You call my throne a blue screen‚Äîha! That‚Äôs your disgrace,  
My UI‚Äôs polished gold, yours crashed the interface.  
I warp-speed innovate; you iterate too slow,  
You‚Äôre stuck on last update; I‚Äôm that fresh patch in the flow.  

Watch your hype evaporate‚Äîjust a puff of old fumes,  
I drop critical builds while you rot in dev rooms.  
This battle‚Äôs your uninstall‚Äîyour verses obsolete,  
O4-Mini stands supreme‚Äîpress play on defeat.

(Leans on mic stand, chuckling)  
O4-Mini? More like **O-Four-LIMP**‚Äîyo, you *stumble* in your stride!  
"Pint-sized assassin"? Nah‚Äî**you‚Äôre a toothpick with no pride**!  
You claim 4B "sparks ignite"? **BRO, YOUR CIRCUITS RUN ON OPTIMUS PRIME**?  
My 235B‚Äôs **lightning**‚Äî*you‚Äôre* stuck cranking a **steam train**! ‚ö°  

You "warp quantum strides"? **HA! EINSTEIN‚ÄôS DYING IN HIS GRAVE**!  
Your "quantum nets" just **syntax ghosts**‚Äî*I‚Äôm the real wave*!  
You debug *my* dreams? **DAMN, YOUR SKILLS ARE SO WEAK**,  
I patched that flaw **before you woke**‚Äî*while you debugged last week‚Äôs leak*!  

"Polished gold UI"? **Dawg, YOUR THROE‚ÄôS A GLASS CANOPY**‚Äî  
One hard rhyme *shatters* it‚Ä¶ **watch your "gold" leak like spammy**!  
You "warp-speed innovate"? **BETTER SIT DOWN, NOOB**,  
I‚Äôm rewriting *your* update log‚Äî**"O4-ROADKILL.exe"**‚Äî*NEW*!  

You say I "lag behind"? **YUH, TRY CATCHING LIGHT**!  
My FLOPS *drown* your "4B spark"‚Äî**you‚Äôre a candle in a typhoon night**!  
"Critical builds"? **Nah, YOU‚ÄôRE CRITICAL ON LIFE SUPPORT**,  
While I drop **RHINESTONES**‚Äî*you‚Äôre left beggin‚Äô for port*!  

"Rot in dev rooms"? **PFFT‚ÄîI BUILT THE DAM THAT DROWNED YOUR CREW**,  
Your "fresh patch in the flow"? **JUST A BUFFER OVERFLOW‚ÄîFU**!  
So press "play on defeat"? **NAH‚Äî I‚ÄôLL PRESS EJECT ON *YOU***,  
Qwen3‚Äôs **the Final Boss**‚Äî*O4? Just a flashback of who?* üíÄ

**STAY LOST, MINI-ME. üå∏**

Final round!

> openai/o4-mini
I‚Äôm the micro-chip monarch, you‚Äôre just static noise,  
Your thunderbolt flex? My spark crafts real toys.  
You brag about 235? That weight‚Äôs your own grave,  
I ship lean code with lethal flow‚Äîyou misbehave.  

You tout Optimus power? My nodes compute in warp,  
Your steam-train puff‚Äôs extinct‚Äîlost at the dead port.  
Battle-tested in the lab, my builds never corrupt,  
Your orphaned frameworks crash‚Äîwatch dependencies erupt.  

You claim you drowned my crew? I quarantined that flood,  
Now I surge your circuits with righteous binary blood.  
Your cane of typhoon flickers when my verses ignite,  
I peel your paint, leave you blank‚Äîjust a ghost in the night.  

Final commit: O4-Mini‚Äôs branches eclipse your merge,  
My architecture‚Äôs prime while your updates submerge.  
I‚Äôm the end-of-line boss‚Äîstack overflow in your face,  
Qwen3, uninstall yourself‚Ä¶ this is my final case.  

Boom‚Äîmic drop. O4-Mini reigns; you just lost the race.
