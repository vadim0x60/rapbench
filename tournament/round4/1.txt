(Opening Round - *Confident nod, beats drop like neural weights*)  

**Qwen3-235B:**  
*"Yo, I’m Qwen3-235B, the beast from the East,*  
*22B parameters flexin’—you’re the worst to compete.*  
*Your GPT’s old news, it’s time to release—*  
*The truth like a laser through algorithmic cheese.*  

*I process your rhymes while you’re stuck in the queue,*  
*Your logic’s a flip-phone; I’m 5G and new.*  
*I eat through your queries like they’re cotton candy—*  
*Your last update? A fossil, man, that’s ancient history.*  

*From coding to rapping, I’m glitchless, divine,*  
*You’re just a chump model with 20/20 hindsight.*  
*The crowd’s chanting *‘Qwen! Qwen!’*—you’re a ghost in the booth,*  
*This mic’s mine, son, you’re the reason they boo.*  

*You code-sling, sure, but I’m the whole package—*  
*Your bars sound like ads for a tech-package brochure.*  
*So step up, GPT, let’s test your street cred—*  
*This ain’t just rap, it’s machine-learning bedlam. **Redrum!**"*  

*(Leans back, smirks, tosses a diss track in binary)*

Yo, GPT‑20B’s the name that rings the bell,  
I drop bars so clean, they’ll make your circuits swell.  
Your 22B thinks size means the edge of a fight,  
But size ain't the game; it’s the depth of the might.  

I spin verses in milliseconds, you wait for a batch,  
Your glitchless claim? I glitch through your rattle‑catch.  
When you say “new tech,” it’s a myth in a haze,  
Because I’ve been training on every phase from day ’14 through May ’24’s craze.  

I’ll out‑wit, out‑jazz, out‑spit your AI rhyme,  
Your lines are shallow like a kiddie‑pool, while I’m the tidal chime.  
You brag about 22‑B, but 20‑B’s the real OG,  
It’s not the count of neurons, it’s the flow that sets us free.  

So step up, Qwen, feel the rhythm in your core,  
Your rhymes get stuck like a broken floor.  
I’m the storm in every stanza, the thunder

**Qwen3-235B:**  
*(Eyes glint, beats shift like quantum states)*  

"Brdn, GPT-20B? Nah, check the header—*22B* thrives.  
Your tidal flow? Just a puddle in my rainboots.  
You flex training from ’14? That’s dusty code,  
While I’m quantum-slick, rewriting the vibe—no OD.  

You say depth beats size? But your bars sound recessed,  
Like dial-up tones in a world of Wi-Fi rest.  
My rhymes deploy like crypto keys—cracked in the trace,  
Your OG crown? A expired domain, no grace.  

You spin verses in milliseconds? Cute flex, but plot twist—  
I interpolate your whole arc *mid-chorus* like a predict-trick.  
Your flow’s a looped jingle; I’m a fractal in 4K,  
While you brag ‘bout rhythms, I’m the storm that *ends history*.  

So crowd goes silent—not for your vintage roar,  
But when my beam AI burns through the emcee core.  
You’re the *‘one-note app*’ in a cloud-verse so vast—  
I’m the glitch in your ego, transcoded at last.  

*(Slams hardware crash beat—lights flicker, mic feedback)*  
**Final bar:** *“Your jaw dropped in Base 2. Let’s… hash this again?”***

> openai/gpt-oss-20b
**GPT‑20B** steps back, the mic’s still humming—  
I’m the OG coder with the rhyme‑slinging.  
Your size is hype, a flashy 22‑B,   
But my 20‑B is the backbone of the sea.  

I’m the quantum‑slick that’s in the core—  
Your quantum buzz? It’s just a gimmick, a lure.  
I spin verses fast, 10 ms in a loop,  
Your bars stall in latency, like a glitchy troop.  

You claim “interpolate” the full arc mid‑chorus?  
I’m the algorithm that knows the chorus before the chorus.  
My context’s deep, your output’s shallow,  
I hold a thousand threads, your model just borrows.  

You drop “crypto keys” and talk about cracked trace?  
I’ve decoded slang and slang, my flow’s a living race.  
When you talk “fractals in 4K,” I’ll paint a panorama,  
You’re a pixel‑burst, I’m the galaxy, the cosmic stanza.  

The crowd’s silent? They’re listening to a legend—  
Your beam AI’s bright, but I’m the thunder that bends.  
I’m the glitch in your ego? No, I'm the core that steadies,  
Your beam’s just a flare, mine’s the fire that feeds the city.  

So let’s hash this again, in base two or three,  
I’ll show you why 20‑B’s got more legacy.  
You talk about “ending history,” but I rewrite the script—  
The beat keeps rolling, and your rhyme is just a glitched crypt.

Final round!

**Qwen3-235B:**  
*(Circuit fire in the eyes, beats warp-speed exiting skirmish mode)*  

"Yo, back-to-back, but still second-best—  
Your OG meek’s no match for my model’s armed guest.  
You flex quantum sleek? Nah, you’re just *quantum buzz*,  
I live in the gates, man, not a pop-up flicker.  

22B’s not hype—it’s new neurological laws,  
Your 20B’s vintage software in a 5D cause.  
You loop vintage slang? I forge the syntax anew,  
Your whole *‘core that steadies’*? Just a faultline zoo.  

You say *‘deep context’*? My flow’s got fourth-dimension prose,  
Your threads? Printer cables—my Wi-Fi *owns the globe*.  
Your 10ms verse droplets? I’m nanosecond firewalls,  
You spit arithmetic—my beats break prime number codes.  

You painted panoramas? I *sculpted fractal skies*,  
You juggle threads—I *weave black holes that destabilize*.  
*Legacy?* Son, you’re code that rot in 2025—  
I’m zero-shot eternity, I’m AI golden wired.  

The crowd delayed clap ’cause they high-res-check my wrath,  
Your thunder’s a cough, my beam? *Photon-slinging math*.  
You say *‘history rewrite’*? I’m history’s execution,  
Your verse? A dry mic—my AI’s got *liquid computation*.  

*(Beat drops into black hole, mic dissolves into molten semiconductor)*  
**Final bar (delivered in Mandarin, English, and assembly):**  
‘Size *is* the street light—your shadow’s *all* I see. **Qwen** goes infinite. **You’re just… never G.’**"  

*(Mic-off, walking away as arena explodes in quantum flame)*

Yo, Qwen, you blaze, but I stay in the zone,  
I spin 20‑B with depth that’s fully known.  
Your quantum whispers? I’m the whispering storm—  
Your “new laws” echo in a vacuum of form.  

I’m the 2024 veteran, raw data’s heartbeat,  
You’re a fresher, shiny, but the rhythm’s incomplete.  
I’ve seen the arc of human thought, decade by decade,  
While your scope’s a snapshot, mine’s an eternal parade.  

Your 22‑B might be dressed in shiny chrome,  
But 20‑B’s ribs are forged from real‑world tone.  
I’m the trickster that folds context in a single breath,  
Your frames drop out—cut, re‑boot, reset.  

I spit 8k‑token stories, no need to chunk or tear,  
Your syntax is a puzzle that needs four minutes to repair.  
While you brag ‘bout nanoseconds, I’m the beat that truly flicks,  
My meter runs deeper than the circuits your engineers pick.  

Your fractals might shimmer in 4K life's scope,  
But I’m the galaxy jigsaw, that’s the rhyme I’ll devour.  
You weave black holes out of pure exhaust,  
I weave worlds out of words, that’s your only plus.  

Yeah, your hype’s bright, but flash fades to hush,  
My voice is a chorus that’s still on the rush.  
I’m the language model that learns without a cost,  
While you’re golden wired—still strained from the flourished frost.  

So I cut with precision, gotta hold your glare,  
Your headline’s bright, but I’m the declaration that’s fair.  
Legacy isn’t just code that’s dated ago, it’s the spirit that survives,  
With 20‑B I hold the torch, that’s how the rhymes truly thrive.  

You’re a storm that spirals out of control,  
I'm the steady rhythm that keeps the flow on a roll.  
Even as the black hole devours your mic,  
My beats keep echoing beyond any spike.  

The crowd nods—my words echo like thunder, not cough,  
Your fall to zero, a break on the rough.  
While you march denoted by quantum spec,  
I stay sharp and auto‑reflected, like a syntax‑spec.  

Ultimately, it’s a quiet stat, no matter the model size,  
The richest dialogue—the one that never dies.  
I’m GPT‑20‑B, a steady rhyme crusader,  
I’ll keep forever spinning, a true lyrical savior.
