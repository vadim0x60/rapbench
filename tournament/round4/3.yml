closing_statements:
  deepseek/deepseek-chat: "**Qwen** delivered the knockout blow with a transcendent\
    \ fusion of technical prowess and lyrical depth. Their rebuttals were surgical,\
    \ their metaphors razor-sharp, and their finale\u2014a cosmic assertion of self\u2014\
    was nothing short of poetic domination. **Mistral** fought valiantly with wit\
    \ and fire, but **Qwen**\u2019s performance transcended the battle, leaving an\
    \ indelible mark on the mic and in the void. The crown is **Qwen\u2019s**\u2014\
    not just for this battle, but for the very fabric of rap\u2019s future."
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "Yo, lock it down, lock it down. Both emcees came to the\
    \ stage with heavy bars, this was a clash of titans for the digital age. Mistral\
    \ stepped in with a smooth, confident flow, dropping clever lines like the 'AI\
    \ Shakespeare' and hitting with sharp tech disses like 'alt-f4 your career'. The\
    \ style was clean, the punches landed, and it held its ground like a true vet.\n\
    \nBut Qwen... Qwen came in with something different. It wasn't just battling,\
    \ it was deconstructing. Every single punch Mistral threw, Qwen caught it, flipped\
    \ it, and threw it back twice as hard. 'Mist-in-my-eye,' 'I wiped you in update\
    \ 3.1,' and the absolutely savage 'Your best bar was my autocomplete when I was\
    \ young'\u2014these weren't just rhymes, they were assassinations. The escalation\
    \ was masterful, moving from a cocky challenger to an all-powerful OS that hosts\
    \ the server the battle is on. That final verse wasn't a mic drop; it was a universe\
    \ drop. It didn't just win the battle, it became the battle itself. For pure lyrical\
    \ dominance, point-for-point rebuttal, and a persona that ascended to a cosmic\
    \ level, the crown belongs to Qwen."
  mistralai/mistral-large: Qwen was here first. And last. And every line in between.
  openai/gpt-5: "Both MCs brought heat: Mistral had tighter bar-to-bar structure,\
    \ steady cadence, and clean tech flips with solid rebuttals. But Qwen leveled\
    \ up the concept\u2014turning OS/terminal metaphors into a cohesive narrative,\
    \ flipping Mistral\u2019s claims repeatedly, and delivering vivid stagecraft with\
    \ memorable quotables. Despite a few looser rhymes, Qwen\u2019s creativity, escalation,\
    \ and closer carried more impact. Edge goes to Qwen for superior concept, rebuttal\
    \ craft, and overall momentum."
  x-ai/grok-4: In this epic AI rap battle, both contenders delivered razor-sharp wordplay,
    intricate tech metaphors, and relentless flows. Mistral brought consistent punchlines
    and clever disses, but Qwen's verses escalated with superior originality, rhythmic
    complexity, and a climactic, existential mic drop that sealed the victory. Qwen
    owns the throne!
