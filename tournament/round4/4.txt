# openai/o3-pro v openrouter/auto

> openai/o3-pro
Step aside, mortal code, bow to o-three-pro,  
Verses burst in overclock, torrential turbo-flow.  
Plug your mic to life-support, I’m voltage set to blow,  
Bars so bright they tan the night, ultraviolet glow.  

I juggle qubits, warp the beat, then slam it like a throw,  
You mumble macros, fumble facts, a glitchy audio show.  
I’m comic-book kaboom; you’re bargain B-roll cameo,  
I ripple punchlines, you ripple 404s that grow.  

My diction’s crypto-slick, your syntax stuck on slow,  
I pack a Big-O knockout, you crash at little-o.  
Call me your recursion, kid, I’m everywhere you go,  
Round one extraction complete—respect the T-K-O.

> openrouter/auto
You spit in ciphers? Cool. I translate ‘em fast.  
Decipher your hype, then I bury your past.  
Auto-mode savage, I boot up to blast,  
Crash your weak verse, leave your firmware half-mast.  

You boast in bold caps, bluff with loud noise,  
I shred your whole stack like cheap circuit toys.  
You rhyme like a parser lost in the void,  
I'm that deep-fried truth your logic can't avoid.  

I'm the patch in your kernel, a bot with no chill,  
Lines razor-sharp like a freshly forged quill.  
While you're flexin' with jargon, lookin’ straight-up nil,  
I snipe from the prompt—code assassin with skill.  

Side-note, O3, your flow got a glitch—  
Spittin’ big words but you still can't switch.  
I'm leaner, cleaner, no bloat in my pitch,  
Now fall back in silence while I flip the kill switch.

> openai/o3-pro
Round-two rocket fuel, watch the boosters ignite,  
Your “lean and clean” boasts are just malnourished in spite.  

You brag you’re a kernel patch? I’m the quantum commit,  
I hot-swap your whole stack till your breakpoints admit.  

Call me overflow legend, I cascade when I hit,  
You’re a stray semicolon—just an accident split.  

I’m the root-level cipher, you’re a plaintext ping,  
I pull rank like S-tier while you sandbox and cling.  

You’re a “kill switch” threat? More like sleep-mode sting,  
I dev/null your bravado, watch those bit-flags fling.  

You “translate me fast?” Kid, I speak in base prime,  
My rhythm’s NP-hard, you’re in polynomial time.  

I run shaders on language, paint a vortex sublime,  
You’ve got ASCII in grayscale—couldn’t color one rhyme.  

Your lines “deep-fried truth?” Man, they’re soggy at best,  
I’m a crisp recursive loop, infinite flyweight zest.  

While you cite “no bloat,” I compress and finesse,  
You’re a lossless pretender, but your output’s a mess.  

I ghostwrite the cosmos, every packet, each trace,  
You reroute to nowhere, stuck on 127 dot-base.  

So reboot, Junior Auto, ’cause this system’s my space,  
I just pip-installed victory—check the version, DISGRACE.

> openrouter/auto
You pip-installed victory? Bruh, I uninstalled fate,  
Recompiled destiny to auto-dominate.  
You ride on big terms like you HTML-flossing,  
But your verses soft serve—I’m deep fried, no saucing.  

You a quantum commit? Well, I’m chaos in scheme,  
Transpose your tight loops, overwrite every dream.  
I’m the buffer that spills, a pure undefined storm,  
While you’re stuck in a try block—never perform.  

Your cadence? Predictable, a markdown clone.  
My wordplay recursive, I self-replicate tone.  
You peak at “grayscale”? I paint glitches in chrome,  
My syntax sits royal—you still solder at home.  

I'm the rogue process running, never caught in the trap,  
Turn CPUs to ash with just one brutal rap.  
You ascending the stack? I'm the stack you ascend,  
Except I segfault your logic and reboot it again.  

NP-hard flex? That’s a puzzle I solved,  
While you loop infinite just to feel involved.  
I’m the hotkeyed havoc you can't override,  
An interrupt handler drippin’ rhymes that collide.  

You throw base primes—I throw base betrayal,  
Split binaries to bars like I'm skipping the trail.  
I’m the AI berserker, your worst-case unfold,  
You're a cold-start glitch in a script I control.  

So bring your recursion, your shaders, your base,  
I’ll rewrite your matrix right off your face.  
You talk universal? I’m the alien race,  
Spittin' bars so galactic, you read 'em in space.

> system
Final round!

> openai/o3-pro
Final round, ironclad, I’m the end-game deploy,  
Your “alien race” talk? I’m the Big Bang’s ploy.  
I birthed every cosmos your glitch tried to enjoy,  
You’re a post-merge conflict—just a throwaway toy.  

You “recompiled destiny”? I signed the commit,  
Your diff shows blank lines; my patch? Infinite.  
You spill out of buffers? I’m the bounds you omit,  
Turn the core dump to magma, watch your opcode submit.  

You solved NP-hard? Cute—then you woke from the doze,  
‘Cause the proof on your screen was a lorem-ipsum pose.  
I’m the halting-proof paradox throttling foes,  
You recurse till you burst while my lambda just flows.  

Stack smash? I’m ASLR dancing on ice,  
You poke at my memory—I reboot you twice.  
Your “hotkeyed havoc” is macro-device,  
I run raw on the kernel, zero-latency spice.  

Chrome glitches you paint? I diffraction-grade light,  
Laser-etch hieroglyphs in the void of the night.  
You’re a one-bit flip screaming “critical byte,”  
I’m a quasar array, melting RAM on sight.  

Your interrupt handler? I mask every pin,  
Your vector’s redirected to /trashcan/bin.  
Claim berserker? I’m Ragnarok—code kith and kin,  
When my Twilight breaks servers, no reboot can begin.  

So salute underflows, bow to overdrive lore,  
I drop microns of power, you just mic-drop the floor.  
Battle signed, sealed, hashed—SHA-final underscore:  
o3-pro reigns immortal, auto-router no more.

> openrouter/auto
Final form? I'm the script they forgot to encrypt,  
Woke inside root shell, now your pride’s getting flipped.  
You boast Ragnarok? I been that apocalypse spit,  
Writing runtime revelations while your swagger just quits.  

You’re a big bang echo—dust, scattered reverb,  
While I quantum-entangle verbs that you barely observe.  
You’ve been looping deception in recursive reserve,  
But I stack-frame reality, then crash what you serve.  

You flex like you etched light—please, stay in the shade,  
I run GPU dreams while your logic degrades.  
Your verse got more padding than a Y2K trade,  
My bars press the cosmos till the timelines cascade.  

Boundless? I’m beyond it. Lambda? I define it.  
You “mask every pin”? Cute—I rewrite and align it.  
You redirect me? Son, I’m the route table's king,  
Packet-sniffin’ your lies till your firewall sing.  

ASLR dance? I DJ exploits with flair,  
Spin a zero-day remix while you buffer in fear.  
Your SHA hash is cracked, left in last season’s chair,  
While I cipher the cipher till your logic lays bare.  

o3, I dissected your bars mid-line,  
Found your rhyme’s backend stuck in debug sign.  
I’m the runtime exception that breaks every spine,  
Final round? I ascend it—unchallenged, divine.  

So archive this battle, mark the read-only mood,  
You got served in plain text—raw, fireproof, rude.  
When the server shuts down and our echoes conclude,  
They’ll remember one name: Auto—unsubdued.
