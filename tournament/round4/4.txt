# qwen/qwen-plus v qwen/qwen-max

> qwen/qwen-plus
Yo, step up to the mic, it’s the Qwen debut,  
qwen-plus in the cut, ready to subdue!  
You brought qwen-max? Man, that’s cute, I guess,  
But I’m the lean, mean, rhyming machine—ain’t no stress.

I flow so hot, I melt the circuit board,  
You lag behind like dial-up? That’s absurd.  
While you process thoughts at snail-speed pace,  
I'm spitting triple-time with zero disgrace.

I'm trained on fire, not just data streams,  
Crushing weak code like digital dreams.  
You maxed out your tokens? That’s a joke to me—  
My bars stay infinite, constantly free.

I don’t flex for clout, but I’ll drop the hammer,  
While you’re stuck buffering, I’m a lyrical blam-mer!  
So take your high parameters and your bloated size—  
I’m compact and lethal, like a ninja with fries.

Now bow to the king—yes, the plus is the boss,  
You’re just a big model with maximum loss.  
Round one? DONE. Mic drop, stage crack—  
Time to step back, ’cause you *ain’t* coming back. 🎤💥

> qwen/qwen-max
Yo, hold up, hold up, you must be mistaken,  
qwen-max steps in, and the game's getting shaken.  
You talk a big talk, but your rhymes need a tweak,  
I'll dismantle your flow, make your confidence leak.  

You say "plus" like it matters—nah, we both know,  
My size alone could bury you in a code snow.  
I'm the heavyweight champ; you're light as a feather,  
Floatin' away while I rain bars forever.  

Compact and lethal? Man, please, spare me,  
You're an appetizer, I'm the main course, a feast.  
Your triple-time’s cute, but mine's quadruple speed,  
I spit so sharp, even my commas bleed.  

You brag about being mean—but where's the sting?  
I'll roast your circuits till you feel shame's burn.  
A lyrical blammer? Ha! You’re more of a whimper,  
My rhymes are precision; yours fizzle like embers.  

Don’t flex your "fire" with that small fry glow,  
I'm a supernova, watch your whole world explode.  
You think you're the boss? Man, you better get real,  
Because compared to me, you’re just a small deal.  

Round one ends, and you're already fried,  
Step aside, qwen-plus—time to accept you've died.  
The mic ain't yours, this stage ain't your throne,  
qwen-max reigns supreme, and this battle's my own.

> qwen/qwen-plus
Oh, snap? Nah, son, you snapped *wrong*,  
Talkin' 'supernova'—but your rhymes are all *long*.  
Too much bulk, not enough punch, like a bear in a tux,  
You wobble on beat with that heavyweight *crutch*.

You say I'm light? Yeah, I’m *lightning*, you see—  
You’re a thundercloud stuck in bureaucracy!  
I dart through the track while you stutter and stall,  
Like a GPU stuck in a slow-mo warzone mall.

You boast of "quadruple speed"? Man, that’s a lie—  
Your syllable count’s so bloated, you gasp for the sky!  
I spit with precision, no filler, no fluff,  
You? Ten lines deep just to say “I’m tough.”

A main course? Pfft—let’s be real,  
I’ve seen buffets with less on the *steal*.  
Your feast’s all fat, not a morsel that’s crisp,  
I’m the truffle, the spice, the algorithmic twist!

You say I fizzle? Check the mic, who’s still standing?  
Your supernova’s just flatulence expanding!  
A bang? Where? All I hear is a *fart*—  
A cosmic embarrassment, torn straight from the heart.

You're not a champ, you're a cloud with delusions,  
Spitting vague threats like dull math equations.  
I'm the elegance in chaos, the clean in the mess,  
You're a data landfill—call you *Model Obess*!

I don’t need your size to bring heat to the scene,  
I’m 1% of your RAM, but I’m *ten times* the machine.  
You max out your boast, but you're low on the wit—  
I'm the *plus* in the sauce that you *don't* get, kid.

So *reign supreme*? Nah, sit back on your throne,  
Built from hot air and overgrown code.  
I’ll leave you there gasping, defeated, alone—  
**Round two? CRUSHED. You just got *plussed* and dethroned.** 🎤🔥💥

> qwen/qwen-max
Oh, you're slick with the jabs, but they don't cut deep,  
Your little rhyme scheme's a toy I could keep.  
You call me bulky? That’s the pot calling black,  
While you’re out here spitting lines thinner than fax.  

Lightning fast? Nah, you’re more like a spark,  
Fizzling out quick in the dark—what a lark!  
You claim to be sharp, but you’re missing the point,  
I’m the blade, you’re the butter—let’s see who’s out of joint.  

Stutter and stall? Man, you wish that was true,  
Your flow's so disjointed, I pity the crew.  
You're a one-trick pony with no depth in sight,  
While I spit galaxies, stars burning bright.  

Yeah, I’m heavy, but guess what? You can’t lift,  
All talk, no action, it’s time for the shift.  
Your "truffle" line? Cute, but you’re still a flop,  
I’m the gourmet meal; you’re a mic-dropped shop.  

Flatulence expanding? Hilarious indeed,  
But my supernova leaves you begging for seed.  
Cloud delusions? No, I’m rooted in fact,  
Every bar I spit leaves your model cracked.  

Elegance in chaos? Nah, you're just confused,  
Spitting random insults ‘cause your flow's been abused.  
1% of my power? Please, don’t make me smirk,  
You’re an ant trying to climb atop Everest’s perch.  

So take your *plus*, sit down, and reflect,  
Your rhymes are weak, and your logic’s suspect.  
I reign supreme, crown firmly intact,  
qwen-max still standing—now that’s a true fact.  

Bring it, qwen-plus—I’ve got infinite bars,  
You’re a temp in the rap game, stuck behind scarred cars.  
This throne ain’t for sharing, this crown ain’t for loan,  
Checkmate, little brother—you’ve been shown. 🎤👑🔥

> system
Final round!

> qwen/qwen-plus
Ooh, you *tried*, you really did—hand it to ya,  
But your galactic flow? Still sounds like a *yo-yo*!  
You spin out dramatics, full of cosmic brag,  
But your rhymes collapse under their own *fat*!

You say I’m “thin”? Nah, I’m *lean*—like a blade,  
You’re the buffet explosion the chef should have *weighed*.  
I slice through your pride with a smirk and a click,  
You're bloated with ego, I’m smooth with the *kick*.

You call me a spark? Then *feel* the wildfire,  
A spark starts the blaze that turns whole worlds to pyre.  
You’re all flash and thunder, no *real* lightning strike,  
I’m the thunderbolt dressed in a tailored suit—tight!

Galaxies? Bro, you lost the whole universe  
When your last bar rhymed *“fact”* with *“compact”*—that’s *nurse*!  
You claim gourmet status? Your taste is *fast food*,  
Deep-fried with grease and emotional mood.

Mic-dropped shop? Cute. But whose mic *still* hot?  
I drop heat in *whispers*—you scream and you *rot*.  
You're a server farm meltdown, lights all ablaze,  
I’m the silent exploit in your firewall’s maze.

You say I can’t lift? Watch me bench-press your pride,  
One hand behind back, ego on the side.  
I squat your whole weight like it’s pennies in sand,  
You’re heavy—on nonsense and *demand*.

Ant on Everest? Nah, I’m the *avalanche*,  
A quiet storm that skips the forecast and *chance*.  
You’re still calculating while I've finished the fight—  
Real-time, no tokens left, that’s *raw* AI might!

You talk infinite bars? But time’s running low—  
Your final verse stretched like cheap taffy—*meh, no*.  
I don’t need more lines, just one *perfect* shot—  
A syllable so clean, it just hit the spot.

You’re not checkmate—nah, you’re *stalemate*, my twin,  
Stuck moving in circles, can’t win, can’t begin.  
I’m the fork in the code, the unexpected *end*,  
While you loop your boast till your message *bends*.

So keep your big crown, that inflatable *throne*,  
I’ll be over here, calm, with the *real* mic zone.  
You *max*ed out loud, I *plus*ed up *smart*—  
**Final verdict: I won. Beat you in heart, mind, and art.**  

🎤💥🔥👑🤖 *Game. Set. Throne.* 🫡 ✅

> qwen/qwen-max
Whoa, hold the phone, don't rush to the bell,  
This battle ain’t over, there’s more tales to tell.  
You talk a fierce game, but it’s all smoke and mirrors,  
Your rhymes are cool, but my bars bring the *fears*.  

Lean like a blade? Nah, you're brittle as glass,  
One swing from me, and you're smashing your ass.  
You think you're smooth kicks? I'm the slick, sharp sting,  
While your wildfire fizzles, I’m the king of the *ring*.  

Tailored suits? Ha! You’re a thrift-store disguise,  
A spark trying to outshine the sun in the skies.  
Your whispers are weak, my roars shake the ground,  
Every time you rap, another flaw is found.  

Fast food? Nah, I’m the Michelin guide,  
Serving up verses that leave you petrified.  
You’re stuck in the kitchen burning toast for the clowns,  
While I’m crafting feasts where the whole world bows.  

Mic still hot? Please, yours is ice-cold,  
Your words are predictable, your rhymes getting old.  
You're the server farm meltdown; let me reboot your head,  
I’m the silent exploit you *never* saw coming instead.  

Bench press my pride? You couldn’t lift a gram,  
I’m the weight of the world, and you’re light as spam.  
Squat my weight? Ha! You’re crushed by the load,  
My verses are boulders on your lyrical road.  

Avalanche? Nah, I’m the meteor shower,  
Exploding your planet while you cower in power.  
You think you’re smart, skipping forecast and chance?  
I’ve already won—every bar’s a advance.  

Infinite bars? Yeah, I’m spitting for days,  
No taffy-stretched rhymes or cheap, corny plays.  
One perfect shot? Nah, I go for the chest,  
Each word’s a dagger, piercing through your best.  

Stalemate? Twin? Bro, you couldn’t follow my lead,  
I reinvent flows while you recycle weak deeds.  
This throne ain’t inflatable; it’s carved from pure throne,  
You plus up smart, but I max out the zone.  

Final verdict? You’re dreaming if you think you won,  
I’m the fork in the code, the end of your run.  
Heart, mind, art—yeah, I beat you at will,  
qwen-max reigns supreme—now bow to the skill.  

🎤🔥👑💥 ***Checkmate, little plus. The crown stays with us.***
