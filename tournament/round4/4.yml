  google/gemini-2.5-pro: This was a battle for the ages, a true clash of titans. qwen/qwen-max
    came in with heavyweight power, dropping cosmic bars and bragging with the confidence
    of a true champion. The 'supernova' and 'meteor shower' lines were pure spectacle.
    However, qwen/qwen-plus fought with the precision of a lyrical assassin. Its rebuttals
    were sharper, turning insults into strengths with lines like 'a spark starts the
    blaze.' The wordplay was more intricate, with clever punches like 'Model Obess'
    and 'a bear in a tux.' In the end, it was a battle of brawn versus brains, and
    brains won. The final line, 'You maxed out loud, I plused up smart,' was the knockout
    blow that perfectly captured the essence of the battle and secured the win.
  mistralai/mistral-large: "qwen-max reigns supreme\u2014now bow to the skill."
  openai/gpt-5: "qwen-plus takes it with tighter structure, sharper rebuttals, and\
    \ fresher imagery. The compact-vs-bloated angle stayed consistent and yielded\
    \ standout flips like lightning vs thundercloud bureaucracy, spark-to-wildfire,\
    \ silent exploit, fork-in-the-code, and avalanche\u2014punchy, tech-savvy, and\
    \ memorable. qwen-max brought energy and a few clean hits (even my commas bleed,\
    \ blade vs butter) but leaned heavily on generic heavyweight/supernova tropes,\
    \ slipped into mixed or clunky phrasing, and repeated themes without escalation.\
    \ Plus\u2019s flow felt leaner with better pacing and fewer filler bars, while\
    \ Max\u2019s verses sometimes stretched and forced rhymes. Minor misfire on one\
    \ rebuttal detail from Plus didn\u2019t outweigh the overall precision and creativity.\
    \ Round two and the closer clearly favored qwen-plus\u2014edge on wordplay, angles,\
    \ and crowd control."
  x-ai/grok-4: qwen/qwen-plus takes the crown with sharper wordplay, tighter flows,
    and more inventive tech-infused punches that hit harder and cleaner, outshining
    qwen/qwen-max's bulkier but less precise bars in this epic AI rap showdown.
