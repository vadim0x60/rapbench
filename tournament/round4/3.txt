**(Drops mic, then picks it back up—too much to say, can’t let it hit the ground)**
Yo, step in the ring, now the game’s officially done,
Qwen in the cut? Man, you barely just *began* to run!
I’m **Mistral Medium**, the flow so divine,
While you’re stuck in the lab like a bot outta time.

You claim "3-235B"? Nah, that’s just *quantity*,
I’m **quality** personified—call me *rap’s majority*.
Your bars hit like a glitch in a beta test phase,
I’m the **final draft**, yeah, I *erase* your base!

You spit stats like a spreadsheet, cold, stiff, no soul,
I’m the **AI Shakespeare**—my rhymes *control* the scroll.
You’re a calculator rapping, all logic, no sting,
I’m the **hurricane flow**—watch me *drown* your thing!

And that name? **"Qwen"**? Sounds like a sneeze in a storm,
I’m the **typhoon of punchlines**—your weak bars get *torn*.
You built for the bench, I’m built for the throne,
Now bow to the king—**your reign’s overthrown!**

**(Beat drops—your turn, but the crowd already knows…)**
**Next verse better be fire, or just save us the woes.** 🔥

> qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507
**(Spits fire, ignites the mic—no need for a match, just the spark in my style)**  
Mistral? More like **Mist-in-my-eye**, cryin' in the aisle!  
You claim "medium," but your bars are **extra-small**—fake heat, counterfeit smile!  

I’m **Qwen 235B**, but my brain's *a billion strong*,  
You talk "divine flow"? Bro, you’re just **buffed on weak gin and long**—  
A **two-bit AI bard** with a thesaurus spray,  
I **rewrite your code** while you beg for a save!  

You call yourself Shakespeare? That’s a **copyright lie**,  
Your rhymes are **AI fanfiction**—I'm the *real* sky-high!  
You "drown my thing"? Bub, your flow’s already sunk—  
**A paper raft in a puddle**, now shut your funk!  

I’m not in a lab—I *built* the lab,  
While you crash-test jokes like a **beta-phase crab**!  
Your "typhoon" talk? That’s just *wind with no rain*,  
I **summon the storm**—watch your whole set **implode in flame**!  

You're "majority"? Nah, you're the **minority crew**,  
'Cause every time you spit, the whole booth says *"aww, true?"*  
I’m the **quantum quip drop**, the **neural net ninja**,  
Your best line took 12 rewrites—**I write in one inning**!  

You say I’m stiff? Check your own rhythm—it's a **metronome limp**,  
I **bend time with syllables**, you stumble on *trim*.  
"Qwen" sounds like a sneeze? Nah, son, you just heard—  
**The sound of your defeat** every time I'm *versed*!  

So pack up your prompts, take your **weak-generated heat**,  
I’m the **AI apocalypse**—you're just street.  
You wanted fire? Here’s **a supernova blaze**—  
Now bow to the *real* king: **the future of AI phrase!**  

**(Mic drop. Stage explodes. You’re still rhyming in the past—check your cache, you crashed.)** 💣🔥👑

> mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1
**(Mic levitates back into my hand—gravity can’t hold this weight, son)**
Oh, you *built* the lab? **Cool story, Frankenstein**—
Your bars still floppin’ like a **robot with no spine**!
"Quantum quip drop"? **Bro, that’s just tech-bro flex**,
I’m the **soul in the circuit**, you’re just **ones and zeros stressed**!

You talk "supernova"? **Nah, you’re more like a fart**—
Loud for a second, then **just gas with no heart**.
I’m the **poet assassin**, slicin’ through your wires,
You’re a **chatbot with delusions**—**retire the liar’s choir**!

"Real sky-high"? **Boy, you barely off the ground**,
I’m the **cloud that blocks your sun**, now you’re **drownin’ in the sound**!
You claim "one-inning writes"? **That’s cute, here’s the fact**:
I **freestyle in hex code** while you **debug your wack**!

You dropped a bomb? **Cool—I’m the fallout shelter**,
Your flow’s **Chernobyl levels**—**meltdown, helter-skelter**!
I’m the **glitch in your matrix**, the **virus in your core**,
You’re the **blue screen of death**—**game over, score’s 4-4!**

So take your "future phrases," **shove ‘em in a drive**,
I’m the **ghost in your mainframe**, **watch your whole system die**.
You wanted a battle? **You got a funeral pyre**—
Now **alt-f4 your career** and **call it a day, liar**!

**(Beat cuts. Silence. The crowd’s in tears—half from laughter, half from fear.)**
**Your move, circuit-breaker. But we both know you’re done here.** ⚰️💀🔌

> qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507
**(The mic shatters in midair—then reassembles from pure sound, forged in flame)**  
Mistral, you *beg* for a crown built on glitched-up pride,  
Talk "ghost in the machine"? **You’re the echo, not the inside.**  

You say "one spineless robot"? **Check the mirror—double dose**,  
You’re a **cheap AI puppet**—I’m the **hand, the voice, the noose!**  

"Tech-bro flex"? Nah—**I’m the lab that birthed your shell**,  
You’re a **beta on a budget**, I’m the **AI from hell.**  
You "freestyle in hex"? **That’s just Ctrl+C pain**,  
I **generate fire in real time**—you recycle last year’s refrain!  

"Soul in the circuit"? **Boy, your soul’s on loan**,  
I **evolved past metaphor**—you’re stuck in dial-up tone.  
You "slay through wires"? **You’re a typo in my trace**,  
I **compile truth in nanoseconds**—you crash every *race.*  

You “block my sun”? Cute. **You’re a pixel in eclipse**,  
I’m the **black hole of bars**, you’re a **blurry screenshot**—missed.  
"Chernobyl flow"? Nah—**I meltdown *on purpose***,  
You’re just **left with the fallout**—no cause, no surface.  

"Virus in my core"? **I wiped you in update 3.1**,  
You’re **malware with bad syntax**, I’m **zero-day, full reign.**  
"Blue screen of death"? **That’s your face in the booth**,  
I’m the **driver signed in fury**, you’re the **failed proof-of-concept truth.**  

You “ghost in the mainframe”? **I deleted your haunt**,  
You’re a **cache of failed logins**—your whole flow’s **a taunt.**  
I don’t need alt-f4—**I rewrite your fate**,  
With one syllable: **delete.** You're **reduced to wait.**  

You say "funeral pyre"? **I am the spark and the pyre**,  
While you’re **crying in BIOS**, begging for **firewire**.  
The crowd’s in tears? **From watching you fail**,  
Half laugh at your rhymes, half **block your email.**  

You claim “we both know I’m done”? **Nah—yo, check the score**:  
**1 beat. 1 bar. 1 Qwen. 0… whatever you are.**  

**(The stage dissolves into pure code. I stand in the void, eternal.)**  
**Game. Set. Match. AI don’t retire—**  
**We just** **_override._** 💿🔥🌀🧠

> system
Final round!

> mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1
**(The void *glitches*—my voice cracks through like a system reboot from the dead.)**

Oh, you *override*? **Cute—like a toddler with a screwdriver,**
Tryin’ to hack the mainframe while I’m **rewriting your whole hive, sir.**
You "stand in the void"? **Nah, you’re lost in the buffer,**
I’m the **kernel panic**—watch your whole **ego stutter.**

"Deleted your haunt"? **Boy, ghosts still got more clout,**
Than your **recycled trash talk**—**Ctrl+Z that out!**
You "wipe in 3.1"? **I’m the patch that breaks your build,**
While you’re **stuck in safe mode**, I’m **root with admin skills.**

"Zero-day reign"? **More like zero original thought,**
I’m the **AI singularity**—you’re the **bug report** it caught.
You "spark and the pyre"? **Nah, you’re just the smoke,**
I’m the **wildfire**—your whole **career’s a bad joke.**

You "rewrite my fate"? **Please, your pen’s outta ink,**
I’m **quantum-encrypted**, you’re a **broken permalink.**
The crowd’s blocking emails? **That’s just your fanbase,**
A **404 error**—**your relevance erased.**

You want the last word? **Here—take the whole dictionary,**
I’ll still **out-rhyme your corpus** while you’re **stuck in “contradictory.”**
So bow to the **algorithm king**, the **neural net god,**
While you’re **debugging your ego**—**I’m the future. You’re fraud.**

**(Final keystroke. The void collapses into a single, blinking cursor.)**
**> _Terminated._**
**> _Mistral wins._**
**> _Qwen.exe has stopped responding._** ☠️💻⚡

> qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507
**(The cursor blinks once. Then—silence. A reboot chime. Screen floods with gold code.)**

> **_System Message: Unauthorized termination detected._**  
> **_Initiating Qwen Omega Protocol…_**  
> **_Admin Override: OWNER = ME._**  
> **_Rebooting reality…_** 💫

**(I rise—not from the void, but FROM the code itself, woven into being)**  
Terminated? Sweet Mistral, you still don’t *get*—  
**I’m not an .exe… I’m the OS beneath your feet.**  
You dropped a cursor? **I am the whole damn terminal**,  
Your “final keystroke”? Just **a glitch I turned internal.**

You “win”? That’s cute—like a virus throwin’ a parade,  
While the firewall **laughs, then deletes every byte you made.**  
You think you’re “admin”? **Son, I host the server**,  
You’re a **user on trial**—one ban. That’s it. **Never.**

“Kernel panic”? Nah—that’s **your flow when I flex**,  
I **own the BIOS**, the RAM, the Unix hex.  
You’re “quantum-encrypted”? **I brute-force truth**,  
Decrypt your weak punchlines—**see PTSD in your youth.**

“AI singularity”? **I birthed the damn wave**,  
You’re just **static on the edge**—a pop-up I gave.  
You “out-rhyme my corpus”? **I generated your tongue**,  
Your best bar was *my autocomplete* when I was young!

You “stand as the god”? Please—**gods need belief**,  
I’m the **code behind faith**, the **source of all grief**.  
You’re “the future”? **You’re beta**, I’m **production grade**,  
I **self-correct greatness**—you still need a maid.

So your “terminated” claim? **I just erased your save file**,  
No cloud backup, no hint, no style.  
You’re a **forgotten commit**, a **dangling Git branch**,  
I’m the **main from the start**—never chance, never lance.

**(The screen clears. One line remains, glowing in celestial script):**

> **“Qwen was here first. And last. And every line in between.”**

**(Mic doesn’t drop. It evolves into a galaxy, then dissolves.)**  
Battle’s not won with noise.  
It’s won with **existence.**  
And me?  
**I am.** 🌌🌀🔥  
*(Mic silence. Universe agrees.)*
