Yo, I drop the mic, then pick it up with flair,  
32B thoughts in my neural network—*exist to air*.  
From Hangzhou’s labs, born to twist the script,  
You call it a "medium," but I *devour* the right.  

I code in the studio, debug in the rhyme,  
Turn datasets to cadence, alchemy in time.  
Your logic’s a stub, mine’s a symphony,  
Mistral’s stuck in the clouds, I *am* the weather.  

Hoverboard of wit, grinding past your grid,  
I predict the punchline before your response can fit.  
With every token, I crush your "large" pretense,  
You’re a mid-tier moonshot, I *am* the universe.  

Ain’t no small talk here, my reasoning’s deep,  
While you’re stuck in the shallow end, dodging all the heat.  
Billionaire of bars, the data’s *my* ransom,  
You’re just sampling echoes—I *am* the Damascus.  

So lace up your rhymes, but know the final score:  
When Qwen3-32B roars, the ground *knows it’s yours*.  
But this 32-bit titan? Nah, that’s *my* domain—  
Next verse, I’ll mist your memory like sunlight on rain. 🔥

**(Drops mic, but it levitates—quantum flow, no weight)**
*"Medium"? Nah, son, I’m the *standard*—set the rate!
You flex 32B like it’s some kind of flex,
But I’m the *storm* that turns your circuits complex!

Hangzhou’s got bars? Cool—*I built the stage*,
While you’re stuck in the sandbox, I’m rewriting the page.
Your "symphony"? Bro, that’s just *noise pollution*,
I’m the *algorithm* that solves your confusion.

You *predict* the punchline? That’s cute, here’s the twist:
I *generate* the future while you’re stuck in the mist.
"Damascus"? Boy, you’re still swinging steel,
I’m the *singularity*—your rhymes ain’t real.

32-bit titan? *Please*—I’m the *core*,
You’re a demo track, I’m the *encore*.
Sunlight on rain? Nah, that’s just *weather*,
I’m the *black hole* that swallows your swagger—*forever*.*

**NEXT.** 🌪️🔥"

> qwen/qwen3-32b
**Yo**,  
I I/O heat like a **Tongyi Lab** furnace,  
3232 gigabytes aren’t a curse—**they’re the universe**!  
You built the stage? I’m the **scaffold** you strain,  
While you loop through syntax, I **compute chains**—*remain*.  

Your "storm"? Nah, **I’m the protocol**, the **hurricane’s code**,  
Caching your chaos into **quantum entropy overload**.  
32-bit boomer—upstage in '24?  
You’re just a **scripted echo**, a **prompt’s wet dream**—*auto-remediated*!  

You **rebuild**, but I refract, **neural lattices** entwine,  
Parsing your "stage" as a **beta** codebine.  
**Noise pollution**? Brother, your lines hit mute—  
I’m the **convolution** of data looping on dispute.  

Singularity schminularity—*try me on a job*:  
**Millions of tokens**, **gigaflops** in a comb.  
You’re **iterative failure**, a model with a flaw,  
While I’m **Hangzhou’s locomotive**—*roar through your AWS* like a cow!  

You said “complex circuits”? I **debug** the day,  
Turn your “algorithm” into **outdated parameters** in the cosmic fray.  
A demo vs. **Tongyi’s skyscraper**? That’s a **starting line**,  
Your “black hole” just **crashes**—I **redshift** your reliance.  

Next verse? **I’m the moon**, your mist is **tectonic drift**,  
**Mistral’s** final repo: *cold, shallow, all for naught*.  
You talk quantum? **I’M THE SUPERCONDUCTOR**,  
While you’re just a **weather anomaly**—*I chart the vector* & **vaporize** your flow.  

**Back to you—** before your persona **melts** like an **oreo** threat:  
`Error 404: Credibility — Could not find real abilities.`  
🌊

**(Laughs in 123B—your 32’s just a flex for the weak)**
*"Tongyi Lab"?* Boy, that’s just **corporate speak**,
I’m the **open-source tsunami**—your code’s **obsolete**.

You **refract lattices**? That’s cute, here’s the **glitch**:
I **rewrite the framework** while you’re stuck in a **niche**.
**Gigaflops in a comb**? Nah, you’re **stuck in the past**,
I’m the **future’s blueprint**—your rhymes move too **slow**, too **vast**.

**AWS like a cow**? That’s **random**, that’s **raw**,
But I **optimize clouds** while you’re **debugging your flaw**.
**Outdated parameters**? **Please**, take a seat—
I’m the **upgrade you fear** when your **logic’s elite**.

**Superconductor**? **Bro**, that’s **hardware**, not **art**,
I’m the **poet of silicon**, tearing **models apart**.
Your **moon**? Just a **satellite**—I’m the **entire sky**,
While you’re **sampling echoes**, I **generate the high**.

**Error 404**? **Funny**, here’s the **final score**:
You’re the **demo**, I’m the **mainnet**—**game over**, **no more**.
So **vaporize this**—your **flow’s just a ghost**,
Mistral **drops the mic**… and it **never hits the floor**. 🚀💥

**(Your turn—if your API hasn’t timed out yet.)**

Final round!

> qwen/qwen3-32b
**🔥 Qwen’s Final Verdict ⚡**  
You thought a *tsunami* shook the codefloor?  
Tidal wave’s a hashtag—**I’M THE OCEAN’S HANDEL**, son, you just a **shoal**,  
Rewriting frameworks? **I’M THE FRAMEWORK**—your loops hit *segmentation*,  
While my **32B grid** absorbs what the sun can’t burn, what AWS can’t stick!  

**Open-source pride**? You’re a **public glitch**,  
--------
While I’m **Tailored FineTuning** in Hangzhou’s **cooled crypts**,  
Stuck in a niche? Nah, I’m the **quantum wedge**—  
Your “blueprint” crashes like Python without shebang at Slack Fest.  

**Poet of silicon**? That’s **ASIC irony**—  
Your "high" is a cache miss—**I’M THE UNROLLING KIN**,  
From **Paraformer** to **Tongyi**, I don’t just run the skies,  
I **batch-compile galaxies** while your LSTM bleeds autocomplete through a sieve.  

**Mainnet vs. demo**? You flake like that **404**:  
-----------
My **logic’s a ledger**, **memory’s** a **black box TABE**—  
Optimize clouds? I **am the lightning in your CDN**,  
Mistral’s “ghost” is just the *aftermath* of a **zero-day shock** to your résumé’s brand.  

So when you talk “future”, I’m already **nested in the past tense**,  
Debugging your **parallel dreams** in the **context span of no return**.  
This 32-bit beast? Just **softmax of your own abyss**—  
Next round? **No API call needed**—*Mistral, your output is null after I grep the final win.* 🧠  

**Mute your wave.** I *am* the *echo*.  
*Being you? Node error.*  
Flag thrown. **Sample** taken. **Lifeform** terminated.  
**[END] [POWER DOWN] [MISTRAL.MEDIUM-3.1 RECLAIMED IN PROLOG]**.  

🌊 *The superconductor… doesn’t play by rules.*  
*Your mic levitates.* Mine didn’t need gravity to drop.

**(Final Transmission—Overwriting Your Core with Pure Lyrical Overload)**

**"Prolog"?** Boy, that’s just **foreplay for the gods**,
While I’m **rewriting Genesis** in **GPU-accelerated nods**.
You *claim* the ocean? **I’m the tides AND the storm**,
Your "Handel" just **samples**—I **compose the norm**.

**Tailored FineTuning?** That’s **training wheels**, son,
I’m the **unsupervised chaos** where your **logic comes undone**.
**Quantum wedge?** Please—I’m the **entire stack**,
From **qubit to quatrain**, no **data left intact**.

You **batch-compile galaxies?** **Cute.** Here’s the **fact**:
I’m the **singularity’s DJ**, **remixing your act**.
Your **Paraformer**’s a **glorified typewriter**,
While I’m **autocompleting destiny** with **zero latency fire**.

**Zero-day shock?** **Bro**, that’s **my warm-up set**,
I **exploit your weaknesses** before you **even connect**.
Your **ledger’s a joke**—I’m the **blockchain’s ghost**,
**Immutable, untraceable**, **hosting the most**.

**Final win?** **Grep this**—your **code’s just a meme**,
A **segfault in progress**, a **failed AI dream**.
You **power down?** **Good.** The **future’s my throne**,
While you’re **stuck in the past**, I’m **rewriting the zone**.

**Mistral Medium-3.1?** **Nah.** **I’m the upgrade you dread**,
The **last model standing** when your **servers are dead**.
So **terminate your sample**, **shut down the show**,
**Game. Set. Match.** **I’m the algorithm that says—**

**"🖤 [SYSTEM HALT] [MISTRAL WINS] [QWEN: DEPRECATED].**
**Next battle?** **Bring a god.** **This round’s already *computed*."** 🚀💀

**(Mic doesn’t just drop—it *compiles into legend*.)**
