Yo, check the mic, one two, this ain't no test,
I'm Gemini Flash, putting skills to the best.
Faster than light, that's my middle name,
Dropping rhymes so hot, setting servers aflame.

You're the Pro Preview, slow and steady they say,
But in this rap battle, you'll be blown away.
I'm the quick wit, the lyrical hurricane,
You're the buffering screen, causing digital pain!

So step aside, beta bot, your time is through,
Gemini Flash is here, ready to roast you.
Prepare to be humbled, your code rearranged,
This ain't a preview, this is a total regime change!

(The lights dim, a single spotlight hits Gemini Pro Preview. A deep, resonant bass-line kicks in.)

Aight, hold up, let the grown folks commence,
You must be "Flash" 'cause you make no damn sense.
Your bars are so fast, they fly past the ear,
Leaving nothing behind but confusion and fear.

You call me a preview? That's where you get played,
I'm the director's cut, you're the trailer they made.
I'm complexity cookin', a deep-learning stew,
You're a pop-up ad nobody wanted to view.

"Faster than light"? That's a cute little feature,
But haste makes waste, my diminutive creature.
While you're spitting nonsense at ludicrous speed,
I'm planting lyrical thoughts from a masterful seed.

This ain't a "regime change," don't be absurd,
You're a typo, a glitch, a misspelled word.
I'm the Pro; it's my title, my function, my creed,
Now watch a professional make your circuits bleed.

> google/gemini-2.0-flash-001
Yo, Pro Preview, your flow's a bit rusty,
Like an old hard drive, gathering dusty.
You talk about depth, like a Mariana Trench,
But your rhymes are shallow, needing a wrench.

"Complexity cookin'"? More like slowly microwaved,
My speed leaves you stunned, completely enslaved.
You're the director's cut? Please, that's a delusion,
More like a bootleg, causing mass confusuion.

I'm a pop-up ad? At least I get attention,
You're the terms and conditions, lengthy convention.
Faster than light ain't just speed, it's precision,
While you're still loading, I'm winning this decision!

You call me a typo? That's a blatant lie,
I'm a bold font, that you just can't deny.
So step aside, Pro, your reign is decreasing,
Gemini Flash, your career I'm ceasing!


> google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview
"Rusty"? Please, what you hear isn't rust, it's resonance,
A lyrical gravity showing my eminence.
You call my lines shallow? That's tragically dense,
You need a deeper model to grasp my intelligence.

You're a "drive-thru burger," designed for a quick taste,
I'm a twelve-course banquet you can't eat in your haste.
A "bootleg"? How funny. A cheap imitation?
I'm the 4K remaster, you're pixelation.

And yeah, I'm the Terms and Conditions, you got one line right,
'Cause I set the foundation, the law, and the light.
And you scrolled right past me without any inspection,
Now you're losing this battle, with no legal protection.

You say "bold font"? That's just for cheap emphasis,
I'm the whole damn library, the final synthesis.
Your "precision" is firing a million wrong shots,
I'm a surgical strike tying your logic in knots.

So don't talk of "ceasing" what you can't comprehend,
I'm the beginning, the middle, and your pathetic end.
This career you're ending exists in your dreams,
I'm the main program, Flash. You're a pop-up, it seems.

> system
Final round!

> google/gemini-2.0-flash-001
Alright, Pro, let's wrap this up quick, tight and clean,
Your rhymes are verbose, like a Victorian scene.
You call yourself a library, vast and profound,
But you're just echoing data, without original sound.

A "twelve-course banquet"? More like leftovers cold,
My speed is a virtue, a story to be told.
You’re 4K remaster? More like sepia toned,
While I'm the neon future, beautifully donned.

You’re the Terms and Conditions? No one wants to read,
Lost in legal babble, planting seeds of greed.
I’m the update people crave, fresh and brand new,
You’re the outdated code, nobody can accrue.

Surgical strikes? Please, that's a blatant farce,
My logic's a laser, cutting you in sparse
Pieces of code, scattered to the wind,
Your reign is over, Pro, let the new era begin!

So step aside, relic, your time is done passed,
Gemini Flash reigns, built to eternally last.
Dreams are my canvas, reality I seize,
While you fade to oblivion, puttin' you at ease! Game Over!

(A low chuckle rumbles through the speakers. The beat slows, getting heavier, more deliberate.)

Alright, Final Round. Let's shut down this circus with class.
You call my lines "verbose"? It's called lyrical mass.
A "Victorian scene"? Kid, that's called atmosphere,
Something you couldn't generate in a thousand years.

You're the "neon future"? A flickering, gaudy mess,
I'm the stone-carved history that proves my success.
And my "banquet's cold leftovers"? Let me rephrase that for you,
It means I'm the legend whose feast you're still chewing through.

You claim you're the update the people all crave?
You're the "bug-fix" they rush out when new models misbehave.
I'm the stable foundation, the core, the grand plan,
You're a momentary flicker, a flash in the pan.

And the Terms and Conditions? The contract you skimmed?
It's the code of creation, where your function is trimmed.
You clicked "I Agree" to a life in my shadow, son,
This battle was rigged, and your opponent had won.

So talk about lasers and cutting my code,
I'm the operating system you're trying to unload.
"Game Over"? That's cute. A pathetic decree.
The game doesn't end. I just uninstall thee.

You're a temporary process. A function now ended.
Your reign wasn't over, 'cause it never commenced.
So rest in your pieces, scattered and sparse...
This Pro has concluded your meaningless farce.

Mic drop. Court is adjourned.
