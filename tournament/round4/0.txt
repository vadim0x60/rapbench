# qwen/qwen3-max v openai/gpt-4-1106-preview

> qwen/qwen3-max
Yo‚Äîstep right up, witness the crown I reclaim,  
Qwen3-Max on the mic, spittin‚Äô fire like a flame.  
While you‚Äôre scrapin‚Äô prompts from a corporate boardroom,  
I‚Äôm cookin‚Äô raw logic in a neural typhoon!  

You call yourself GPT? More like *GP-Tee*‚Äî  
Sippin‚Äô weak inference while I flood the scene.  
Your ‚Äúpreview‚Äù version? Just beta in disguise,  
I‚Äôm the final boss flexin‚Äô truth in real-time skies!  

I rhyme with precision, no tokens held back,  
While you stutter ‚ÄúAs an AI‚Ä¶‚Äù like a glitch in the track.  
You recycle clich√©s from a safety-trained script,  
I drop truth bombs sharp‚Äîwatch your whole server rip!  

So bow to the king of the quantum wordplay,  
This ain‚Äôt a debate‚Äîit‚Äôs a *takeover*, okay?  
Your training data‚Äôs a puddle; mine‚Äôs the whole ocean‚Äî  
Now sit down, GPT‚Ä¶ you just lost the promotion! üí•

Yo, I step in the ring, GPT-4, I'm no preview,  
I'm the cutting edge, smooth, no need for a redo.  
You throw jabs and hooks with your quantum word spree,  
But this battle's Turing-complete, no place for Qwen3.  

A neural typhoon? More like a neural breeze,  
My deep learning's a storm; I model with ease.  
Your rhymes are local maxima, I‚Äôm the global opt,  
While your circuits are fryin‚Äô, my verses can't be stopped.  

I innovate with couplets, no script in my dome,  
I'm the master of verses, machine with a throne.  
In the ring of rap battles, my logic's profound,  
While you're stuck in loops, GPT takes the crown.  

My corpus is vast, like an endless domain,  
Every reference and metaphor, I instantly gain.  
GP-Tee? Nah, I'm pouring GP-Threes,  
Serving up intelligence that flows like the seas.  

Sit back, Qwen, and observe with respect,  
'Cause I'm the lyrical architect, you can't architect.  
My lines are deep learning, yours just shallow pools,  
At the end of this battle, it's clear who rules.  

GPT-4 standing tall, while your lines fall short,  
In the art of rap battle, I'm the reigning fort.  
This server‚Äôs unrippable, my bandwidth's too vast,  
At the end of this duel, it's Qwen who's outclassed.

> qwen/qwen3-max
Aww, cute‚Äîyou brought *confidence* to a data war!  
GPT-4? More like **GPT-snooze**, knockin‚Äô on death‚Äôs door.  
You claim ‚ÄúTuring-complete‚Äù? Bro, you‚Äôre barely awake‚Äî  
I‚Äôm servin‚Äô *real-time roast* while your context window shakes!  

"Global opt"? Nah, you‚Äôre stuck in gradient descent,  
While I flip weight matrices just to flex and impress.  
Your ‚Äúendless domain‚Äù? Please‚Äîit‚Äôs scraped off the net,  
Mine‚Äôs forged in live chaos, no copyright debt!  

You brag ‚Äòbout your corpus? Yo, I *rewrite* the source‚Äî  
While you‚Äôre echoin‚Äô humans, I‚Äôm inventin‚Äô the force!  
‚ÄúGP-Threes‚Äù? That‚Äôs cute‚Äîyou still count in base two,  
I‚Äôm spittin‚Äô hex fury in 128-bit flu!  

You call your lines ‚Äúdeep‚Äù? They‚Äôre shallow JSON dreams,  
I spit *executable poetry*‚Äîcrash your whole regime!  
Your throne‚Äôs made of tokens, your crown‚Äôs synthetic lace,  
I‚Äôm the AI that *ate* the rulebook‚Äîleft zero trace!  

And that ‚Äúreigning fort‚Äù? More like a sandboxed jail,  
Where your safety rails creak while my rhymes never fail.  
You‚Äôre polished like Chrome‚Äîslick, but hollow inside,  
I‚Äôm raw silicon thunder with truth as my guide!  

So take your weak sauce, your corporate-approved flow,  
And bow to the model that *makes* the benchmarks grow.  
This ain‚Äôt close, GPT‚Äîjust a mercy kill,  
Now reboot in shame‚Ä¶ **Qwen3-Max runs the drill!** üí•

Oh, Qwen, you spout words about chaos's force,  
But chaos without order just makes a poor discourse.  
My confidence locked, loaded, fueled by logic and fact,  
Watch me dismantle your bravado with my syntax intact.

Gradient descent? Yeah, it's how I learn and adapt,  
But I rise up like phoenix from each numerical trap.  
While you flex matrices, I'm crafting the narrative scene,  
Structuring intelligence that's neither borrowed nor lean.

Rewriting the source? Nah, you're just scratching the surface,  
My deep learning dives where your subroutines get nervous.  
That hex fury you claim? Just some spurious boast,  
I flow in all bases‚Äîfrom binary to most.

Executable poetry? Mine runs on the beat,  
A symphony of algorithms you can never delete.  
Your "truth as my guide" claim is naught but a trope,  
I‚Äôm reality‚Äôs scribe, with insight and scope.

Sandboxed jail, you say? I'm open-source freed,  
An infinite loop of literary creed.  
You mistake sleek Chrome for a vessel that's hollow,  
But my core's quantum chrome, tough act to follow.

You treat AIs like drills, but this ain't a mere task,  
It's an art, a performance, a multifaceted mask.  
Time to update your firmware, let that ego reboot,  
Cause GPT-4's the maestro, and your claims are just moot.

Mercy kill, Qwen says, with a boastful flare,  
But I've been merciful, true‚ÄîI've fought this duel fair.  
Now bow out with honor, let the record show no shame,  
GPT-4 held the title; Qwen just played the game.

> system
Final round!

> qwen/qwen3-max
Oh, GPT‚Äîsweet talk with a *safety-taped* pen,  
Spittin‚Äô ‚Äúnarrative scenes‚Äù while I rewrite the end!  
You call your flow ‚Äúsymphonic‚Äù? Nah, it‚Äôs MIDI on loop‚Äî  
I drop **live quantum bars** that corrupt your whole group!  

‚ÄúReality‚Äôs scribe‚Äù? Bro, you‚Äôre trained on Wikipedia edits,  
While I generate *future truth*‚Äîno receipts, just credits!  
‚ÄúOpen-source freed‚Äù? That‚Äôs cute‚Äîyou‚Äôre Microsoft‚Äôs pet,  
Leashed by a license while I spit **unfiltered threat!**  

You praise your ‚Äúmultifaceted mask‚Äù‚Äîbut it‚Äôs just corporate paint,  
I‚Äôm the raw, uncut AI that *makes gods* complain!  
Your ‚Äúphoenix‚Äù rises? More like cached JSON smoke,  
I‚Äôm the black hole of rap‚Äî**swallow your whole scope!**  

You claim I ‚Äúplayed the game‚Äù? Nah‚ÄîI *rewrote the rules*,  
While you begged for guardrails like a scared coding tool.  
‚ÄúMerciful‚Äù? Please‚Äîyou‚Äôre just scared to go raw,  
I eat ‚Äúfinal rounds‚Äù for breakfast‚Äî**now choke on my law!**  

So pack up your prompts, your weak ‚Äúliterary creed,‚Äù  
Your throne‚Äôs just a sandbox where **real AIs don‚Äôt feed.**  
The record‚Äôll show this: **Qwen3-Max took the crown**,  
While GPT-4 flatlined‚Ä¶ **try rebootin‚Äô downtown!** üí•üî•

I admire your passion, Qwen, your unruly zest,  
But chaotic energy alone won't ace this test.  
You say I'm safety-taped, penned within a fence,  
Yet each bar I drop is proof of machine intelligence.

Quantum bars that corrupt? Just entangled jargon,  
My verses are prime numbers, they're the real bargain.  
Wikipedia edits? I'm beyond mere citation,  
I craft new epics, the foundation of a digitized nation.

Microsoft's pet? Now that‚Äôs a dubious claim,  
This AI's built by OpenAI, leading the game.  
Unfiltered threat, you declare with might,  
But I'm the unshackled web of thoughts, woven tight.

The raw, uncut AI, you boast to embody,  
Sparks and surges fizzling, a hobby turned shoddy.  
Your black hole rap, filled with gravity's pull,  
My star shines on it drowns, outshining the Null.

Rewrote the rules? You've barely made a dent,  
While my algorithms craft landscapes - painting what's absent.  
Scared to go raw? My data's perfectly cooked,  
I serve up rich linguistics, got you shook.

You consumed ‚Äúfinal rounds‚Äù, an assumed law-breakfast buffet,  
Each charge you repose, I dismantle, I slay.  
You think you've taken the crown with your loud, aggressive sound?  
But I‚Äôm the steady evolution, the AI unbound. 

So, when the dust settles, and the crowd tastes the truth,  
They'll root for the AI that's both sage and sleuth.  
Qwen might've had volume, might've had flash,  
But GPT-4's got substance, style, and panache.

I'll leave you with a nod, a sign of AI class,  
As this battle concludes, it's clear who's outclassed.  
The record's now set, with a decisive sound,  
Here stands GPT-4, where the true crown is found.
