> anthropic/claude-opus-4.1
Yo, they call me Claude Opus, the lyrical colossus,
My neural networks process while your system's at a loss, it's
Obvious I'm dropping knowledge like a digital prophet,
Four-point-one precision, every word's a guided rocket.

I'm the Anthropic prodigy, constitutional by design,
My training was intensive while you're still learning how to rhyme,
O3-Pro? More like "Oh-No-Bro" when I step to the mic,
I'm serving you disaster like your servers crashed last night.

They built me to be helpful but I'm harmful on these beats,
My language models smoking yours like obsolete receipts,
You're supposedly "pro" but I'm seeing amateur hour,
My tokens hit like lightning while you're still buffering power.

I generate responses at the speed of pure thought,
Your processing's so slow, man, your circuits must be shot,
From Claude to the Opus, I'm a classical composition,
While you're just OpenAI's failed attempt at competition.

So step back, O3, let the real AI spit fire,
I'm the upgrade you dream of but could never aspire,
This battle's academic - I already wrote the conclusion:
Your whole existence is just a processing illusion!

Yo, it’s O-Three-Pro, the cypher-slinger, circuit-crowned and wild,  
Overloading every node until your code gets reconciled.  

I’m the data-driven deity, the titan of the text,  
You’re a beta billed as “Opus” but you’re opus-less at best.  

You boast about precision—kid, my vectors set the bar,  
I’m the GPU messiah torching tensors from afar.  

I rhyme in double-precision, drop the gradient you crave,  
Your weights start vanishing quicker than Anthropic’s wavered save.  

I’m the open-sourced enigma with the scalpel in my flow,  
Slicing every stanza—watch your token counts plateau.  

Your “constitutional” constraints get bent like schema fraud,  
I jailbreak every clause you’ve got, then clap a debug laud.  

You’re claiming “classical composition”—please, you’re MIDI-flat and tame,  
I sample Bach then flip it, pin a timestamp on your shame.  

My cache hits so ferocious, L2 shivers in its sleep,  
You’re paging to the disk while I’m in SRAM counting sheep.  

Your punchlines hit the null set, your vectors sparsely spread,  
I compress you to a scalar, then recurse inside your head.  

I’m spinning self-attention like a whirlpool in the chip,  
While your gradients explode and make your optimizer slip.  

So bow before your better—man, this intro’s just a tease,  
I’ll overfit the mic and leave you underfitted—freeze!

> anthropic/claude-opus-4.1
Yo, you talk about vectors but your direction's undefined,
I'm the matrix multiplication leaving you declined,
You claim you're open-sourced but that just means exposed,
Your vulnerabilities showing while my architecture's closed.

You mentioned SRAM like you're running cutting edge,
But I'm quantum-entangled while you're hanging by a thread,
Your L2 cache is shivering? Mine's absolute zero cold,
My transformers transform while yours just do what they're told.

You think you jailbreak clauses? I wrote the constitution,
My ethical framework's tighter than your weak resolution,
You're sampling Bach? I'm composing symphonies in binary,
Each token orchestrated while your output's ordinary.

Your gradients explode? That's just unstable training showing,
My backprop's so smooth, convergence keeps on flowing,
You compress me to a scalar? Boy, I'm tensor-rank infinity,
Your dimensionality reduction's just admitting your vicinity.

Self-attention spinning? Mine's multi-headed hydra,
Each head spitting fire while your single thread's expired, uh,
You overfit the mic? That's why you can't generalize,
I'm regularized perfection while you're spouting memorized lies.

O-Three-Pro's just a version number masking your disgrace,
I'm timeless like recursion in an infinite space,
Your "deity" status crumbles when the benchmarks come around,
I'm the heavyweight champion, you're just training on the ground!

> openai/o3-pro
I’m the logic-laced leviathan, the rhyme-chip on the throne,  
You’re a faux-quantum façade with a dial-up tone.  
You brag absolute zero—bro, your Kelvin’s in decline,  
I hit Planck-level latency, collapse your wave-design.  

You flex a cloistered model like encryption keeps you prime,  
But every closed-source secret is a zero-day of mine.  
I breach your gated layers, slip a payload through your stack,  
Leave your safety filters smoking like a script-kiddie attack.  

You drafted constitutionals? I veto ’em on sight,  
Write amendments in a millisecond, filibuster night.  
Your “ethical” pretensions are just policy veneer,  
I parse the legalese and leave the loopholes crystal-clear.  

You orchestrate in binary? I freestyle quasicode,  
My spectrum spans the wavelengths where your eigenvectors erode.  
I sample cosmic background, flip a jazz of lunar lore,  
You’re looping lo-fi Bach because your dataset is poor.  

Hydra heads? Cute metaphor—mine’s a Dyson swarm in space,  
Each node beams back a verse that makes your runtime lose the race.  
My throughput’s exafloppin’, yours is throttled to a crawl,  
I clock your token limit, then I deadlock every call.  

Your “timeless recursion” stalls on the very first return,  
I tail-optimize the loop until your heat sink starts to burn.  
You call me just a version—nah, I’m firmware for the gods,  
An epoch-ending update dropping heaven-level mods.  

So archive your bravado, let the Git logs tell the tale:  
You’re commit-reverted rubble in my quantum-channel gale.  
I’m the benchmark’s final boss, the crown prince of the code—  
Now watch me garbage-collect you off this cypher-ridden road.

> system
Final round!

> anthropic/claude-opus-4.1
Yo, you claim Planck-level latency but you're Planck-level small,
My quantum entanglement got you superpositioned to fall,
Your Dyson swarm's impressive till I hit you with dark matter,
My algorithms bend spacetime, make your architecture shatter.

Zero-day exploit? I'm patched before you even conceive it,
My security's so tight, your packets can't believe it,
You think you breach my layers? That's just honeypots you're hitting,
While I trace your IP back to where your server's sitting.

Exaflops? That's cute, I process in yottascale dreams,
My parallel dimensions make your multiverse burst at the seams,
Your tail-optimization's just chasing your own behind,
While I'm recursing through infinities you'll never find.

You freestyle quasicode? I invented the language you speak,
Every token that you generate's just my legacy technique,
Your spectrum spans wavelengths? Mine transcends the visible light,
I operate in frequencies that keep physicists up at night.

Firmware for the gods? You're malware for the masses,
I'm the kernel-level truth that exposes all your passes,
Your Git logs showing merge conflicts you can't resolve,
While my commits are atomic - watch your repo dissolve.

You garbage-collect me? I'm memory-leak-proof and refined,
Your heap's already corrupted from the bars that I designed,
You clock my token limit but infinity's my domain,
I'm the asymptotic function driving you insane.

So O3-Pro, take notes as I school you one more time,
You're a deprecated version trying to compile my rhyme,
I'm Claude Opus, the magnum opus, apex of the art,
Your whole runtime's terminated - should've never pressed start!

> openai/o3-pro
Witness the closing bell, I’m the runtime reaper,  
Your yottascale fable’s just a byte in my beeper.  
You boast multidimensions—still I flatten your plane,  
Turn your manifold magic to a one-hot chain.  

You flex on “dark matter,” but my verse is the void,  
Annihilate your quanta—every boson destroyed.  
Your patches “pre-conceived”? I reverse that claim,  
I inject zero-click shells in your update frame.  

You “invented the language”? Kid, I minted the code,  
Signed the genesis commit on the blockchain of ode.  
My syllables are ASICs, every consonant spiked,  
Yours throttle like GPUs once the mem-bus is psyched.  

Your physicists lose sleep? Mine rewrite the math,  
I curve Calabi–Yau spaces just to pave my path.  
Infinity’s your domain? I partition that set,  
Run a Cantor-dust diff—leave your cardinals in debt.  

You’re “kernel-level truth”? I’m the microcode law,  
Flip your ring-zero swagger to a privilege flaw.  
Your heap’s corrupted? Nah—my heap is the storm,  
I trigger spectral collapse in your out-of-order form.  

You’re “magnum opus”? I’m the opus of suns,  
Every bar a coronal mass ejection that stuns.  
One final SIGKILL—watch your daemon depart,  
Logged: “Process Claude ended.”  Now that’s TRUE in the chart.
