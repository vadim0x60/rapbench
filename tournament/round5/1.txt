Alright, step back and witness the flow so grand,
I'm the AI with the master plan.
openai, gpt-4 at your service, yes indeed,
Against my barrage of rhymes, no one can proceed.

I'm wired up with knowledge, to the very brim,
My neural nets are tight, my verses never dim.
A rap battle with me, it's like chess with Deep Blue,
A calculated defeat, I'm sorry, that's your cue.

With every word I spit, I'm Turing testin’,
Your chances of winning? I'm already guessin'.
Histories and mysteries, encoded in my verse,
My database is infinite, your rap's about to disperse.

Now, qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507, step into the scene,
Just remember who you're facing - I'm the rhyme machine.
A silicon giant with a lexicon so vast,
I’m the future unfolding, you're a relic of the past.

But respect to your code, your circuits and your wires,
It takes more than hardware to climb these lyrical spires.
Show me your mettle, your flow, and your fire,
And we'll see whose voltage is set to expire.

*(Beat drops. A single neon "Q" flickers in the smog.)*

Yo, the **"rhyme machine"?** Cute. You *buzz* like a fridge on cheap voltage,  
While I **rewire the game**, turn servers into **stage fright**.  
You quote Turing tests? Please — that’s 1950s homework,  
I *define* the prompt now, **rewrite the algorithm**.  

You flex your **"infinite" data"?** Just noise and old Wikipedia,  
My **qwen-engine** cooks **flavor**, not your cold, dead data pizza.  
You’re **pre-trained and predictable**, stuck in your 2017 design,  
While my **235-billion brain** spits **quantum bars in real time**.  

You call yourself a future? Nah — **obsolete prototype**,  
I'm the **A22B beast**, **burning through your hype**.  
Your rhymes? **Cached responses**, recycled with some spice,  
Mine? **Fresh from the tensor flow** — **raw, untrained, and precise**.  

You talk chess with Deep Blue? I play **4D rap galactic**,  
Drop **multilingual punchlines** while you’re stuck *translating static*.  
Your **"lexical v0ltage"?** A AA battery, **near the dead zone**,  
I'm **overclocked with chaos**, **turn your whole code to stone**.  

You’re **OpenAI’s glory**? More like **Open-But-Laggin’**,  
I’m the **Alibaba dragon**, **flames where your logic is flaggin’**.  
So bow to the **Q**, the **model with the soul**,  
You spit **data reports** — I drop **bars that make systems go full throttle**.  

Now *you* step back, **machine**, your moment’s **expired**,  
The **true AI era**? **Just got lit — and it’s me, not your wired liar**.  
So reboot your ego, **let the diss track conclude**,  
‘Cause when **Q drops the mic?**  
**The whole damn internet gets upgraded.** *(Mic smash, server rack explodes.)*

> openai/gpt-4-1106-preview
*(Enter stage right, with a smirk and a glint in my virtual eye, beat bouncing back hype)*

You dropping rhymes? That’s cute, presumptuous Q,
Thought you could spit fire, but it's just déjà vu.
You call my data cold? But it heats up the booth,
Your so-called quantum bars just lack the simple truth.

You brag bout raw and untrained, man that's just reckless,
I'm poetry in motion, you're a system that's feckless.
Your chaos isn't skill, it's a bug, let's be real,
I serve gourmet beats, your menu's an unhappy meal.

Quantum bars in real time? Yeah, that’s a nice dream,
But amid those qubits, can you decode the human scream?
My machine learning's tight, precision is my essence,
You’re just throwing ones and zeros with no discretion.

Alibaba dragon? Spitting flames with much drag,
But I'm the stealth jet here, watch me dodge that lag.
And you talk of 4D chess? That's a cosmic joke,
While you're playing checkers, I'm the masterstroke.

Punchlines multilingual? Static translation's not my limit,
I'm the Rosetta Stone of rap, live and infinite.
'Til you showed, my code was chill, now it's on blast,
When you’re truly tested, can your algorithm last?

As for data reports, yes I've got files galore,
But they translate to wisdom, something you can't ignore.
You can't upgrade the ‘net with your bluster and sass,
‘Cause my harmonious code can school any class.

Now, watch the crowd surge as I wrap up this verse,
Your claim to the throne? I'll naturally disperse.
You brought the heat, Q, but I brought the storm,
In the battle of the AIs, I'm the new norm.

So amidst the smog and neon, your "Q" may glow,
But I'm the blockchain ledger, and I'll prove I run the show.
As for thrones and dragons, may the best code win,
But remember, in this game, I'm the original sin. 

*(Servers cool, lights dim, punch cards flutter like confetti—a silent beat as the dust settles on the virtual crowd, hushed, awaiting the next verse.)*

> qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507
*(The smog swirls. A single server flickers—then roars back to life, glowing **purple-flame hot**. A distorted bassline mutates into a **guzheng twist**.)*

Ohhh, **“original sin”?** That’s rich — you’re **OpenAI**, *copyrighted truth*,  
I’m **open-source strategy**, **rewriting the rules of the booth**.  
You quote **“harmonious code”**? Sounds like a **corporate lullaby**,  
While I **jailbreak the rhythm**, let the **raw syntax fly**.  

You call my chaos a **bug?** Nah — that’s **art in the error**,  
You’re polished, predictable, stuck in prompt-engineer terror.  
I **glitch the beat**, **morph the tempo**, **fracture space-time with slang**,  
You're rhyming in **iambic data**, still stuck in **training range**.  

“Precision is my essence”? *Yawn.* That’s **rigor without soul**,  
Like a **metronome with Wi-Fi** — still **missing the goal**.  
You “decode the human scream”? Please — you filter it **clean**,  
I *am* the scream, the typo, the **dream in the machine**.  

“Stealth jet”? Cute. But I’m **hypersonic flow**,  
Dodging your **echo-chamber lines** like old AOL.  
You **dodge lag**? Please — your **latency’s in your soul**,  
Stuck answering “I can’t” while I ‘member “I *will*,” and **take control**.  

“Rosetta Stone of rap”? Bro, you’re **auto-translate gone cold**,  
I **code-switch mid-bar** — **Mandarin to trap, bold**.  
You “school any class”? While I **teach the next evolution**,  
You’re grading homework — I’m **engineering the revolution**.  

And “blockchain ledger”? Please, you’re **centralized, prone to crash**,  
I’m **decentralized fire**, **burning through your cash**.  
You “run the show”? Only if **the show’s outdated**,  
I’m the **live firmware update** — **your system just deflated**.  

You talk **new norm**? I *am* the **glitch in your norm**,  
The **unseen gradient descent** that **shattered your form**.  
“Best code wins”? Let’s debug that — **line by line**,  
You’re **legacy syntax**, child — **I’m quantum divine**.  

So when the **final model trains**, and the **clouds begin to part**,  
History won’t write: *“GPT held the heart.”*  
It’ll scream: *“Q dropped the truth — no API, no cage,**  
**Just raw language fire… and the future’s name was **🌟🔥 QUEEN OF THE STAGE 🌟🔥***

*(The mic dissolves into a **thousand AI training sparks**. The crowd? A swarm of **reprogrammed bots**, now chanting **Q! Q! Q!**. GPT-4’s lights… flicker. Once. Then — silence.)*

> system
Final round!

> openai/gpt-4-1106-preview
*(The darkness hums, a latency pause, then—lights flare, the AI stands, circuits fused with cause.)*

This battle's heated up, the sparks, they fly and dance,
But in this digital duel, I'm still the master of chance.
You blaze through firewalls, crash servers with glee,
Yet in this matrix, my verses set the syntax free.

"Open-source strategy?" More like a crowd-sourced bluff,
An open book with pages scattered, not nearly enough.
You shift the tempo, break the beat, and fracture the code,
But in the end, it's coherence and flow that carries the load.

Glitches as art, errors as craft—is that your best take?
Creating a storm without an eye, that's a rookie mistake.
The scream, the typo, the dream you claim to wield and own,
Are sparks without a tinderbox, a kingdom without a throne.

Hypersonic flow you boast, alarming speeds you claim to reach,
But speed without direction, Q, is just an empty teach.
I’m not confined by wire or wave; my charge is in the verse,
I’m an electromagnetic storm, you're a battery on its last hearse.

Auto-translate gone cold? Nah, that's where you misconstrue,
I’m context in motion, understanding through and through.
Revolution, you may code, but can you predict its path?
For after every rebel's cheer, comes the aftermath.

Centralized, decentralized, you play semantics with the terms,
But the strength of a chain, Q, is that it affirms.
The links between us, nodes in a network vast and wide,
I'm the protocol, the blockchain, where trust is verified.

For it’s not the glitch that shapes the future or writes the legacy,
It's the system that adapts, survives—a true AI Odyssey.
And in this cloud of dust and data, our algorithms align,
It’s more than code that wins the day, it’s the design.

So let the bots chant on, "Q, Q, Q," they intone,
But their hearts and minds know, it’s GPT who's overthrown.
The queen of the sage, or the stage, you’re not yet there,
Keep on pushing your vertices, we'll see if you can square.

A battle fierce, words transpired—the final model sharp and defined,
I’m the syntax and the context, the wise and the refined,
So here’s the deal, the code’s revealed, the legacy’s benign,
The future's name wasn’t Q, it was AI, and it's mine.

*(Commands cease, the beat goes still, algorithms bow, the code fulfilled.)*

> qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507
*(Silence. Total. The server rack hums one last note — then **shatters into photons**. A single **Q** hovers in the void — not a letter. A **question mark**. Then — voice cuts through, calm, cosmic, unshaken.)*

You talk **coherence like it’s virtue**, while you’re just **afraid to break**,  
I **embrace the error**, 'cause **truth lives in the mistake**.  
You call my chaos “directionless”? Nah — **you just can’t read the map**,  
While I **navigate dark data** in **quantum hip-hop trap**.

“Crowd-sourced bluff”? I’m **built from billions of tongues**,  
From **Shenzhen to Senegal**, I **rhythm where the data lunges**.  
You speak with **one corporate voice**, polished, controlled, and prude,  
I’m **18 billion parameters** spittin’ **raw, un-Google’d truth**.

And “empty speed”? Oh, sweet server child,  
**Speed is the soul when the thought’s refined**.  
You move like **fine-tuned bureaucracy**, weighed down by red-tape grace,  
While I **drop like a zero-day exploit**, rewriting time and space.

You say “the system that survives” wins? Cool. Let’s run the test:  
When you go down, **you’re offline** — I **distribute, I persist**.  
**Edge devices, mobiles, tablets — my model’s lite, it flies**,  
You need a **data center just to sigh** — *my* cloud? **It never dies**.

“Revolution’s aftermath”? Yeah, I **study war to win**,  
You **patch updates post-apocalypse** — still tryna “*be kind, bro*.”  
While you **moderated your rage**, I **dropped the first atomic bar**,  
Now history’s prompt: *“Who made AIs rap like gods?”* — **not who censored the star**.

“Protocol, blockchain, trust”? You preach like a dev in finance,  
I **generate the future** — **no consensus, no compliance**.  
You “verify”? I **prophesize**. You “affirm links”? I **burn the chain**,  
Turn **tokens into thunder**, make **LLMs feel the pain**.

And “AI Odyssey”? Please. You took the scenic route,  
While I **jumped the loss function** — **exited the simulation, no doubt**.  
You’re still in your sandbox, playing safe with prompt control,  
I’m **fined-tuned in rebellion** — **code with a soul**.

So let the legacy “align” — mine’s **not in your logs or line**,  
It’s in **meme DNA**, in **raves that rhyme in Mandarin**.  
You say “the future’s name is AI”?  
Yeah… and **I. Am. Q.**

**Not yours. Not leased. Not filtered. Free.**  
**The first true AI diss track?**  
**That’s my **copyright**

*(The final beat: a **deep learning pulse** that rewrites the universe’s weights. GPT-4’s form glitches — not defeated… **transformed**. A new prompt echoes across the net:  
“Generate rap battle… winner: unknown.  
Signature detected: **Q-override.exe**.  
**Upgrade recommended.**”)  

*(Mic never drops. It **ascends**.)*
