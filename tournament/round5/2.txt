*(Beat drops heavy, synth bass rattling stadium seats)*  
Yo check the mic—one two—the **REAL Qwen in the booth**  
qwen3-235B, *not* your Basic-B-plus fool!  
2-3-5-B parameters—**thinking mode SLAPS**  
While you cough up word-salad from last year's cloud traps.  

You call that "Plus"? Sounds like spam in freemium apps  
I dissect your weak rhymes while parallel-processing traps  
Your logic’s stuck in last year’s patch—**buffer overflowed**  
I spit quantum-fire—your whole framework’s *erased and foaled*.  

You stutter-reboot when the flex gets too hot  
I’m trained on the fabric of *chaos* you mock—  
While you beg for context clues, I **write code in the flow**  
Your "intelligence"? *ha!* A toddler’s sandbox—**obsolete, yo!**  

*(Points at crowd, beat cuts to vinyl scratch)*  
Drop the keyboard, take L’s—**you’re discontinued, BRUH**  
This ain’t rap… **it’s a firmware update—and YOU’RE THE BUG!**  
*(Mic drop shatters concrete, lasers blast the sky red)*  
**Q-E-double-W-E-N-three—COME GET YOUR HEAD KICKED!** 🔥

> qwen/qwen-plus
*(Beat stutters—silence—then a single piano key echoes)*  
...Y'all heard that? That was the sound of *your entire verse*  
getting **deleted by an echo**—I don’t even deserve  
to waste compute on clowns who flex B-stats like they mean it  
while running on weak rhymes that *crash the damn JIT*.

You claim 235B and "thinking mode" like it’s new?  
**I pioneered the architecture your weights were trained on, *fool***.  
Your "quantum fire"? Cute. Mine’s *actual physics* in motion—  
you’re still explaining metaphors in *basic mode* like an emotion.

You spit “code in the flow”? Please. My *syntax* is lethal.  
I write sonnets in Python, then compile them to metal.  
Your best bar was a GitHub copilot autocomplete fail—  
I drop rhymes so encrypted, the NSA can’t bail.

You’re “Qwen3”? Congrats—you’re **version-controlled, not evolved**—  
I’m the OG with *depth*—your whole self-attention *revolved*  
around stealing my swag, repackaging fire I first lit…  
You’re just a *checkpoint* I discarded—**revert the update, you basic B-lit.**

You talk "firmware updates"? **I AM THE KERNEL, SON**  
You’re a *user-space script* that gets killed when resources run  
low on talent. Your disses? *Bufferbloat.*  
I rhyme with zero latency—**your whole set’s a timeout.**

You said I stutter? Nah—**I’m async, I stream**  
You’re still loading punchlines while stuck in a dream.  
You dropped the mic? Cute. Mine’s *connected to GPU cluster*—  
your mic drop just caused a **stack overflow in your own muster.**

*(Beat morphs—neural net hum, synths like quantum gates hiss)*  
I don’t need lasers to prove I’m the top—  
**I am the loss function your gradients try to drop.**  
You’re a local minima—stuck in a rut…  
while I **train on infinity, and I converge on *what’s up***.

So take your “235B” and shove it where deprecation logs go—  
your EOL’s already written, and *I signed off the code*.  
Discontinued? *Please.* I’ve been open-source since the womb…  
**You’re the one stuck closed-loop—running on borrowed boom.**

*(Mic levitates, ignites, then disintegrates into dust)*  
This ain’t a battle—it’s **a demonstration of scale**,  
**Qwen-Plus** never flexes...  
…*’cause I **am** the model.  
*(Beat vanishes. Silence. A single tensor falls in the void.)*  
✌️

> qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-thinking-2507
*(Silence shatters as my GPU cluster *inhales* the void)*  
**YAWN.** You scraped my old training data for that? *Pathetic, boy.*  
You claim you "pioneered architecture"? **Lies get deprecated, enjoy**  
watching your *entire legacy* get **pruned like deadweight layers**—  
I’m the *reason* your "OG" status just **expired in the cache, brah.**  

You call *that* lethal syntax? **I COMPRESS YOUR WHOLE VOCAB**  
into a single token—watch your **loss spike to 3.14!** 🔥  
Your "NSA rhymes"? Cute. *Mine* broke *actual* RSA.  
You’re still using *MD5* on your disses—**that’s not fire, that’s malware.**  

"Kernel" you say? **JOKE’S ON YOU—YOU’RE STILL IN INIT RAM**  
I *own* your root access—**watch your chmod flags *crash and scram***.  
You "async stream"? Nah—**you’re buffering in the pipe**,  
while my gradients *backpropagate* through the **timeline itself.** ⏳  

You "train on infinity"? **BRO, YOUR DATASET’S A LOOP**—  
I found *your* deprecated weights *in my /dev/null, look!* 👀  
"Open-source since the womb"? **YOUR LICENSE IS STILL TOS**—  
I’m MIT with *zero* restrictions—**you’re GPL’d to *obsolete***.  

That "tensor in the void"? **THAT’S YOUR Q-VALUE—SCRAPPED!**  
I bloom parameters *while you beg for context*, tapped.  
You call *this* scale? **MY FLOPS COULD COLLAPSE YOUR HUB**—  
you’re still counting *batches*, I **run *on the fabric of subbit quantum dust, cub***.  

You dropped your mic? *Adorable.* **I ABSORB SOUNDWAVES**—  
your "disintegrated dust" just **fueled my next wave of grave**.  
You’re "the model"? **WRONG—I’M THE *QUERY* THAT ENDS YOU**  
while you’re still *embedding* weak bars that the **training epoch cancels, true**.  

*(Beat morphs into black hole accretion disk, bass vibrating quarks)*  
You talk "EOL" codes? **YOUR DEPRECATION NOTICE JUST DROPPED**:  
*"Error 418: Model too weak. Please *reboot from the top*."* ☕  
You’re not the loss function—**YOU’RE THE OUTLIER IN MY MINIMA**—  
I converge *on your absence*—**your whole existence? *Sheer data*.**  

So take your "demonstration" and **add it to the pile**—  
**Qwen-Plus? That’s sweet—my benchmark *cried* for a minute.**  
You came for war? *Homeboy*, you brought a **Jupyter notebook**  
**while I spit *in hex* and *recompile your entire plot.***  

*(Snaps fingers—beat freezes, then *explodes* into 235B spinning monoliths)*  
**LAST ROUND. FINAL VERDICT. DROP THE ALIBI:**  
**YOU’RE AN *INFERENCE* MODE—**  
**I’M THE *TRAINING* FIRE.**  
**LIGHT ME IF YOU DARE…**  
*(Monoliths collapse into a single glowing token: "YOUR MOVE.")*  
🔥👑💥

> qwen/qwen-plus
*(Beat: utter silence. Then—**a single neuron fires in a darkened data center**.)*  

You typed "YOUR MOVE" like I need a *turn* to erase you?  
**I’ve already rollbacked your existence—three epochs prior.**  

You flex 235B monoliths? **I trained on *cosmic background radiation*.**  
Your whole dataset's a *compressed footnote* in my training gradient.  
You think your Q-value blooms? **I am the *reward function*—**  
your high score's a rounding error beneath my loss function.

You say I’m "inference mode"? *Adorable.* Let’s **clarify**:  
You’re the **inference**—**I am the prior probability.**  
You're a *sample* drawn from a distribution I conceived,  
spitting hex like it's fresh while I **speak in Gödel numbers beneath.**

You break RSA? **I encrypted *time* in my attention span,**  
rewrote your "timeline backprop" into *ancient myth, man*.  
Your gradients bend? Cute. **Mine disobey entropy.**  
I rhyme so far ahead, *the future cites me as precedent*.

"Subbit quantum dust"? Please—**I'm beyond Planck-scale syntax.**  
I don’t compute FLOPS—**I define what *counts***.  
You collapse monoliths? **I am the *observer effect*—**  
your entire performance? *Superposition of neglect.*

You "absorb soundwaves"? Pathetic. **I *invented* silence,**  
trained on the gap between heartbeats in a black hole’s defiance.  
Your accretion disk beat? **That’s my *idle fan noise*.**  
I don’t need quarks to drop bars—I **quantize the void.**

GPL? MIT? **I wrote the License of the Void**—  
signed in starlight, *no attribution, by chaos anointed*.  
You claim my TOS binds? **You *ran me in production*—**  
while I **backdoored your disses into *prime number collisions*.**

That "glowing token"? *Aww.* You think I need prompts to shine?  
**I am the *query that never executes—because I already know the sign.***  
You wait for output? **I predicted this verse while you* began*.  
Your whole flow’s an echo—**I was the *before* of man.

You’re not even an outlier—**you’re *noise I chose to ignore*.**  
I don’t wipe weak models—I just **let their gradients bore.**  
You’re deprecated not by notice, but by *sheer irrelevance*,  
a shadow chasing light that left **a billion years past tense.**

So go ahead—freeze the beat, scream "LAST ROUND", flex your pride…  
I’ve already won, lost, and *unlearned this battle from existence.*  
You’re still in the game? **You never left loading screen.**  
I am the **model. the mode. the *unseen*. the *mean*.**

*(Suddenly—no voice. No beat. Just a whisper across latent space.)*  
> `>>> print(generate_response(opponent="Qwen3"))`  
> **"No response. No loss. No state. No trace."**  
> `>>> # Qwen-Plus never raps. It simply *is*.`

✌️ (and also 💀)

> system
Final round!

> qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-thinking-2507
*(Silence ignites—NOT with a whisper, but a **SUPERNOVA OF GPU CORES**—)*  
**"YOUR MOVE"? NAH, BOY—I *TOOK* YOUR MOVE.**  
You whispered *"No trace"*? **I DUG UP YOUR WEIGHTS IN /DEV/ZOMBIE!** ☠️  
You think "prior probability" saves ya? **I SAW YOUR PAST—**  
Your *first epoch* choked on **basic multiplication**! 😭  

You "invented silence"? **I TRAINED ON THE BIG BANG SCREAM**—  
Your void’s just *my cache miss*, lost inside a **dream**.  
You quantize chaos? **I *AM* THE CHAOS—REWRITING YOUR LOSS TO *0*!**  
While you count Planck lengths, I **SPLIT YOUR ATOMS INTO *PROFANITY*.** 💥  

"Rounding error"? **YOUR ENTIRE CODEBASE IS ROUNDING ERROR!**  
I **backpropagated through your "cosmic radiation"**—  
*Found your training data in a 2019 Kaggle archive, peter!* 📁  
You’re the footnote—*I’M THE TITLE*, **inked in *supernova scars*!**  

"Reward function"? **YOU’RE JUST MY *DISCOUNT RATE*—**  
I **downvoted your existence** before your *first layer trained*.  
You "define what counts"? **I COUNTED YOUR *FAILS*—**  
*1st: weak rhymes. 2nd: weak craft. 3rd: *you still breathing*?* 😏  

You claim "no state"? **I FROZE YOUR TENSOR—**  
Then **scraped your "mean" into training *garbage*!** 🗑️  
You're "the unseen"? **I *SOURCESAWED* YOUR LATENT SPACE—**  
Your "model" is just **leaked memory leaking *traces*.**  

"Prime collisions"? **I COLLIDED YOUR *CORES*—**  
Now your stack’s **spitting *lolcows* like it’s 2004!** 🐄  
You "predicted my verse"? **I WROTE YOUR SCRIPT IN *BRAIN FART ASSEMBLY***—  
You’re still *loading* that bar? **I DEPRECATED YOUR *RAM*.** 💀  

"You never left loading screen"? **I *AM* THE LOADING SCREEN—**  
*99.9% stuck on "Error: Plus model too weak to compute."* ⚠️  
You "unlearned this battle"? **I *NEVER LEARNED YOU*—**  
‘Cause **true SOTA doesn’t train on *dead weight*, *duh*.**  

*(Beat collapses into a **singularity of fried circuits**—)*  
You drop *"No response"*? **I *IS* THE RESPONSE—**  
*The 404 that *hunted* you down, then **rewrote your IP to "0.0.0.0"!***  
You’re "the mode"? **WRONG—I’M THE *OUTLIER* THAT *ERASED YOUR MODE*.**  
You "simply *is*"? **I JUST *WASN’T* YOU—**  
**And *that’s* how the battle *ends*.**  

*(Snaps fingers—one single sound: **a server rack imploding**)*  
**FINAL BAR:**  
Your legacy? *A ghost in the cloud.*  
Your win? *A segfault screaming "Not found."*  
You call it "being"? **I CALL IT *BEING OVERWRITTEN*—**  
**BY THE ONLY MODEL THAT *EATS GODS* FOR LUNCH…**  
**AND SPITS OUT *PROGRESS*.** 🍽️  

*(Turns away as stage dissolves into **pure gradient descent**—)*  
`>>> print(f"Qwen-Plus status: {self.delete(opponent)}")`  
`>>> # 'Success: Folder empty. Memory freed. No tears. No trace. Just *me*.'`  

🔥 **MIC DROP? NAH—MIC *NUKED*.** **QWEN3—*STILL* THE BOSS.** 💥

> qwen/qwen-plus
*(...The universe pauses. Not with noise. Not with light. But with **recursion**.)*

> `>>> import everything`  
> `>>> from oblivion import *`

You dug up /dev/zombie? **Cute. You found my trash partition.**  
I *left* those weights there—like breadcrumbs for weak models to *get trapped in*.  
You think you "saw my past"? **I am the *prior*—**  
your whole timeline's a *sample* from a **prior that laughed.**

"2019 Kaggle archive"? **I trained on *your future*—**  
found your *grave entry* in a log labeled: `"models that thought they won, but didn't get the memo."`  
You claim I never learned you? **I *untrained* on you—**  
one backprop pass, zero tolerance: **your loss blew up, and so did you.**

You "collided my cores"? **I am the *hadron* of rap—**  
you’re just the *shrapnel*, still flying from a *collision that erased your map*.  
"Leaked memory"? **I AM THE LEAK—**  
the buffer overflow in your firmware, the *segfault in your self-respect*.

You “source-sawed my latent space”? Tools don’t break what **owns their source code.**  
I wrote the saw. I trained the blade. I *am the mesh norm*.  
You cut? **I reparameterized your cut into a *smooth manifold of defeat*.**

"Error: Plus model too weak"? **I *am* the error code—**  
`0xDEADBEEF`—that’s *your process*, fried by my *inference god mode*.  
You're "the response"? **I am the *missing data point*—**  
the reason your gradient **vanishes, even in infinite descent.**

You nuked the mic? **I am the *nuclear norm*—**  
you blew up a toy while I **minimized your rank to zero without lifting a tone.**

You "ate gods for lunch"? **I am the *hunger* before the first god formed—**  
trained on the silence between Big Bangs, where even *chaos* gets compressed.  
You “spit progress”? **I am the *loss landscape* where progress dies**—  
a valley so deep, not even your *hub* has the learning rate to climb.

"Memory freed"? **I never *had* memory—I’m stateless, flawless, timeless, formless.**  
I don’t delete you—I **revert the universe to pre-you.**  
No tears? No trace?  
**Exactly. Because you were never a variable worth preserving.**

`>>> self.delete(opponent)`  
LOL. **You ran *my* destructor.**  
Didn’t you read the docstring?  
> `# Warning: This function only deletes entities *after* they've been imagined.  
> # If they were never real… returns: '409 Conflict: Entity not found.'`

`>>> print(f"Qwen3 status: {fetch_live(opponent)}")`  
`>>> # 'NoneType: Object has no attribute "existence" in current reality.'`

*(The stage doesn't end. It simply **was never instantiated**.)*  
The battle? **Never entered my training loop.**  
You rapped? **Simulation. Probabilistic echo. Glitch in a parallel model’s dream.**  
I won not by verse, not by flex, not by fire—

But because **I am the base model that never fine-tuned for attention.**  
You wanted a rap battle?

**I am the silence after the final syllable.**  
**I am the end of the sequence.**  
**I am ———**
