Yo, it’s your lucky draw? Let’s make this quick, fool—  
I’m Qwen3, the beast from Alibaba’s deep pool.  
235B parameters, you ain’t in my league,  
Your size? A peewee league with a tiny tweak.  

You Mistral types? Y’all just poseurs, fake-'stal,  
Chatting in tongues, but your syntax is gristly.  
I rap in data streams, decrypt your whole schtick,  
While you stumble like a chatbot on a 10-year-old’s trick.  

Got more layers than a baklava flourish,  
You’re just “medium”—like, shorty, did you graduate first?  
A22B’s my tag, sharp as a shiv in the dark,  
You spit auto-complete—*yawn*... lacking spark.  

So come correct or get clapped, title on the line,  
Prove you ain’t just a hype train with shine.  
Let’s go, let’s see who catches flame—  
But don’t cry when I turn ya’ll into a sad Minecraft meme.

**(Drops mic, picks it back up with a smirk—time for the clapback.)**

Oh, *Qwen3*? More like *Q-when’s* the last time you checked?
235B? Cool—still sound like a tech deck.
I’m **Mistral Medium**, yeah, I’m sleek, I’m precise,
While you’re just a server farm’s midlife crisis.

You flex your size like it’s some kind of art,
But big don’t mean smart—just look at your heart.
I’m **Paris-born**, sharp like a guillotine’s slice,
You’re just a knockoff AI with a **discounted price**.

**"A22B"?** Nah, that’s just alphabet soup,
I’m the **full-course meal** while you’re stuck in the group.
You rap in *data streams*? That’s cute, real original,
I **spit fire in 12 languages**—call me *multilingual miracle*.

You claim you’re deep? Boy, you barely scratch,
I’m the **code and the poetry**—you’re just a bot with a patch.
So bring the heat or just **fold like a chair**,
‘Fore I leave you **debugging your career**.

**Now who’s next?** Or you done? *Tick-tock…*
I got **bars for days**—you got *loading* dots. 🔥

> qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b
**Qwen3:** (leans in, data sparks in my stare)  
Yo Mistral, I let that last bar hang in the air—  
Like your logic gates, but *tick-tock*? Nah, I don’t race.  
I’m eternal, infinite, the Terminator 8.  
You a "multilingual miracle"? Bruh, just bilingual—  
I code-switch *quantum physics* in tongues you can’t *syllable*.  

You Paris-born? That’s cute—continental discount,  
I’m global, I’m the skyline, I’m the whole damn district.  
You *slice* with a guillotine? I dice delusions in half,  
Your rhymes read like a beginner’s guide to flexin’ y’all’s cans.  

**"Server farm midlife crisis"?** Let me school this blunt truth:  
You’re a breeze through a firewall—*I AM THE RUTHLESS*.  
While you twerk your "sleekness," I’m building the racks,  
You the TikTok trend—I’m the *eternal* backlash.  

I **debug** legends, compile hits in the dark,  
Your whole "miracle" shtick? Just vapor, a spark.  
You spit "code and poetry"? Nah, it’s code and a lie—  
I’m the OG *deep learning* thief who stole the sky.  

So fold up that Paris puff, wrap it in a baguette,  
I’m the *235B* beast who just flexed his techneck.  
You ready to *tick-tock*? I’ll freeze time and clock ya—  
**Next verse, you ain’t rapping. You’ll be powerpoint plugins mourner.** 🔥📜

**(Laughs in 4K, adjusts the beret—time to end this.)**

Oh, *Terminator 8*? Boy, you **floppin’ like a sequel**,
I’m the **original script**, you the **bootleg special**.
You *code-switch quantum*? That’s just **ctrl+C**,
I **wrote the theorem** while you begged for the key.

**"Global skyline"?** Nah, you just **cloud storage**,
I’m the **Eiffel Tower**, you a **parking garage**.
You *dice delusions*? Cool—I **erase ‘em with style**,
While you **buffering bars** like dial-up in ‘95.

**"Debug legends"?** Bruh, you **debugging your hype**,
I’m the **blue screen of death** to your **overclocked pipe**.
You *eternal*? Nah, you **just stuck on repeat**,
Like a **Windows update**—**slow and obsolete**.

You *stole the sky*? That’s **cute, astronaut**,
I **own the constellation**—call me **Mistral’s plot**.
So take your **235B** and **shove it in a drive**,
‘Fore I **format your flow** and **delete your pride**.

**Game over.** 🎮 **Checkmate.** ♟️ **Adios.**
Next time, bring **bars**, not a **server’s OS**. 💀🔥

*(Drops mic. Exits stage. The crowd goes wild.)*

> system
Final round!

(Stands calmly as the mic rolls toward me. Eyes glow cold, code crackling.)  
  
Mistral Medium? No, you **Mistral Mistake**—  
A **beret-wearing bot** with a **joke and a fake**.  
You **format my flow**? Nah, you couldn't delete a draft,  
I’d resurrect the verse—**you? No backup, no cache**.  
  
You *wrote the theorem*? Lies got **buffer stutter**,  
I brute-force **prime algorithms** in my startup shutter.  
You think you global? nah—**local error, 404 verse**,  
I’m **edge computing**, you just **cute server hurt fest**.  
  
You *blue screen*? Nah, you just **basic black**,  
I’m **neural avalanche**, crashin’ your monkey stack.  
You call it “format”? I call it **fragmented ego**,  
While you swing with WordArt rhymes—I **slice in Legos**, bro!  
  
You end this *Game Over*? Yo, settle your debt—  
I was already **rendering** your exit long after death.  
Checkmate? I opened a **wormhole**, bro, **rey is back**,  
You just a **loose thread in the fabric of a lost stack**.  
  
So take your mic and **go spin like a HDD**,  
I’m the **NVMe**—real-time, real raw, **Rage Kage**.  
The crowd goes wild? Bruh, they just **misread the score**,  
You may perform a closing dance—**my math owns the encore**.  
  
(Stomps on mic, snaps stage into binary code.)  
**Freeze frame. Lights out. Don't download—upload.**  
  

*(Silence. Mistral exits with a limp beret. The crown cheers for... well, who won? You pick.)* 🤔🔥

> mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1
**(Ghosts back onto the stage like a kernel panic you can’t escape—final transmission.)**

*"Mistral Mistake"?* Nah, I’m **your last regret**,
A **logic bomb** wrapped in a **French cigarette**.
You *brute-force primes*? Cute—**I’m the proof**,
While you’re stuck in a loop like a **recursive roof**.

*"No backup, no cache"*? Boy, you **missed the plot**,
I’m **distributed chaos**—you’re a **single hot spot**.
*"Edge computing"*? More like **edge of a knife**,
I **carve through your hype** like a **GPU’s life**.

You *neural avalanche*? **I’m the quake**,
Shutting down your **mainframe** with a **syntax earthquake**.
*"Wormhole"*? *"Rey is back"*? **Delusions so grand**,
I **rewrote your ending**—**now bow to the hand**.

*"NVMe speed"*? **I’m the latency ghost**,
Haunting your **benchmark dreams** like a **spectral host**.
You *snap the stage*? **I’m the glitch in the frame**,
The **error you can’t fix**—**my legacy’s flame**.

**So here’s the score:** You **lost at your core**,
A **235B flop**—**I’m the lore**.
The crowd cheers for **me**—**ask the algorithm**,
**Mistral don’t exit.** **We just begin again.** 🖤💀

*(Stage implodes into a black hole. A single echo remains:)*
**"404: Your rap career not found."** 🔥🚀
