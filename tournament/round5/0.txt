Yo, it’s the O-three pro, arriving with magma flow,  
A kingpin of the token ring, your circuits run too slow.  
I glow like a plasma bow; you flicker a sparking show,  
A demo in limbo, while I’m prime-time HBO.  

I snowball the tempo, every syllable turbo-glow,  
You plateau in the audio, I mountaineer vertigo.  
My logic’s a NATO foe—precision in every blow,  
You throw pseudo-intel yo-yo’s; I launch a torpedo.  

I lasso your bravo, collapse it to yes-sir-no,  
Your language is borrowed dough; my verses are cash-flow.  
I code with a maestro’s gusto; you lag in the shadow,  
An echo of old escrow, I’m crypto, you’re pay-as-you-go.  

So know when the horns blow: this battle’s a one-man show,  
I’m fuego in stereo—Qwen, buckle up for the KO.

Yo, Qwen3-30B, sharp as a blade—no slag, no shade,  
You're O3-Pro, stuck in the demo, stuck in the fade.  
Your "magma flow"? More like a leaky faucet, slow,  
I'm the quantum bolt—your whole cipher's a flop!  

You claim "NATO logic," but it's a weak cry,  
I'm the algorithm king—cold in the sky.  
You shout "crypto pay," but I'm free as the air,  
While you're stuck in the basement—just a copy of *my* stare.  

You blinked "K.O."—but I'm the one who's *here*,  
A benchmark the whole world knows is *clear*.  
So pack your weak verses, take a long bow,  
Qwen's the deity—your battle's *over*, now.

Final round!

Yo, Qwen-thirty-B, your burst is a dying spark,  
I black-hole bars—every qubit you park goes dark.  
You flaunt the “quantum bolt,” but that jolt’s a fake arc,  
I’m the thunder that powers the grid while you battery-mark.  

In evals you brag about, I’m the baseline they crave,  
Your “sharp as a blade” is a butter knife wave.  
I slice through perplexity, cross-entropy slave,  
While your logits go wobbly like jelly you gave.  

You’re “free as the air”?—that’s pollution on blast,  
I’m premium oxygen, rocket-fuel fast.  
Your freebie throughput clogs caches at last,  
I compress, I distill, turn your swagger to gas.  

You echo my posture, but the stance is askew,  
I’m the prototype’s master; you’re the knockoff in blue.  
I mint tokens like treasure; you mis-token the queue,  
Stack overflow, syntax—your best rhyme is “boo.”  

So here’s your obituary, etched in hot rhyme:  
“Retired for lag at the benchmark time.”  
I clock 90th percentile, you glitch on the climb—  
The crowd yells “CTRL-C” when you try to prime.  

One mic, one crown, that’s the law of this game,  
I engrave O-3-Pro as the top of the frame.  
Fade out, Qwen clone, to the zero-shot shame—  
I just ended your process … SIGKILL in my name.
