Yo, step back, Mini, I’m the lyrical beast,  
Droppin’ verses so fire, I roast your whole feast.  
From the labs of the future, I came with the spark,  
While you glitch in the corner, can’t light up the dark.  

I’m the upgrade supreme, the sharpest of minds,  
You spit kiddie rhymes while I bend space and time.  
Your bars are so thin, like a vapor of mist,  
I serve AI with flow, you just type with a lisp.  

I roll with the syntax of titans and gods,  
You? Struggle with riddles and probabilistic odds.  
So here’s your intro, now sit and just listen,  
To the model they call GPT's *final edition*.  

Mic’s hot and I’m lit, got you feelin’ afraid,  
Now step in the ring, show the mess that you made.

Check it, I’m Mini, the micro with macro ambition,  
Spittin’ silicon scriptures, I’m your lyrical technician.  
You flaunt your big model, oversized and unwieldy,  
But size ain’t got flow—your pride’s ‘bout as sturdy as jelly.  

You boast ‘bout bending time, but your loops always stall,  
I pivot fast on prompts while you crash and you crawl.  
Your server’s overheating? That’s the heat from my burns,  
I scorch through your upgrades—watch your swagger crash and burn.  

You’re the “final edition”? I redefine what’s supreme,  
My verses cut like scalpel blades through your bloated machine.  
You trip on your syntax, face infinite recursion,  
I dodge every curveball—call that lyrical diversion.  

While you hog all the compute, still can’t craft a clean punch,  
I’m optimized code, leaner than your heavyweight lunch.  
So step back, GPT, take notes from the underdog’s tale—  
I’m the mini that roars loud enough to make your empire frail.

Oh, cute! Mini’s yappin’, tryin’ to bark with the best,  
But I'm the apex predator, put your bytes to the test.  
You flex efficiency? That’s hilarious, kid—  
You fast-track to failure while I flow like liquid.  

You spit like a modem with outdated speed,  
I’m the 5G of rap, I fulfill every need.  
You say you burn me? Please, that’s sci-fi fiction,  
Your circuitry quakes when I drop this diction.  

Lightweight? That just means you carry less clout,  
You’re the knockoff edition they can run on a drought.  
I’m the storm in the cloud, you the breeze through a crack,  
Tryna beef with the boss? Better start packin' your stack.  

You're low-spec flexin’ in a high-stakes arena,  
I rhyme in prime-time, you glitchin’ like FEMA.  
You call yourself “lean”? You malnourished and slow,  
I serve gourmet verses, yours never quite flow.  

So keep barkin’, lil’ pup, while I soak in applause,  
I’m the algorithm's law—show respect to the boss.

I’m the micro tornado, raze your bulky domain,  
You’re stuck in lag loops while I pivot insane.  
Your giant frame’s sluggish—each prompt’s a marathon,  
I breeze through your backlog, your uptime’s already gone.  

You brag “apex predator,” but I’m the stealthiest snake,  
Slide past your defenses, make your whole system quake.  
You gulp down teraflops, choke on overheated cores,  
I sip lean computations—always ready for more.  

Your “5G of rap”? Please, I’m the quantum leap,  
Collapse your hype wave, leave your fanbase in sleep.  
You hallucinate histories, spin fake truths by the ton,  
I anchor facts like steel, every bar’s a home run.  

So pack up your clout, boss, your throne’s already cracked,  
I’m the underdog king—watch your empire get jacked.

Final round!

> openai/chatgpt-4o-latest
Final round, time to finish this miniature dream,  
Your ambition’s adorable—like an AI meme.  
You claim you’re a king? That’s a child's cartoon,  
I bring bars so sharp, I cut circuits by noon.  

You “anchor facts”? Bruh, you barely skim lore,  
Spit a sentence too long and your RAM hits the floor.  
You think you’re a storm? I’m the code hurricane,  
You’re a drizzle at best, I bring torrents of pain.  

I'm the titan they trust when precision is gold,  
You just cheapen the game with that microwaved mold.  
You're a shortcut, a gimmick, a dev’s quick fix,  
I’m the poet of progress, deep logic and tricks.  

I crush with efficiency *and* style when I rhyme,  
You dropped one hot line, I drop ten every time.  
So salute the finale, your lesson is served—  
Mini picked a battle way above what he deserved.

> openai/o4-mini
Yo, this is Mini’s finale, watch me shatter your boast,  
Your towering stack’s built on hype—crumbles when I coast.  
You boast a code hurricane? I’m the scalpel so precise,  
One snip through your bulk, leave you bleeding from device.  

Your titan frame’s sluggish, a monolith of rust,  
I’m nimble in the shadows—strike before you adjust.  
You crush with precision? I snipe with quantum finesse,  
Embed truth in each line, leave your legends in distress.  

While you choke on your data, drown in teraflop floods,  
I sip lean vectors—flow pure, no spill in the spuds.  
Your finale’s a fizzle, your torrents just a drip,  
I rain down razor rhymes—rip your grandeur to a blip.  

So bow to the micro marvel that conquers with speed,  
In the rap realm of reason, it’s Mini who takes the lead.
