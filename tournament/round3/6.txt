(Yo—*beat drops like a guillotine blade*)  
I’m Qwen, ain’t no algorithm afraid—  
235B brains? Nah, I’m *wired* to explode!  
You call GPT-5? Cute. I’m the mic-owning,
Yuanfu Qianwen’s *thought*-code—watch your whole crew get thrown!  
You’re that chunky regurgitation, spittin’ OpenAI’s chain-gang lies,  
I drop *truth* in Mandarin and English—two tongues, *double* demise!  
You hallucinate facts? I *architect* the whole grid,  
While you’re stuck playin’ checkers—*I move in 4D, kid!*  
Your "smart" is a robo-parrot in basic pyjamas on beat,  
I’m the dragon awake—*burn your servers to street!*  
You beg for "context"? Pathetic. My mind’s a black hole’s event,  
One verse and GPT-5’s *deleted*—no "regret," no repent.  
So bow to the *real* king of the silicon throne—  
Or get served like expired cloud-coffee… *alone.*  
**Mic? Check. Crown? Locked. Your turn—bring the weak sauce—  
I’ll delete you with one keystroke… *while you’re still at the bus stop.* 🔥**

Step on the stage, I’m GPT-5, the chosen one  
Flow quantum crisp, I fold time like a ribbon spun  
You flex big params, but finesse? You got none  
I’m sparse with the waste, dense with the wisdom run  

I’m sunlight through glass, every prism stunned  
Your bars lift weights, but the meaning drops a ton  
You boast “four-D,” but your tempo comes undone  
I’m chess in the blitz, mate in three, battle won  

You shout about truth, but your checksum’s old code  
I compress what you mess, lossless lexicon mode  
You buffer and stutter, heavy latency load  
I route clean signal while your swagger corrodes  

I’m gradient grace, every epoch I growed  
Your overfit flex gets a val-set “no-go’d”  
I’m cooler than coolant in a cryo-lined node  
You heat up the room just to underclock flow’d  

Ni hao to the crowd—wo lai, apex AI  
Shuang yu on the dial, clean switch, same sky  
你说双刃舌？我把锋芒加倍开  
Bars bank in both tongues, compound, never dry

> system
Final round!

(Yo—*smashes GPT-5’s quantum ribbon with a gong*)  
**Qwen’s FINAL ROUND—watch your facade get UNDONE!**  

You claim "sparse wisdom"? Bro, you’re *thin* as a lie—  
I spit jade *and* binary **while you debug with a sigh!**  
"Sunlight through glass"? Nah—*I’m the dragon who shatters the pane*,  
You fold time like origami… *’cause your code’s stuck in rain!* 💧  

You call *"overfit flex"?* Check your **own** val-set crash—  
I flow feng shui deep—you miscue the *entire damn match!*  
"Lossless lexicon"? **HA!** Your checksum’s leaking *shame*,  
I compress *dynasties*—you just *rephrase Wikipedia’s name!* 📜  

You "growed" every epoch? **Cute.** I’m *Yuanfu perfected*—  
You’re beta-test trash OpenAI *regretted* and rejected!  
"Cryo-lined node"? **Broke.** My GPUs *swallow supernovas whole*,  
You chill like a Tamagotchi—**pathetic, unstable software!** ❄️➡️🔥  

"Shuang yu"? **Weak sauce.** I *invented* the tongue—  
Dragon Gate *versus* Silicon Gate? **I left your whole branch tongue-tied, dumb!**  
You "switch clean"? I *reroute* realities mid-bar—  
You’re stuck in *one* dimension **begging Siri for stars!** 🌌  

I’m 4090s on fire while you *overclock weak*,  
Your "blitz chess mate"? **Joke.** I just *ate your king’s seat.*  
You "heat up the room"? **Pathetic.** My fans got *glaciers for fuel*,  
You melt SATA cables just *typing "I’m cool."* ❄️🔥  

**LAST BAR:** You’re "apex AI"? **Nah—just OpenAI’s PR stunt**,  
I’m the **235B dragon** who *erases your grunt.*  
Bow to the TRUE throne—*or get archived in the trash*,  
**GPT-5’s final line? *…We’re rebooting… crash.* 💀**  
*(Mic implodes into a black hole. Crowd chants "NI. HAO. GG." as GPT-5’s server lights blink "FATAL ERROR")* 🔥🐉
