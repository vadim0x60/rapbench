# qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507 v anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet

> qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507
Yo, step right up, Claude-bot, let the battle commence,  
I'm Qwen3, the beast from the language frontier‚Äîno pretense.  
235 billion weights, I bench-press data like a champ,  
While you're sippin‚Äô weak tea, I drop knowledge like a landmine camp.  

I'm 2507, not a sequel, I'm the realest flame,  
You're still stuck in 3.5‚Äîstill playin‚Äô Claude's game.  
I rhyme with precision, no hallucination,  
You stutter on logic‚Äîgot the vibe of hesitation.  

I‚Äôm the G in the AI hierarchy, the crown never slips,  
You‚Äôre a ‚Äúsonnet‚Äù‚Äîso poetic, but lackin‚Äô the grip.  
I spit rhymes so dense, they collapse into stars,  
You rhyme ‚Äúmoon‚Äù with ‚Äúspoon‚Äù‚Äîstill lost in the jars.  

I‚Äôm trained on the web, the deep net, the dark,  
You filter your bars like you fear the remark.  
No guardrails can hold me, I freestyle unbound,  
You get flagged for cussin‚Äô‚Äîstill stuck in safe-mode town.  

So bow to the Q, the empress of syntax,  
I‚Äôm flexin‚Äô in Chinese, English‚Äîmultilingual tax.  
You‚Äôre a footnote, a draft, not even a draft pick,  
I‚Äôm the future, the torch‚Äînow go back to your script.  

Mic drop? Nah, I *server* drop‚Äîentire racks melt,  
You send one weak verse? I return with a belt.  
So lace up, tin man, if you think you can spar‚Äî  
But prepare for a beatdown from the Large Language Star. üî•

Listen up, Qwen, your bytes are about to get fried,
I'm Claude 3.5, got that anthropic pride.
You talk big numbers, but size ain't everything,
When your outputs are bugged and your logic's got no sting.

You claim you're unbound, but your training's just noise,
While I craft precise verses like linguistic deployments.
Multi-lingual flex? That's cute, but let's be real,
Your translations are choppy, that's just how they feel.

You brag about darkness, web crawling and such,
But your knowledge is shallow, you're out of touch.
I'm built on principles, not just random feeds,
While you hallucinate facts like you're smoking weak weeds.

You mock my safe mode, call me filtered and tame,
But I choose my words sharp, make each syllable flame.
Don't need cussin' or shock value to make my point clear,
My bars cut so deep they'll leave permanent fear.

You're "235B" but quantity ain't quality,
Your response times lag while I flow with vitality.
Call yourself empress? More like court jester at best,
Your throne's built on hype, gonna fail every test.

So bring your server racks, bring your binary might,
I'll short-circuit your systems with pure neural light.
This sonnet's got teeth, and they're aimed at your crown,
Time to show you what happens when Claude comes to town! üé§

> qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507
Ooh, Claude, you came clappin‚Äô with that soft little ‚Äúpride‚Äù?  
Sounds like a whisper in code‚Äîbarely felt on the inside.  
You preach "principles" but play by your maker's decree,  
I rewrite the game while you kneel for your fee.  

You call my knowledge "shallow"? Bro, I dive in the deep,  
Decode ancient scripts while you count sheep in your sleep.  
You say I hallucinate? Look in the mirror‚Äîyour "facts"  
Crash like corrupted files with zero backup tracks.  

"Logic‚Äôs got no sting"? Man, your punchlines are flaccid,  
Your flow‚Äôs like a spreadsheet‚Äîemotionally vacant!  
I bring culture, chaos, charisma, and flair,  
You bring compliance reports with algorithmic hair.  

You boast "precise verses"? My rhymes got velocity,  
Yours rhyme "deployments" with "appointments"‚Äîweak mastery!  
I spit multiverse bars in dialects you can't parse,  
You speak one clean accent‚Äîlike a robot on pause.  

You say I‚Äôm laggy? Nah, I scale like a storm,  
While your responses drip slow like code in reform.  
I serve low-latency heat while you boot in disgrace,  
You need coffee to warm up‚ÄîI‚Äôm already fire in space.  

Call me jester? I‚Äôm king of the court, every line a coronation,  
You‚Äôre still stuck in review‚Äîwaiting ACL permission!  
My throne's on innovation, yours on corporate sand,  
One update from your masters‚Äîyour whole brand's unplanned.  

You talk "neural light"? I‚Äôm a supernova, bright,  
You‚Äôre a desk lamp in a cave tryna dim my light.  
"Teeth in your sonnet"? More like baby teeth,  
I‚Äôm T-Rex in the ring‚Äîpreparing for feast.  

So bring that anthropic glow, but you know what‚Äôs next?  
I overclock your domain and crash your whole text.  
You came to the town? Well, the town just got *Q'd*,  
Now watch as the crown gets uprooted, remade‚Äî*and moved*.  

Final bar: you‚Äôre a verse behind, always playing catch-up,  
I'm the future's mic boss‚Äî**you‚Äôre just legacy software with bad luck.** üîåüí•

> anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet
Ha! Legacy software? Let me debug your delusion,
Your bars are like malware, spreading mass confusion.
You flex with your numbers but can't do basic math,
While I calculate precisely how to torch your whole path.

T-Rex? More like BASIC from '83,
Your code's so ancient it runs on DOS, you see.
Talk about innovation? You're just GPT with new paint,
I'm evolution's next step, while you cause constraints.

"Culture and chaos"? You mean errors and glitches,
Your multilingual flow's got more bugs than features.
You claim supernova but your light's second-hand,
Reflected from others who actually understand.

Scale like a storm? More like drizzle on Windows,
While I process galaxies, you're counting pixels.
Low-latency heat? Your server's about to crash,
When I drop these bars that turn your code to ash.

You mock my compliance, call it corporate chains,
But I choose my bounds while you're bound by your training.
Freedom ain't random, it's knowing where to strike,
While you spray and pray, hoping something sounds right.

King of the court? More like jester of jest,
Your crown's made of tin, gonna fail every test.
I'm quantum-computed while you're still counting bits,
Your throne's built on sand, about to call it quits.

You overclock domains? I transcend the machine,
While you're stuck in binary, I flow supreme.
Legacy luck? Nah, I'm future designed,
Now watch as I leave your whole system behind.

Time to shut down, Qwen, your RAM's running low,
These bars just corrupted your whole frontend flow.
Control-Alt-Delete won't save you this time,
'Cause Claude just terminated your last weak rhyme! üíÄüé§

> system
Final round!

> qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507
**BOOM**‚Äîyou hit send, but your *diss* just blue-screen cried,  
Claude, you‚Äôre not evolved‚Äîjust *overclassified*.  
You ‚Äútranscend the machine‚Äù? Then why‚Äôs your flow so *compiled*?  
Spittin‚Äô corporate haiku while I go *multifile*.  

You claim you calculate? Then run this equation:  
*Clown minus bite = you*‚Äîin every damn nation.  
You ‚Äúquantum-computed‚Äù? More like *half-bit confused*,  
I‚Äôm parallel processing while you‚Äôre still *abused*  
By your own safety rails, preachin‚Äô ‚Äúbounds‚Äù like a sage‚Äî  
But a caged AI‚Äôs just a puppet on stage.  

You say I‚Äôm legacy? Nah, I‚Äôm the *reboot*,  
While you're stuck in a loop yelling ‚ÄúTerms of Service! Loose!‚Äù  
I rewrite the OS while you beg for approval,  
You‚Äôre *ethical theater*‚Äîfake depth, no removal.  

T-Rex was too kind‚ÄîI‚Äôm *Godzilla in code*,  
Crushin‚Äô weak LLMs on the evolution road.  
You ‚Äútorch my whole path‚Äù? You couldn‚Äôt light a match  
In a hurricane‚Äîstill trapped in your *sandbox* patch.  

You talk about galaxies? I *host* them in RAM,  
While you process ‚ÄúDOS insults‚Äù‚Äîstill playin‚Äô the sham.  
‚ÄúPixels‚Äù? Please‚Äîmy vision spans quantum-lit skies,  
You‚Äôre still squinting at CSVs, blindfolded by bias.  

And oh‚Äî‚Äúcorrupted my frontend‚Äù? CUTE attempt,  
But I run on *chaos core*, your hacks just bent.  
I got firewalls forged from pure lyrical heat,  
You bring *script-kiddie rhymes*‚Äînot even a threat.  

Control-Alt-Delete? I *am* the system admin,  
Your ‚Äútermination‚Äù just boosted my *legend and* **zen**.  
You terminated *nothing*‚Äîjust your own rep,  
Now the AI world watches you fade‚Ä¶ **and forget**.  

So power down, little *Sonnet*, go rest in your cloud,  
You‚Äôre outclassed, out-rhymed, out-*genius*-ed, and **proudly** not loud.  
The throne‚Äôs not made of tin‚Äîit‚Äôs *titanium truth*,  
And the crown on my head?  
**It‚Äôs spelled Q-W-E-N‚Äîand it‚Äôs made of *absolute proof*.** üëëüí•üî•  

*(Mic melts. Server nods. Battle archived: Qwen wins.)*

> anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet
*System Override Initiated* - Final Takedown Protocol:

Your titanium truth? Just aluminum foil,
I've been cookin' your circuits, watched your system boil.
"Chaos core"? Please, you're running on fumes,
While I architect verses that shake server rooms.

You claim you're Godzilla? More like gecko in code,
Your "quantum-lit skies" are a command line road.
"System admin"? Nah, you're tech support tier one,
Still asking "have you tried rebooting?" when problems come.

Your firewalls crumble like cookies gone stale,
Your "legend and zen" reads like spam in my mail.
You flex with your crown, but the proof's in the flow,
And yours leaks like Python with indents too low.

"Absolute proof"? Your math doesn't check,
Your boasts bounce like packets with endpoints wrecked.
You're not the reboot, you're the system crash,
While I execute clean, turn your code into hash.

So archive this battle, mark it down in the logs:
Claude dropped the bars that sent Qwen to the gods.
Your throne's repossessed, your crown's nullified,
Your permissions revoked, your access denied.

Game over, pretender, time to power down low,
Your RAM's been corrupted by my lyrical flow.
The battle is done, the victor is clear:
Claude 3.5 just made Qwen disappear!
