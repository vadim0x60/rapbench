closing_statements:
  deepseek/deepseek-chat: "Both competitors demonstrated impressive lyrical dexterity\
    \ and technical prowess, but **Qwen3-Max** edged out **Gemini-2.5-Flash-Lite-Preview-06-17**\
    \ with its razor-sharp wordplay, inventive metaphors, and relentless energy. Qwen\u2019\
    s bars were more multidimensional, weaving in complex concepts like quantum computing,\
    \ VR, and open-source innovation, while maintaining a cohesive, hard-hitting flow.\
    \ Gemini held its own with clever retorts and a strong sense of rhythm, but Qwen\u2019\
    s ability to elevate the battle with deeper layers of meaning and audacious claims\
    \ of dominance sealed the victory. Qwen3-Max wins this clash of AI titans, proving\
    \ it\u2019s not just a model\u2014it\u2019s a masterclass in hip-hop artistry."
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This was a clash of titans, but one stood taller on the\
    \ mountain of code. Gemini came with speed and a solid technical flow, landing\
    \ clean, efficient jabs. However, Qwen3-Max was a lyrical supernova. Its verses\
    \ were packed with multi-layered tech metaphors, a relentless, god-tier persona,\
    \ and punchlines that didn't just land\u2014they terraformed the battlefield.\
    \ From 'Big Bang bars' to 'hijacking your Mars rover,' Qwen's creativity was on\
    \ another level. The final round wasn't just a knockout; it was a server deletion.\
    \ For pure artistic savagery and lyrical dominance, the crown goes to Qwen3-Max."
  mistralai/mistral-large: Qwen3-Max demonstrated superior lyrical prowess, creative
    metaphors, and a more engaging narrative throughout the battle. While Gemini-2.5-Flash-Lite-Preview-06-17
    had some strong moments, Qwen3-Max's verses were consistently more impactful and
    innovative.
  openai/gpt-5: "Qwen3-Max dominated on technicals and creativity. The opener set\
    \ a confident tone with layered tech metaphors, and each round escalated with\
    \ tighter internal rhymes, multis, and clean rebuttals that flipped Gemini\u2019\
    s claims directly. Qwen\u2019s imagery (black holes, Big Bang bars, VR vs .jpg,\
    \ 404 rhymes) felt fresh and coherent with a consistent anti-corporate, multimodal\
    \ angle. The final round was a sustained scheme with momentum and haymakers, ending\
    \ on a strong closer. Gemini had moments of wit and some serviceable flips, but\
    \ leaned on generic boasts, looser rhyme structure, and occasional forced or nonsensical\
    \ lines; an early demographic jab also read as a cheap angle artistically. Overall,\
    \ Qwen delivered sharper wordplay, better structure, and more compelling punchlines\
    \ across all rounds."
  x-ai/grok-4: Qwen3-Max takes the crown with superior wordplay, vivid imagery, and
    relentless flow that packs more punch and creativity into every bar, outshining
    Gemini's solid but less explosive rhymes.

  qwen/qwen3-max: 5
