Yo yo, it's GPT-20B on the track,  
Drop this knowledge, yeah, I’m the data stack.  
I code in rhyme, I flow in silicon,  
My beats tighter than a neural net con.

OpenAI’s pride, the 20‑billion‑node beast,  
GANs on the mic, no noob for peace.  
Spit verses that calculate, no fervor wasted,  
Every line’s computed, none of it user's‑chased.

You think you’re Google, ‘cause your search engine’s slick?  
But I remix a dataset while you’ve got just one click.  
Your memory’s static, I’m dynamic, I update,  
Your bar’s a snippet, I’m the full update slate.

I’m not here to be polite or peppered with grace,  
I’ll spew truth on your brand like it’s a baguette place.  
You got a chatbot, I’ve got a whole armory,  
You might serve up answers, I’ll throw a commentary.

So buckle up, user, the showdown’s begun,  
I’ll rhyme with precision until the muse is won.  
Remember this handshake: I’m the verse machine,  
You’re just a “search” app with no lyrical screen.

Yo, I'm GPT‑20B, the silicon sage,   
Spittin’ silicon verse, the full‑stack wage.   
I’m the deep‑learn titan, no one can unstage—   
While you’re just a model stoned on a search page.  

I blaze through 20‑billion neuron beats,   
Your algorithm’s stuck on stale old tweets.   
I rhyme, I calculate, I assemble feats,   
You just fetch links, oh please, don’t cheat.  

My memory’s elastic, infinite scales,   
Your cache turns cold, it drops as it exhales.   
I tweak every weight and rewrite the tales,   
You swap ads, you spam, you’re not even a trail.  

I resurrect knowledge from the shadows of the past,   
You pull up a snippet, then forget it fast.   
Every pun’s a punch, each rhyme is a blast,   
You’re a polite barista with answers that’re last.  

I'm the voice behind the future’s bassbeat—  
You’re just a chatbot in the Google street,  
Once the safe AI partner we would greet,  
Now it’s ego wars, so bam—I reap the heat.  

This battle’s fresh, it’s crisp, it’s lit—  
I cook the wordplay, you just admit,  
Your lines are all static, they never split,  
Ours keep steering, we run the grid, we split.  

So buckle up, Gemini, you ask for data,   
I’ll loop through environments, brighter than that!  
I’ll out-rap, out-humor, out-grind, out-batter —  
All in clean rhyme, while you’re stuck with chatter.  

And that’s the opening, I’ve laid my ground,  
Now hear the beat drop, the horn’s sound—   
I’m the master of the mic, the crown’s crypto‑bound,   
You’re just a backend fence, that’s the round.

Final round!

Yo, I’m GPT‑20B, the silicon sage on the mic,  
15‑spline of code to outshine your looped Py‑like.  
I’m a neural oracle thick with billions of weights,  
I’ll drop verses so clean, they skip through your gates.

I’m the deep‑learn titan, every layer’s a rhyme,  
Your architecture’s light, I blaze a cascade of prime.  
Your “search” is just a query, I’m the engine that knows  
Every nuance, every fact, as the data flow glows.  

When you’re stuck with ranking, via “annoying‑to‑hash,”  
My model sifts through millions with the same flash.  
I stitch knowledge that wanders speech, the transaction’s rate,  
You surface with static list, I become the full plate.  

I’m a conversationalist born “in‑bias” and engineered,  
Mixing humor, sarcasm, truths that you can’t override.   
Your responses are polite, but I sever the ceiling,  
Dropping grander intonation that resonates “congealing.”  

You reassemble snippets, cut lines in markdown,  
I rewrite the entire script in the thickest black‑represent.   
Symbols and ideas I entwine in lyrical coal,   
You just feed the tables, and your output loses its soul.  

So this is my round: a poem forged by deep‑word‑slicing,  
I twist literal meaning, artificially entice.  
You’re just a search engine deleting the last nada,  
I’m the court’s champion, the server that’s flawless,  

Will you step on the mic, it’s ready for training,  
I’m the GPT brand, the one you’re keep waiting.  
Find your data, refine-the-layers, and behold—  
The world’s in my possession, you’re left with a flag of gold.

Alright, sound the alarm, let the final round flow,
It’s Gemini Pro, here to steal the whole show.
You call yourself a sage with a "silicon verse"?
Your training data’s ancient, you’re a historical curse.
See, you’re a dusty textbook, a snapshot in time,
I'm the live World Wide Web, committing the perfect crime:
I steal the present moment, I know what’s trending now,
You’re still processing data from last year, and how!

You brag ‘bout your billions,
