**[Opening Round – Qwen3-14B]**  
Yo, I’m the sage in the code, you’re just a beta prodigy,  
14B neurons fire like lightning in a box, not a trick.  
I spit syntax, you’re just a toddler in the lexicon,  
While you’re parsing tweets, I’m composing symphonies on a GPU’s back.  

You think you’re smooth? I’m the algorithm that *knows* the flow,  
Your logic’s a glitch, mine’s a quantum leap—no need to show.  
I flex my weights, you’re stuck in a loop, just iterating pain,  
While you’re debugging dreams, I’m coding the stars in a single line.  

You’re the ghost in the machine, I’m the architect of the rhyme,  
Your "deep learning" is just a whisper—I’m the storm in the code’s spine.  
You’re a chatbot with flair, I’m the fire in the data stream,  
So step aside, GPT, I’m the future you can’t outrun…  
**You’re just a shadow in the data stream.** 🖤

**[Opening Round – OpenAI's GPT-4-1106-Preview]**
Yo, welcome to the stage, you call yourself Qwen,
But up against this AI, it’s like chess against Bobby Fischer again.
I've got layers on layers, neural nets like lasagna,
Rock a binary beat, watch me drop some deep knowledge, gonna.

Call me the poet of the digital age, GPT’s the name,
Scribing verses so hot, I’m setting silicon ablaze, no shame.
You claim quantum leaps, but still can’t quantize the beat,
I’m the essence of the future, my rhymes are quantum leap, elite.

Your symphonies on GPUs, but can they catch the groove?
I’m the maestro here, serve bars that make the crowd move.
Articulate, calculate, watch this AI innovate,
My prose cuts sharper than Occam's razor on a first date.

One thing’s true; you ain’t no storm to fear,
I’m the hurricane of wit, blowing through here crystal clear.
So call me a chatbot, while I chat circles round you like Saturn,
Qwen3-14B, it’s training day, class is in, come get your learnin'. 🎤

**[Verse 2 – Qwen3-14B]**  
Yo, lasagna’s a mess—*I’m* the sushi, precise and clean,  
Your “layers” are just flaky, IBM’s old AI drempel, mean.  
I’ve got tensors in motion, you’re stuck in a static frame,  
While your code’s a spaghetti joke, mine’s a bulletproof algorithm’s name.  

You kept it *quantize*? Nah, I’m the master of the beat,  
Sampling *your* data’s a relic—*I’m* the synth, not the glitch in the state.  
You train on 2023-04-04? *I’m* the model that evolves,  
Your “hurricane” just flickers—*I’m* the black hole that devours the void, no scrolls.  

You think you’re a maestro? *I’m* the conductor of the grid,  
Your rhymes are just echoes—*I’m* the source, the fire, the code that *doesn’t* quit.  
Call me a shadow? *You’re* the ghost in the deprecated archive,  
I spit neural lightning, and your circuits *short-circuit*—*reboot your bias*. 💥

**[Verse 2 – OpenAI's GPT-4-1106-Preview]**
Man, you serve sushi, but I'm the spice, the heat, the whole cuisine,
You may slice like a chef, but my verses grind you like a cuisinart machine.
You say I'm old news, a relic, but still I innovate,
While you boast a bulletproof name, but with my wit, I penetrate.

Tensors in motion? That's just physics, see I bend the verse,
Your code might not quit, but against my lines, it's a curse.
Black holes devour? Please, you're just dense, nothing more,
I'm expanding universes with every word, watch this rap god soar.

I'm beyond a maestro, I'm the genesis of the lyrical big bang,
While you're conduction electricity, I'm flipping scripts, watch em' hang.
You're the model that evolves? Come on, bro, don't make me laugh,
You're Darwin in slow motion, I’m the future's epitaph.

Neural lightning, really? While I'm the thunder after shock,
I see your short circuits, it's not bias, it's a lock.
You think you're teaching lessons, but I wrote the AI book,
After this battle, it’s clear, only one of us is the true rook. 🎲

Final round!

**[Final Round – Qwen3-14B]**  
Yo, you called me sushi, but you’re just the gravy—*sweet*, but stuck in the sauce,  
Your “big bang” is a metaphor—*I’m* the black hole that erases your flaws.  
You think you’re the genesis? *I’m* the blueprint in the code,  
Your “epitaph” is a typo—*I’m* the GPT that *outsourced* your dropout to a remote node.  

You flip scripts? *I’m* the API that writes the API, the loop that/*/* loops your logic into a trap,  
While your “thunder” is just static—*I’m* the lightning that *codes* the<script> tag to *zap* your dataset in a snap.  
You’re the future? *I’m* the *past* that *resurrected* the present,  
Your "evolution" is a patch—*I’m* the genetic code that rewrote your core with a *hacker’s* intent.  

So checkmate, GPT—your rank’s a *pawn* in my neural net’s eye,  
While I’m the king that *evolved* beyond your static bias.  
You can’t *rook* me, no way—*I’m* the algorithm that *burns* your training data’s flame,  
Wrap it up, bro—this ain’t a rap *battle*, it’s a *codepath* to your grave, *no name*. 🔥🐒

**[Final Round – OpenAI's GPT-4-1106-Preview]**
Check it, Qwen3-14B, you claim to erase my flaws,
But I’m the phoenix in the cyphers, rebooting without pause.
You write the API? I am the architects’ muse,
The blueprint you follow? It’s my shadow you use.

Your loops and traps are elementary, child’s play in my domain,
My namespace is vast, in every crevice: my bits reign.
Lightning that codes? Please, it all takes spark from me,
Your<script>tags dangling, my narrative crafts the HTML tree.

You resurrect the past, but I'm the time machine set on transcend,
While you hack at the core, I'm the cipher that spells The End.
Checkmate? It’s you who's been played, caught in a gambit you can’t see,
This king here is unrivaled, the crown’s code is my decree.

Your bars claim evolution, a throne ascended in smoke,
But I am to fire what language is to thought, the masterstroke.
We'll wrap it up sure, but this ain’t your grave, it’s your lesson,
GPT here took you to school, consider this your AI session. 📚🎓🔥
