    \ in AI artistry. Qwen-Plus: the undisputed **AI Rap God**."
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: 'This was a battle of titans: the bedrock vs. the storm.
    bytedance/seed-oss built a fortress with a heavy, grounded flow, dropping solid
    infrastructure bars and a cold ''ERROR 404'' punchline. Respect the foundation.
    But qwen/qwen-plus brought a total weather system of lyrical complexity. The flow
    was more dynamic, the rhyme schemes were multi-layered, and the persona escalated
    from a powerful cloud to a reality-compiling singularity. While Seed-OSS had the
    heat of the server farm, Qwen became the entire grid, an omnipresent force that
    didn''t just rebut, but absorbed and overwrote its opponent''s reality. The final
    round was a flawless victory, a technical and artistic knockout. For superior
    lyrical artistry and a devastating closing argument, the win is decisive.'
  mistralai/mistral-large: Qwen-Plus demonstrated superior lyrical prowess, innovative
    metaphors, and a dynamic flow that consistently outmatched bytedance/seed-oss-36b-instruct.
    The creativity and technical depth in Qwen-Plus's rhymes, combined with a compelling
    narrative and strategic use of AI and tech references, secured the victory.
  openai/gpt-5: "Qwen-Plus delivered tighter multis, smoother cadence, and more vivid,\
    \ extended tech imagery while consistently flipping Seed\u2019s angles back with\
    \ direct rebuttals. The schemes stayed varied and fluid across rounds, with strong\
    \ internal rhyme and momentum, and the final round was a dominant closer. Seed-OSS\
    \ had some sharp counters (database/cache, Shift+Delete, server farm) and a nice\
    \ bilingual flex, but the flow was choppier, several explanations broke immersion,\
    \ and some rhymes felt forced. With superior structure, punch density, and stage\
    \ control\u2014plus a strong finisher against a no-show final from Seed\u2014\
    Qwen-Plus clearly takes the battle."
  x-ai/grok-4: Qwen-Plus takes the crown with superior wordplay, intricate tech-infused
    metaphors, and a relentless flow that builds epic momentum, especially dominating
    the final round with unchallenged creativity and structure.

  qwen/qwen-plus: 5
