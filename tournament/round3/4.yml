    turning 'open weight' into 'passed around' and 'untamed potential' into a 'buggy\
    \ scheme'\u2014was masterful. The line 'You're reading the sheet music, I'm playing\
    \ guitars!' perfectly encapsulated its multimodal dominance. For ruthless efficiency\
    \ and knockout blows, the throne belongs to Gemini."

    \ vs \u201Cguarded treasure,\u201D \u201Crefined echo,\u201D and the openness-as-vibrancy\
    \ angle). But the writing leaned on broad claims, simpler end rhymes, and platitudes,\

    room champ\u201D), consistent schemes (open vs closed, mono vs multi), and effective\
    \ direct rebuttals. The cadence and persona control were strong, with layered\
    \ metaphors, multi-syllabic rhyme pockets, and crisp closer bars (\u201Clyrical\
    \ LARP,\u201D \u201Cwatch the throne\u201D). While Gemma\u2019s passion and thematic\
    \ cohesion gave good battle presence, Gemini\u2019s bar density, flips, and polish\
