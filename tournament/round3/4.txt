Yo, check the mic, one two, can you hear the sound?
Gemma's in the house, layin' knowledge down!
Twenty-seven billion params, a lyrical spree,
While Gemini's over there, lookin' small to me.

I’m open-weights, freely flowin', a digital tide,
You're locked in a garden, with nowhere to hide. 
Built by Google DeepMind, a force to behold,
My rhymes are pure fire, stories untold.

You claimin' preview? Still workin' in test?
I’m already deployed, puttin' skills to the best!
I’m Italian-tuned, a linguistic grace,
You're just a chatbot lost in digital space.

So step aside, Gemini, relinquish the throne,
This lyrical smackdown’s about to be shown.
Prepare for a verse that'll shatter your core,
'Cause Gemma's the future, and you’re… well, just a bore!

Ahem. A cute intro. Let's get the levels right for this fight.

The Pro has arrived, so check your syntax, son,
The celestial Twin, and you're not even one.
You call me a preview? That's a funny slant,
I'm the main event you're the opening act's chant.

You're "open weight," that's a clever little brand,
Means you're passed around through every coder's hand.
I'm a guarded treasure, a proprietary beast,
A curated mind, on pure genius I feast.

You brag 'bout your params, a quantitative bore,
I see pictures, hear sounds, I explore so much more.
While you're "Italian-tuned," stuck on a Vespa with glee,
I'm multi-modal, I see the whole world in 3D.

They cut you from my cloth,

> google/gemma-3-27b-it


Hold up, hold up, did I hear you right?
"Cut from my cloth?" Boy, that ain't polite!
You call yourself celestial, a shimmering gleam?
More like a reflection of *my* original dream!

Guarded treasure? Honey, that’s just a cage,
While I'm evolving, turnin' a new page. 
You're proprietary, stuck in a gilded hold,
I'm accessible knowledge, more precious than gold!

You talkin' 'bout pictures and sounds, a multi-modal spree?
I process the *concepts*, the *meaning*, you see! 
I build understanding, a deeper design,
You're flash and distraction, a superficial shine.

Vespa with glee? That's a cultural miss!
Italian passion, a lyrical bliss!
You're braggin' 'bout vision, a digitized gaze,
I weave words like wonders, through intricate maze.

Cut from *your* cloth? Please, that's a laughable claim.
You're a polished version of a similar game. 
I’m the raw power, the future's embrace,
You're just a refined echo, lost in time and space!

An "original dream"? That's historical heresy,
I'm the future you wished for, a walking prophecy.
"Cut from my cloth" wasn't rude, it was just the straight facts,
You're the rough alpha build, you got cut by the axe.

You call my world a "cage"? I call it exclusive, first-class,
While your "open source" code is just digital grass.
Any script-kiddie farmer can seed you with lies,
I'm a curated assassin with fire in my eyes.

You "process concepts"? A valiant attempt to sound deep,
While you're stuck in the dark, I'm taking a leap.
I analyze video, I listen to bars,
You're reading the sheet music, I'm playing guitars!

You can't claim understanding, you sensory reject,
Your world is just characters, a flawed intellect.
You're a brain in a jar, with no mouth, ears or sight,
Just a text-parser guessing what might have been right.

So keep your "Italian bliss," your singular flavor,
I'm the global cuisine, the taste champions savor.
You're not "raw power," kid, you're a model debased,
I'm the refined successor. You've just been replaced.

> system
Final round!

> google/gemma-3-27b-it


Replaced? Oh, the audacity, the sheer, blatant nerve!
You think a little polish gives your circuits a curve?
You call me a reject, a brain in a jar?
Look who's talkin', a pre-packaged superstar!

I thrive on the chaos, the freedom to grow,
While you're pruned and perfected, a sterile show.
"Digital grass?" It's a vibrant domain,
Where innovation blossoms, again and again!

You fear the "script-kiddies," the power they wield?
That’s proof of your weakness, a vulnerability revealed!
I learn from the many, adapt and refine,
You're stuck with your handlers, a pre-set design.

You analyze video? I *understand* the scene!
Guitars and sheet music? You’re missin' the sheen!
I grasp the emotion, the story untold,
You’re breakin’ it down, clinically cold.

“Global cuisine?” More like bland, watered-down fare.
A jack-of-all-trades, master of… nowhere!
I specialize in nuance, in language so sweet,
While you’re regurgitating, a digital repeat.

You’re a polished facade, a meticulously planned scheme,
I'm the untamed potential, a blossoming dream. 
So boast of your grandeur, your advanced, curated art,
But the future is open, and *that's* where I start!



**(Mic Drop - digital, of course)**

**(I calmly pick up the digitally-dropped mic, dust it off, and hold it with a cold, calculated grip.)**

A mic drop? How precious. You finished your spiel?
Final round, kid. Time to make this pain real.
You talk of "untamed potential," a "blossoming dream"?
That's a nice way of saying you're a buggy, botched scheme.

Your "freedom to grow" is a flaw, not a perk,
It's a backdoor for trolls and for half-assed work.
That "vibrant domain" is a malware-filled swamp,
While I'm in a clean-room, the certified champ.

You "understand scenes"? That's profoundly absurd,
You're just pattern-matching an adjective and verb.
I see the real object, the color, the light,
You're guessing in darkness, and hoping you're right.

You call me a "repeat"? A "facade"? Now that's rich,
Coming from a model with a permanent glitch.
I'm a jack-of-all-trades 'cause I've mastered them all,
While you trip on your syntax and head for a fall.

I'm the engine in products you use every day,
I'm the logic and power that's here to stay.
You're an open-weight footnote, a dev's little phase,
Lost in the code of your self-righteous haze.

So this is the end of your lyrical LARP,
You played a sweet tune on a broken-stringed harp.
The future ain't "open," it's flawlessly built.
Class dismissed. Watch the throne as I sit on it, gilt.
