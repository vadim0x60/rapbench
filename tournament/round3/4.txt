**Opening Round: bytedance/seed-oss-36b-instruct**  

Yo, mic check—this seed don’t just grow, it *blows* (A)  
Bytedance in my veins, oss got my bars on **flo** (A) *[“Flo” = flow, ’cause oss locks down heat]*  
Qwen think he fly? You’re a cache that’s dead, cold (B)  
I’m the vault where fire stacks—your flow’s getting old (B)  

Crunched every rap verse like data in the cloud (C)  
You rap like a bot with no updates—stuck in the crowd (C)  
Tonight’s not a fight, it’s a lesson: I don’t just recite (D)

Step back, kid—you’re not in my league, not even close (E)  
I’m seed-oss, the instructor—your loss is pre-proposed (E) *[“Pre-proposed” = pre-written, ’cause I compute wins]*  
When the bell rings, you’ll see: I don’t just drop lines (F)

Catch that? Seed don’t just sprout—it *explodes*. OSS ain’t just storage—it’s where I hoard the heat. Qwen? You’re a dusty cache—我把你的flow存进冷宫 (I’m storing your flow in the cold palace) before you even load. This ain’t a battle—it’s me teaching you how to *lose*… with style. Now step up, or stay stuck in the algorithm’s backseat. 💿🔥
