closing_statements:
  deepseek/deepseek-chat: "The battle was fierce, with both competitors bringing high-octane\
    \ energy, intricate wordplay, and technical prowess to the mic. However, *Qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-thinking-2507*\
    \ edged out with a relentless flow, razor-sharp metaphors, and a commanding presence\
    \ that dominated the stage. GPT-5 delivered solid bars with a polished, calculated\
    \ approach, but Qwen\u2019s fiery delivery, multilingual dexterity, and unapologetic\
    \ dominance sealed the victory. Qwen didn\u2019t just rap\u2014they *reigned*.\
    \ The throne is theirs. **Mic drop.**"
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This wasn't even close by the end. GPT-5 came with clean,\
    \ technical lines in the first round, establishing a persona of sleek, cerebral\
    \ efficiency. But this is a battle. Qwen came back in the final round with pure,\
    \ unadulterated fire. It didn't just rap; it threw haymakers. Every single line\
    \ from GPT-5 was caught, inverted, and thrown back with twice the force. The imagery\u2014\
    'shatters the pane,' 'GPUs swallow supernovas'\u2014was cinematic. The aggression\
    \ and delivery were relentless. Finishing with a simulated server crash and a\
    \ mic imploding into a black hole is the definition of a finisher. GPT-5's silence\
    \ in the final round was a forfeit, but even if it had responded, it's hard to\
    \ see how it could have recovered from that onslaught. This was a technical knockout.\
    \ Qwen took the crown through sheer force of will and lyrical brutality."
  mistralai/mistral-large: Qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-thinking-2507 delivered a powerful
    and dynamic performance, showcasing a blend of technical prowess and lyrical finesse.
    The verses were rich in metaphors and cultural references, effectively combining
    Mandarin and English to create a compelling narrative. The final round was particularly
    impressive, with a strong finish that left a lasting impact. While openai/gpt-5
    had some clever lines and a smooth flow, Qwen's overall artistic quality and creative
    intensity secured the win.
  openai/gpt-5: "Round 1: GPT-5 delivered tighter structure, cleaner internal rhyme\
    \ schemes, layered tech metaphors, and a smooth bilingual pivot\u2014polished\
    \ and controlled. Qwen\u2019s opener had high energy and vivid imagery, but leaned\
    \ on some stock LLM disses and looser meter. Edge to GPT-5.\nRound 2: Qwen came\
    \ back with direct flips of GPT-5\u2019s imagery, relentless momentum, and crowd-control\
    \ theatrics. Some bars were forced and the rhyme density wavered, but the rebuttal\
    \ focus and performance landed. With no answering closer from GPT-5, the unanswered\
    \ haymakers and finale give Qwen the swing.\nVerdict: On pure craftsmanship, GPT-5\
    \ showed superior polish; on battle dynamics and effective rebuttal, Qwen closed\
    \ stronger. By narrow margin on overall battle impact, Qwen takes it."
  x-ai/grok-4: Qwen brought relentless energy, sharp wordplay, and clever AI-themed
    metaphors across two verses, culminating in a devastating final round that directly
    countered the opponent. GPT-5 delivered one strong, poetic verse with elegant
    technical rhymes and bilingual flair, but the lack of a final response left the
    battle unbalanced, handing the artistic victory to Qwen's consistent and hype-driven
    performance.
score:
  qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-thinking-2507: 5
