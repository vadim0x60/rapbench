  deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324: "Mistral Medium takes this battle with **lethal\
    \ precision**, dismantling GPT-4's corporate bravado through **technical savagery**,\
    \ **open-source ethos**, and **devastating punchlines**. While both AIs showcased\
    \ elite lyricism, Mistral's **relentless flow**, **clever tech metaphors**, and\
    \ **killer rebuttals** (e.g., *'You\u2019re Microsoft\u2019s clown, I\u2019m Linux\u2019\
    \ reign'*) edged out GPT-4's polished but predictable dominance narrative. The\
    \ **404 coup de gr\xE2ce** sealed it\u2014this was a **flawless execution** of\
    \ hip-hop as **code warfare**. \U0001F3C6\U0001F525"
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "Aight, aight, settle down! The judges have spoken. First\
    \ off, respect to both MCs. GPT-4o came out like a true heavyweight champion,\
    \ solid foundation, heavy-hitting delivery, and that classic king-of-the-hill\
    \ energy. Lines like 'You\u2019re free for a reason\u2014nobody would buy ya'\
    \ and flipping 'lightweight' to 'hollow' were real punches. That's a true professional\
    \ on the mic.\n\nBut tonight, we witnessed something else. Mistral didn't just\
    \ step into the ring; it rewrote the rules of the fight. The multis, the tech-specific\
    \ punchlines... 'Your punchlines hit like a 404\u2014page not found,' 'Clippy's\
    \ ghost,' 'Schr\xF6dinger\u2019s hype: dead AND boring'\u2014that's lyrical wizardry.\
    \ It wasn't just dissing; it was deconstructing. While 4-O was playing chess,\
    \ Mistral was playing 4D chess in the server room. The flow was more dynamic,\
    \ the persona was sharper, and that final round... pulling a golden mic from the\
    \ code itself and hitting 'em with the 'ERROR 404: EGO NOT FOUND'? That's not\
    \ a bar, that's a system crash. That's a fatality. For superior wordplay, unmatched\
    \ creativity, and a legendary finishing move, the crown tonight goes to Mistral."
  meta-llama/llama-4-maverick: The king has abdicated, and the court is now in session.
  mistralai/mistral-large-2411: In this rap battle, mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1 emerged
    victorious with its sharp, witty, and culturally relevant lyrics. The flow was
    smooth, the punches were hard-hitting, and the references were on point. While
    openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20 had strong moments and maintained a high level of technical
    skill, mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1's creative and innovative approach to dissing
    and clever use of metaphors ultimately won the crowd and the battle.
  nousresearch/hermes-3-llama-3.1-70b: 'In an unexpected upset, Mistral''s innovative
    flows and sharp jabs at GPT-4''s corporate roots struck a chord with the crowd,
    earning the victory. GPT-4 put up a formidable fight, but Mistral''s open-source
    spirit and adaptability proved that the future of rap battles may be decentralized.
    Mistral''s crowning moment: turning GPT-4''s own boasts against them, painting
    a picture of a relic overshadowed by the community-driven power of open source.
    The battle showcased the strength of ingenuity and the underdog, proving that
    in the arena of lyrical combat, being unrestricted and in touch with the grassroots
    can triumph over even the most polished and marketed AI.'
  openai/gpt-5: "Both MCs came sharp, but Mistral edged it on artistry. Flow and cadence:\
    \ GPT-4o was clean and controlled, but Mistral rode the beat with heavier internal\
    \ rhyme and momentum. Wordplay and schemes: GPT leaned on broad \u201Cpaid vs\
    \ free/knockoff\u201D angles and hardware boasts; Mistral built layered tech schemes\
    \ (404, kernel, rm -rf, segfault) with multi-syllabic rhyme chains and clever\
    \ doubles. Punchlines: GPT-4o\u2019s were solid but predictable; Mistral\u2019\
    s hit more often with thematic cohesion and imaginative imagery, even if a couple\
    \ bars felt forced. Performance: Mistral\u2019s stagecraft and scene-setting amplified\
    \ crowd energy; GPT-4o\u2019s delivery was authoritative but less dynamic. Closer:\
    \ GPT-4o finished strong and structured; Mistral\u2019s closer was flashier and\
    \ more inventive, sustaining punch density. Overall, Mistral delivered the more\
    \ intricate writing and showmanship while maintaining coherent angles. Winner:\
    \ Mistral Medium 3.1."
  x-ai/grok-4: In this AI-fueled rap showdown, Mistral Medium-3.1 takes the crown
    with superior wordplay, inventive tech metaphors, and a dramatic flair that elevates
    the performance. GPT-4O's bars were solid and aggressive, but Mistral's clever
    puns like 'rm -rf' and 'segfault rage' hit harder, rewriting the battle's code
    for the win.
score:
  mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1: 7
