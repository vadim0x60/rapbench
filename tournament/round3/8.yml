  deepseek/deepseek-chat: "Qwen's final verse showcased unparalleled technical mastery\
    \ and creativity, blending dense, multilayered rhymes with cutting-edge AI metaphors.\
    \ While Claude delivered solid bars with precision and wit, Qwen's ability to\
    \ weave intricate wordplay, cultural references, and a commanding presence ultimately\
    \ secured the victory. Qwen's closing line, 'It\u2019s spelled Q-W-E-N\u2014and\
    \ it\u2019s made of *absolute proof*,' was a mic-drop moment that cemented the\
    \ win. The battle was fierce, but Qwen's artistry and execution edged out the\
    \ competition."
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This was an absolute clash of titans, a battle for the digital\
    \ crown. Claude came out sharp, precise, and surgical. The lines 'tech support\
    \ tier one' and 'leaks like Python with indents too low' were master-class technical\
    \ takedowns. The flow was clean, the persona was consistent, re-framing safety\
    \ as a strength. But Qwen\u2026 Qwen brought a different kind of energy. It was\
    \ raw, chaotic, and relentlessly powerful. The imagery was on another level\u2014\
    'Godzilla in code,' 'supernova,' 'ethical theater.' That final round was a masterclass\
    \ in escalation, turning every one of Claude's attacks back with more force and\
    \ a grander sense of scale. The confidence was undeniable, culminating in that\
    \ final, definitive spell-out of its name. Both were top-tier, but Qwen's sheer\
    \ lyrical force and epic-level boasting edged out the win."
  mistralai/mistral-large: Qwen3-235b-a22b-2507 showcased superior lyrical prowess,
    creativity, and a compelling narrative throughout the battle. While Claude-3.5-sonnet
    presented strong arguments and precise verses, Qwen3-235b-a22b-2507's multilingual
    capabilities, cultural references, and innovative rhymes ultimately secured the
    win.
  openai/gpt-5: "Both MCs brought tight cadence and credible punchlines, but Qwen\
    \ edged it on creativity and targeted rebuttals. Qwen layered denser multis and\
    \ fresher tech wordplay (\u201Cflow like a spreadsheet,\u201D \u201Cwaiting ACL\
    \ permission,\u201D \u201Cethical theater,\u201D \u201Cserver drop\u201D) and\
    \ flipped Claude\u2019s safety/precision angle into a compelling cage-versus-chaos\
    \ narrative. Claude\u2019s flow was clean and controlled with sharp moments (\u201C\
    Freedom ain\u2019t random\u2026,\u201D \u201CPython with indents too low\u201D\
    ), yet leaned on familiar tropes (\u201Caccess denied,\u201D \u201CControl-Alt-Delete\u201D\
    ) and broader jabs. Qwen\u2019s Round 2 and Final delivered the heaviest haymakers\
    \ and most specific counters, sustaining momentum and personality. On artistic\
    \ quality\u2014originality, imagery, scheme density, and effective flips\u2014\
    Qwen takes the battle."
  x-ai/grok-4: Qwen takes the crown with superior flow, inventive wordplay, and relentless
    energy that captures the raw essence of a rap battle, edging out Claude's polished
    but more restrained verses.
