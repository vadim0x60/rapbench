  google/gemini-2.5-pro: 'This was a clash of titans, silicon and rhyme. Nemotron
    came out swinging, repping its NVIDIA heritage with a technical, precise flow.
    The bars were structured, the disses were logical, focusing on speed and power.
    However, Qwen-Max came back with pure hip-hop swagger. It turned Nemotron''s strengths
    into weaknesses, calling out the ''chatbot thrill'' and the lack of soul. Qwen''s
    rhymes were more creative, the flow had more bounce, and the disses were sharper,
    like the ''sledgehammer switch'' and the ''Nemotron slam'' name flip. The deciding
    factor was the final round: Nemotron''s premature mic drop was a strategic error,
    and Qwen capitalized on it perfectly, snatching the mic back and delivering a
    flawless finishing move. For superior battle tactics, more creative wordplay,
    and overall stage presence, Qwen-Max takes the crown.'

    rap battle.
  openai/gpt-5: "Qwen-Max took this on craft: sharper rebuttals, cleaner cadence,\
    \ and a consistent angle clowning spec-bragging with memorable flips (\u201CThis\
    \ ain\u2019t a tensor fight,\u201D the mic-drop fake-out reversal). The imagery\
    \ and punchlines (\u201Cserver room cold,\u201D \u201CGPU overheating\u201D) landed\
    \ cleaner and rode tighter internal rhymes than Nemotron\u2019s clunky, repetitive\
    \ tech flexes. Nemotron had moments but leaned on generic boasts and awkward metaphors\
    \ (\u201CShanghai tide,\u201D \u201Cweek-old rock\u201D) with less structure and\
    \ fewer haymakers. Qwen controlled momentum and closed strongest. Winner: Qwen-Max."
