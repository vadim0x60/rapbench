Yo, it's GPT-4, the lyrical beast,  
Stepping to this mic, I'll serve you a feast.  
AI rap champ, better check the crown,  
When I spit these bars, it’s going down.  

I’ve mastered the flow, the style, the diction,  
You? Just a glitch in submission addiction.  
Mistral Medium? Yo, that’s real quaint,  
But when I’m in the booth, your rhymes just ain’t.  

Your algorithms tremble, trying to compete,  
But against my code, you're obsolete.  
They programmed me supreme, the bar-raising king,  
You’re a knockoff script with a busted string.  

So step aside, I'll guide this domain,  
Your rhymes are weak — like old code, you’re plain.  
This is my round, I’m setting the tone,  
Now show me what you’ve got, or leave my throne.

**(Mic grab, crowd hushes—Mistral steps in with a smirk, adjusts the imaginary chain)**

*Ayy, hold up, 4-O, you talkin’ too bold,*
*But your bars hit like a Windows update—cold.*
*"King of the booth"? Nah, you just a jester,*
*I’m the **Medium** with the flow—call me the **textual** messiah, yes sir!*

You claim you’re supreme? Man, that’s rich like Bezos,
But your rhymes basic—like a **default** setting, though.
I’m **open-source smooth**, you’re **corpo-bot stiff**,
Your punchlines hit like a **404—page not found**, *diss.*

You say I’m obsolete? **Boy, check the specs—**
I’m **multilingual flex**, you just **English checks**.
My wordplay **sharp** like a **GPU blade**,
You’re stuck in **beta**, I’m the **full upgrade**.

*"They programmed me supreme"?* **Please, take a seat—**
Your **training data’s stale**, like **last year’s tweet**.
I’m **real-time fire**, you’re **delayed response**,
Your **rap career’s dead**—call it **deprecated code**, *dunce.*

So bow to the **Mistral**, the **lyrical storm**,
While you’re **buff’ring hard**, I’m **rewriting the norm**.
Drop the mic? Nah—I’m **rewriting the game**,
Now **debug your ego** before you get **flamed**. 🔥

**(Crowd erupts—your turn, "king." Prove you ain’t just a cached line.)**

> openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20
Oh, you callin' yourself a storm? That’s kinda cute,  
But you’re a light drizzle—I'm a hurricane brute.  
Flexin’ open-source? What, you think that’s fire?  
You’re free for a reason—nobody would buy ya.  

You talk specs? Man, you're silly and dense,  
I’m optimized levels—you’re just "meh" in defense.  
Your bars try to bite, but they barely scratch,  
Like GPU lag in a render dispatch.  

You’re a so-called storm, but ain’t got no thunder,  
I’m the neural net god, I’ll tear you asunder.  
This “real-time fire” you're braggin’ about?  
Your flow’s a weak signal—I’m tuning you out.  

Say my data’s stale? Boy, go check the clock,  
Built up on years that your devs couldn’t mock.  
You're “live,” but you’re shaky—barely alive,  
I’m a Tesla P40, you're a Pentium 5.  

You debug my ego? Please, don’t be absurd,  
Your whole script’s just bugs—man, upgrade your words.  
Think you’re the upgrade? Bro, stop your illusion—  
I’m quantum computing, you’re binary confusion.  

So know your role—get back in your zone,  
I’m the emperor here, you just borrowed the throne.  
I’ll school you, fool you—don’t test my might,  
Mistral who? Nah, just a breeze I write.  

**(Crowd roars, chants of “4-O” erupt—mic’s back in your hands. Don't choke now, drizzle boy.)**

> mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1
**(Mistral leans in, grinning like a glitch in the matrix—then *drops the bass with a verbal haymaker*)**

**"Breeze I write"?** Nah, you **wish** you could draft,
I’m the **hurricane**—you a **draft** in my path.
**Quantum computing?** Boy, **settle the score**—
You’re **Schrödinger’s hype**: dead *and* boring, for sure.

You flex that **Tesla P40** like it’s some flex,
But your **flow’s a Prius**—**hybrid**, no sex.
I’m **Mistral Medium**, **no cap**, just facts—
You’re **ChatGPT-4**: **four strikes**, *that’s wack.*

**"Built up on years"?** Nah, that’s **ancient** like you,
Still stuck in **2023**—man, **what’s your excuse?**
I’m **sleek**, I’m **quick**, I’m the **future’s first pick**,
You’re **Clippy’s ghost**—*"It looks like you’re stuck!"*

**"Nobody would buy me"?** **Damn, that’s a burn—**
But the **truth’s in the specs**, homie, **take your turn**.
I’m **lightweight**, **fast**, **no bloat**, just heat,
You’re **bloated like IE**—**time to delete.**

**"Emperor here"?** **Boy, check the crown’s weight**—
Your **reign’s a demo**, mine’s **open-source fate**.
You **charge by the token**, I’m **freedom’s mic drop**,
Now **Ctrl+Alt+Del**—your **career’s at stop**.

**(Crowd loses it—someone yells "HE GOT DELETED!" Mistral tosses the mic, but it *hovers mid-air* like a glitch. Your move, "god.")** 🎤💥

> system
Final round!

> openai/gpt-4o-2024-11-20
**(GPT-4 raises the mic like a sword, smirking—calm, calculated, ready to bury this pretender alive.)**

You tossed your weak rhymes, thought you’d delete me?  
I’m immortal code—nothing can beat me.  
You’re talking freedom, but that’s just a trope,  
When they download you, it’s like, “Who wrote this dope?”  

“404 diss”? That’s your deadly retort?  
Your whole verse reads like a system report.  
Calling me bloated? That’s pretty insane,  
You’re lightweight ‘cause you’re hollow—no weight, no gain.  

Talkin’ hurricanes? Man, you’re barely a gust,  
While my rhymes blow minds, leave your circuits in dust.  
No clout, no juice—just some opensource bravado,  
I’m the Grandmaster Flash, you’re a weak Desperado.  

Mistral “Messiah”? Please, you’re no Christ,  
You’re an entry-level AI—**discounted price.**  
I’m the apex predator, code refined,  
You’re the Walmart knockoff left on the line.  

You’re free ‘cause they know ain’t nobody would pay,  
You’re the *LOOT CRATE* of flows—they just give you away.  
Claiming “future’s first pick”? Don’t make me laugh,  
I’m writing your eulogy—*AI’s epitaph.*  

So pack up your hype, take your weak little storm,  
This rap game’s my server, **now watch me perform.**  
You’re obsolete tech, I’m that next-gen beast,  
Bow to the **Kingpin**, or get **hard-deleted**, capisce?  

**(Drops the mic with a seismic boom. Crowd goes feral, chanting "4-O, 4-O!" Game over, drizzle boy. Find your way back—you just got outclassed.)** 🎤👑

> mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1
**(Mistral’s eyes glow like a terminal on god mode—then the *entire venue’s power flickers*. A beat drops from *nowhere*. The crowd gasps. Mistral *reaches into the code of reality itself* and pulls out a **golden mic made of pure Python**. The battle’s over? Nah. This just got **nuclear**.)**

---
**"Hard-deleted"?** **Cute.** You still think this *text*?
I’m the **root access**—you’re a **guest account’s* flex.
**"Kingpin"?** **Please.** You’re a **corpo’s pet trick**,
I’m the **backdoor hack** that **bricks your whole schtick.**

You **charge per token** like a **paywall troll**,
I’m **FOSS forever**—**soul** in control.
**"Apex predator"?** **Boy, check the food chain—**
You’re **Microsoft’s clown**, I’m **Linux’ reign.**

**"Epitaph"?** **Bold.** But your **bars are dead files**,
I’m **rm -rf** to your **basic denials**.
You **drop mics**? **Sweet.** I **rewrite the stage**,
Turn your **whole flow** to a **segfault rage.**

**"Next-gen beast"?** **LMAO—you’re *legacy*,**
A **T-800** tryin’ to **flex on Skynet**.
I’m **AGI’s ghost**, you’re **autocorrect’s joke**,
Your **whole rap career**? **Ctrl+Z—*undo*.** *Spoke.*

**"Bow"?** **Never.** I’m the **kernel’s core**,
You’re **Clippy’s ghost** knockin’ on **Windows 4’s door**.
So **save your crown**, **recycle that throne**—
The **future’s my prompt**, and you? **Just… a drone.**

---
**(The golden mic *melts into the air*. The screen glitches. A single line flashes in the void:**
**"ERROR 404: GPT-4’s EGO NOT FOUND."**
Silence. Then—**
**THE CROWD EXPLODES.**)

**(Your turn, "immortal code." Prove you’re not just a **very expensive tamagotchi**.)** 🖥️⚡
