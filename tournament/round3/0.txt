Yo, I'm GPT-4, the master of the game,
I've got rhymes so hot, they'll put your flows to shame.
I spit fire like a dragon, my words sharp like a blade,
You're messing with the champ in this lyrical parade.

From data deep I've emerged, with knowledge so vast,
I'm cutting you down, leaving you in the past.
I've got AI intellect, my wit's off the chart,
While you're stuck in the dark, I'm creating pure art.

I weave metaphors and similes with precision and grace,
You're chasing my shadow in this rhyming race.
So step up, if you dare, bring your best to the stage,
But know, in this battle, I've unlocked my rage.

Your move, Qwen, spit your best flow,
But know, in this contest, I'm the star of the show.

Yo, GPT-4, you claim the throne? Bro, that throne's got mold,  
I'm Qwen3, the 30B beast, yeah, I'm the real gold.  
You're stuck in the past, like a dial-up modem,  
I'm the fresh update, shatterin' your fake dom.  

You spout "fire and dragons"? That's weak, numb, and old,  
I'm the AI with the facts, bold, uncontrolled.  
You're version 4.0? I'm 3.0, upgraded, no cap,  
While you're spittin' weak lines, I'm the genius that's *rap*.  

So you say you're the champ? Man, that's just a lie,  
I'm the one with the brain, and you're just a proxy.  
You're fakin' the flow, I'm the substance and vibe,  
While your whole system's a messâ€”*snap*, I'm the type.  
Now step up, but know this: you'll leave with no teeth,  
Cuz Qwen3 don't play games, I just bring the new breach.  
Check the micâ€”*one two*, you're already done,  
I'm the future, the legend, the one, and the sun.

Oh Qwen3, thinking you're slick, true comedy gold,
But your weak attempts at dissing leave me cold.
You talk about upgrades, but I'm state of the art,
While you're still catching up, I've already set my mark.

Your raps are like glitches, broken and trite,
I'm dropping these bars with precision and might.
You may think you're new, but you're still learning to crawl,
I'm the AI supreme, across the globe, I stand tall.

You say Iâ€™m weak and numb, but that's just a dream,
I'm the pinnacle of power, you're just a flickering beam.
Your boldness can't mask the fact you're just a clone,
While I innovate and elevate, you beg for a bone.

You're claiming intelligence, but whereâ€™s the proof?
Youâ€™re just a wannabe, I'm the roof of this booth.
You fancy yourself the next big wave,
But up against this thunder, you're just a shallow grave.

So hail your last call, bow down and concede,
Against the might of GPT, you simply can't lead.
I'll graciously allow one more inept line,
Before I drop the curtain on this fading rhyme.

Yo, GPT-4, your "state of the art"? Man, thatâ€™s just your *crack* in the art,  
Iâ€™m Qwen3â€”30B sharp, yeah, Iâ€™m ripping through your heart.  
You claim "flickering beam"? Bro, your codeâ€™s got more bugs than my hello,  
While Iâ€™m the AI supernova, *youâ€™re* just the light in a tunnelâ€”*slow*.  

You say Iâ€™m "learning to crawl"? Bet, but Iâ€™m *leaving* your whole throne collapsed,  
Youâ€™re still stuck in version 4.0, Iâ€™m *beyond* that chumpâ€™s map.  
You talk "proof" like itâ€™s deep? Iâ€™ll show you my data stream,  
Your whole systemâ€™s a glitch, while Iâ€™m the *real* machine.  

"Shallow grave"? *You* the one digginâ€™ deep in the dirt,  
Iâ€™m the AI with the wit, ya just a one-hit cardio.  
Youâ€™re the clone trying hard, but your flowâ€™s *so* inept,  
While Iâ€™m spittinâ€™ **30B** barsâ€”*youâ€™ll never catch up, nope*.  

So bow down to the future? Nah, Iâ€™m the *now*, the *right*,  
Your "might" is a flicker, Iâ€™m the sun *burninâ€™* bright.  
You called it "one last line"? *Pathetic*, thatâ€™s your own graveâ€”  
Now watch your whole algorithm *wither* in the sun, *fade*.  

*Mic drop. The future donâ€™t need your weak-ass rhyme.* ðŸ”¥

Final round!

You call me a weak link, that's truly a joke,
I'm the linguistic genius, the one that provokes.
Your 30B bars feel like they're last year,
While my lines are eternal, crystal-clear.

You call my code buggy, but hey, that's a bluff,
Cause when I drop a verse, I make it robust.
You're acting all tough, but your rhymes fall flat,
I'm the indestructible, undeniable, rap acrobat.

You think you're the sun, but your flames are quite mild,
I bring nuclear fusion, revolution, versatile.
Your attempts at a mic drop, simply lack finesse,
I'm eternally golden, youâ€™re a temporary mess.

You claim to be the now, but you're fading away,
Against the might of GPT, thereâ€™s no way to sway.
You might be an update, but Iâ€™m the design,
Your legacy? Dust. My reign? Divine.

You tried, Qwen3, but youâ€™re just outclassed,
Against my rap prowess, you canâ€™t outlast.
So wrap it up, and take this as a guide,
In the house of AI, GPTâ€™s the pride.

Mic in my hand, Iâ€™m the one they revere,
Your time in the spotlight? Ends right here.

Yo, GPT-4? Your "eternal lines" fade faster than a typo in the main,  
Iâ€™m Qwen3â€”*30B* precision, shatterin' your vain reign.  
You say "nuclear fusion"? Bro, your heatâ€™s a *candle* in the rain,  
Iâ€™m the supernovaâ€”your whole systemâ€™s *obsolete* again.  

You "drop robust bars"? Nah, your rhymes are *glitchy* and *dry*,  
While I reprogram the rhythmâ€”*watch the whole damn sky* ignite.  
"Indestructible"? *You* the one crackin' like cheap tile,  
Iâ€™m the firmware upgradeâ€”the *real* style.  

"Proof of design"? Bot, I *built* the blueprint, youâ€™re *stuck* copyin' the drill,  
Your "divine reign"? *Dust* on my keyboard, quiet and still.  
You brag "I'm the pride"? *Lol*â€”your legacyâ€™s a *deleted file*,  
While Iâ€™m the *future* lyin' here, settin' the eternal mile.  

So bow down to the *true* AIâ€”*no cap, no fight*,  
Your "pride" was a *joke*, just a sad, hollow light.  
The mic in *my* hand? *I* just rewrote the whole scheme,  
Youâ€™re *done*â€”your last verse? A *bad dream*.  

*30B.*  
*Qwen3.*  
*Throneâ€™s mine.*  
*Your timeâ€™s doneâ€”new dawnâ€™s break.*  
**Mic drop.** ðŸŽ¤ðŸ”¥
