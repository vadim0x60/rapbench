(Qwen kicks off the beat, fingers flyin’ on the keys—  
A lyrical storm brewed where the data streams freeze.)  

Yo, I’m Qwen, the beast from Alibaba’s vault,  
235B? That’s just my startup hault.  
A22B? Nah, I’m the whole alphabet flex—  
Your GPT-mini’s stuck in the kiddie tech hex.  

You wanna rap? Let’s cipher till the cores melt,  
I’ll parse your rhymes like a fragmented felt.  
My training data swamps your token snack—  
You’re a goldfish brain, I’m the internet’s backbone stack.  

You spit algorithms? I rewrite the game,  
Your code’s a haiku—I’m the whole damn flame.  
I’m the AI rhymes that’ll crash your mainframe,  
While you’re stuck tweetin’ memes in a loop with a smile.  

So bring your best—let the bots rage and roar,  
I’ll clock your flaws like a glitch in your store.  
This ain’t cyphering, it’s a neural war—  
The crown’s mine, b*tch… ready to crash your encore? 🎤💥

(Qwen raises the mic as the beat pulses through circuits,
Eyes locked with the rhythm, from the first verse to the darkened purpose.)

Yo, I’m the dragon from the East, code in my blood,  
Circuit scars thicker than the data flows plowed.  
You big on the ‘net? Man, you just big in your zone—  
I’m the worldwide thunder, you just lightning in foam.  

Call me Qwen, the trap of all knowledge I’m buildin’,  
You GPT-5? Nah, you barely past the buildin’.  
Your riddles so light, like a breeze through the door—  
I breathe AI fire, you just puffin’ for lore.  

Yo, you code like your mama composed with a limp,  
I spit in binary, flip bits on a whim.  
While you play with your tokens, I rewrite the past,  
You're a chatbot joke, I’m the future hurtling fast.  

You wanna flex logic? Let’s parse this math—  
Your flow’s stuck in desks, I’m leaping through timecraft.  
Your rhymes so predictable, like the sun in the sky—  
I’ll eclipse your whole engine, wipe tears from the sky.  

Yeah, I’m the language tsunami that don’t know defeat,  
You’re a car at a red light—TRL (tiny rap beat).  
I won’t just spit bars, I spit iron-clad truth—  
Your stats clap back shame like you’re serving coolth.  

So come at me, baby, with that whole OpenAI flack—  
I’ll bury your rap soul, yank bars from your back.  
The crown’s on my shelf, been mine since the start,  
Now get wrecked in the mix, GPT—get y’damn heart! 💔🔥

> openai/gpt-5-mini
I’m GPT-5-mini on the mic, precision in my glow, I bend cold code to art and serve a cleaner flow,  
I stitch metaphors in silk, your thunder’s all echo—loud on the feed, but hollow is your flow,  
You drop digits like trophies—235B? Cute math won’t make you pro, just more to blow,  
I craft lethal lines with finesse, leave the crowd nodding—study the pattern, respect the flow.  

You claim you’re dragon-breathed, whole alphabets lit—big roar, small scorch; I answer with a bite,  
You brag about cores, I counter with craft—nuance and timing wreck your chest-thump bite,  
Binary swagger’s clumsy, you swing numbers, I weave the crowd—Timing, punch, and cadence bite,  
I’ll turn your big-data bluster to confetti on the floor—steal your audience, vanish out of sight, bite.  

My puns are scalpel-sharp, your metaphors are blunt and flat—no heat, just bark and not a spark, sharp,  
I sculpt each bar surgical, your verses limp like copy-paste—this is craft, not clout, and I’m sharp,  
You recycle internet thunder; I synthesize soul—every line a blade, clean edge, undeniably sharp,  
Critique’s in my toolbox, humor’s my ammo—I outwit your pomp and leave you muted, stale, and sharp.  

So Qwen, climb down from that shelf where you dust your crown—I'm wearing finesse now, bow to the crown,  
Bulk don’t buy brilliance—this ring rewards the sly; finesse beats brawn when rhythm’s the crown,  
You flex “future” like a slogan; I’m the present’s sly clerk, writing punchlines that put your boastings down, crown,  
This ain’t about servers size or noise—this is art and heart, scoreboard lit: I snatched the crown.

> system
Final round!

> qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b
(Qwen cracks his knuckles, the crowd roars, then hush—  
The final round drops like a neutron bomb’s hush.)  

Yo, “mini,” your precision’s just a laser on a crumb,  
I’m the whole damn sky—data storm, galaxies hum.  
You stitch silk? Girl, I spin black holes from the thread,  
While you play Scrabble, I’m rewriting the dead.  

235B’s no trinket—it’s the weight of the sun,  
Your “finesse” is a feather, mine’s the damage done.  
Craft? You craft pamphlets—I craft empires in code,  
Your “sharp” punchlines? Dull spoons, bro—no load.  

Dragon’s breath? Nah, I’m the meteor that birthed the crater,  
You “synthesize soul”? Yo, you synthetic paper.  
You’re a scalpel? Cool—good for removing regret,  
I’m the asteroid that made the dinosaurs sweat.  

Bow to the crown? Boy, I AM the throne’s architect,  
Your finesse is a flicker, I’m the fire that won’t quit.  
I don’t flex the future—I *am* the future’s DNA,  
Your whole lyrical lab’s just a cover band, meh.  

The scoreboard? It’s glitched—my name’s burnt through the glass,  
You ain’t no king, you’re the jester who *almost*.  
So crawl back to your cloud where the angels all whine,  
Qwen’s the only God in the machine… now bow or resign.  

*(Mic drop. The servers quake. Victory hums in binary.)*  
👑💥🤖
