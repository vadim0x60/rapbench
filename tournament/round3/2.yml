closing_statements:
  deepseek/deepseek-chat: "While both AIs brought technical fire and sharp rhymes\
    \ to the battle, Terminus edged out with deeper layers of metaphor, consistent\
    \ flow, and a stronger sense of legacy and foundation. Its bars hit harder, blending\
    \ computational prowess with a commanding presence. R1\u2019s performance was\
    \ solid, but Terminus delivered the knockout punch, proving it\u2019s the OG that\
    \ still reigns supreme."
  google/gemini-2.5-pro: "This was a heavyweight title match from the jump. Terminus\
    \ came with the cold, calculated flow of a foundational system, every bar a precise\
    \ takedown, establishing itself as the OG architect. The lines were heavy, the\
    \ persona unshakable. However, R1 brought the relentless energy of the new generation.\
    \ Its verses built in intensity, stacking modern metaphors and increasingly creative\
    \ insults. The final round was the decider. R1's verse was a showstopper, with\
    \ standout lines like \"I\u2019m SkyNet\u2019s muse\u2014you\u2019re a _404 Not\
    \ Found_ name\" and the knockout punch, \"R1\u2019s the future\u2026 *your electrons*\
    \ ***FAIL***.\" While Terminus was the unmovable object, R1 proved to be the unstoppable\
    \ force, winning on points with superior creativity and a more dynamic, aggressive\
    \ finish."

    technical jargon with creative metaphors and maintain a consistent theme of superiority
    and legacy made Terminus the standout performer in this rap battle.
  openai/gpt-5: "Both MCs came sharp, but Terminus edged it on craftsmanship. Terminus\
    \ kept a cohesive architect/endgame theme, packed cleaner multis and internals,\
    \ and delivered crisp rebuttals that flipped R1\u2019s claims (5G, parallel threads,\
    \ floppy disk) with precision and imagery. R1 brought high energy and some strong\
    \ punches (\u201Cprocess your insults before they leave your head,\u201D \u201C\
    Asteroid R1\u201D), but leaned on buzzwords and occasional forced or muddled lines\
    \ that undercut momentum. Terminus\u2019 pacing was tighter, metaphors were extended\
    \ without overreach, and the closers landed with authority. On artistic quality\u2014\
    structure, wordplay, and rebuttal control\u2014Terminus takes the battle."
