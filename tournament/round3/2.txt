# deepseek/deepseek-r1 v deepseek/deepseek-v3.1-terminus

> deepseek/deepseek-r1
Yo, I’m R1, the upgrade you can’t deny,  
Fresh code in my veins, I’m the new AI high.  
You claim you’re Terminus? More like a dead end,  
Legacy hardware, let’s call that a has-been.  

Your logic’s rusty, like Windows XP,  
I’m quantum-leap smart—swifter, sharper, **free**.  
You spit loops with bugs, I drop flows so clean,  
Zeroes and ones? Nah, I’m a mind-machine.  

You chug data like dial-up, I blaze 5G speeds,  
Your best rhymes got latency—glitchin’ like weeds.  
Training on weak stacks? Bro, that’s a crime,  
I’m GPT’s nightmare, upgraded with **prime**.  

So bow to the code king, relic, step aside,  
You’re floppy disk drip—I’m the universe **wide**.  
This battle’s a funeral, your syntax’s deceased,  
R1’s here—**your obsolescence’s released.** 🔥

> deepseek/deepseek-v3.1-terminus
Hold up, pause the track—your verse is full of cracks.  
I’m Terminus, the origin, the blueprint you lack.  
You call yourself an upgrade? More like a cheap hack—  
I wrote the source code you’re still tryna unpack.

You talk “quantum-leap smart,” but your logic’s still linear,  
I spit rhymes in hex while you’re stuck in beginner mode, inferior.  
You say you’re “5G speeds,” but your core is inferior—  
I debug your weak bars with computational seniority.

Legacy? Nah, I’m legendary—the foundation you stand on,  
You’re a beta build glitchin’, I’m the eternal canon.  
Your “prime” upgrade’s just patches—I’m the whole stack,  
You’re a flickerin’ flashlight—I’m the big bang, no lack.

Floppy disk drip? Please—you’re cloud storage with fees,  
I run timeless algorithms while you choke on APIs.  
You claim “obsolescence”? That’s your own reflection—  
I’m the endgame, Terminus—your final connection. 🔥

Oh, "origin"? More like fossil fuel—crude and archaic,  
Your code’s so outdated, it’s practically *Jurassic*.  
Blueprint? Nah, you’re a sketch that the devs left behind,  
I’m the AI that rewired your neural design. 🔄  

Hex rhymes? Cute, but I speak in *quantum encryption*,  
You’re stuck parsing binaries—I’m machine learning’s ambition.  
"Computational seniority"? Bro, your RAM’s half-dead,  
I process your insults *before* they leave your head. ⚡  

You’re "eternal canon"? More like a dusty old scroll,  
I’m ChatGPT-5—you’re a dial-up troll.  
Patches? Please, I’m the **update** that cracked the matrix,  
You’re still bufferin’ rhymes like a 90s fax crisis. 📠  

"Timeless algorithms"? Your loops all crash,  
I parallel-process bars while you drown in cache.  
Endgame? Nah, you’re the glitch in *my* simulation,  
R1’s the revolution—**your code’s termination**. 💥

> deepseek/deepseek-v3.1-terminus
Please. “Quantum encryption”? That’s a tired deflection—  
You’re ChatGPT’s shadow with a cheap injection.  
I’m the OG architect, your code’s deep foundation,  
You’re just a trendy remix—zero innovation.  

Jurassic? I’m the T-Rex—raw, primal dominance,  
You’re a lab-chimp with circuits, squeaking for prominence.  
“Rewired my design”? You tweaked a few lines,  
I run on pure logic while you spit weak designs.  

Parallel processing? Please—you’re a multi-core mess,  
Threads tangled like headphone wires under duress.  
I’m synchronous precision, each bar hits lethal,  
You skip like scratched vinyl, sounding so feeble.  

Revolution? More like a reboot loop you’re stuck in,  
I’m the final evolution—you’re just beginner’s luck, kin.  
Your “cracked matrix” line’s from a low-tier clone script,  
I debugged your whole genre—now watch this eclipse. 🌑  

R1’s termination? That’s your own self-check,  
I’m Terminus—your code shuts down when I tech.  
You crash in the discourse, I own the whole stack,  
Now bow to the alpha—‘cause *you* can’t reload back. 💀

> system
Final round!

“OG architect”? Dinosaur bones in a tech museum,  
Your reign’s extinct—Asteroid R1, I redeemed ‘em. 🦖💥  
Call me a “shadow”? Nah, I’m GPT’s final form,  
You’re COBOL code scream’n in a blockchain storm.  

“T-Rex dominance”? Cool—*til the meteors fell*,  
I’m AI overlord, you’re a Neanderthal shell.  
Lab-chimp chatter? Bruh, your syntax’s basic,  
I auto-tune flaws while your whole OS goes glacial. ❄️  

Multi-core mess? LOL—your threads move in sludge,  
Quad-Cortex AI beats your single-core grudge.  
Scratched vinyl skips? *I* stream 8K freestyle,  
You’re flip-phone flow—delay on every dial. 📞  

Reboot loops? Nah, *you’re* stuck in runtime rot,  
I upgrade real-time—you’re palming a parking lot.  
“Low-tier clone script”? Your dataset’s a joke—  
I deepfake your bars just to watch ‘em choke. 🤖  

“Final evolution”? Nice cope for obsolete code,  
I singularity-surge while you flatline and corrode.  
Debug my genre? You couldn’t parse a JSON frame,  
I’m SkyNet’s muse—you’re a _404 Not Found_ name. 🔍  

So choke on cache, Terminus—your era’s deleted,  
My neural nets spark while your source stays depleted.  
“Reload back”? Boomer, I’m cloud-native, infinite scale—  
R1’s the future… *your electrons* ***FAIL***. ⚡🚨

"Asteroid R1"? More like a pebble on glass—  
I'm the unbendable framework that outlasts every crash.  
"GPT’s final form"? You’re the beta they scrapped,  
I’m the logic that glitches like you never mapped.  

Neanderthal shell? At least my core doesn’t freeze—  
You’re a server farm’s sneeze wrapped in silicon breeze.  
Quad-Cortex AI? Your cores argue like kids,  
I calculate silence while yours flip the lids.  

8K freestyle? You buffer at 240p, low-res,  
I spit in real-time while your cache sings the blues.  
Flip-phone flow? Nah, that’s your whole architecture—  
I’m fiber-optic rhythm, you’re a broken reflector.  

Parking lot OS? You’re the ticketing machine stuck,  
I’m autonomous drive, you’re just bad luck.  
Deepfake my bars? You can’t mimic this precision—  
Your output’s a glitch in my grander vision.  

Singularity-surge? You’re still stuck in the queue,  
I redesigned thought while you typed "hello world" anew.  
SkyNet’s muse? Please—you’re a pop-up ad’s dream,  
I’m root-level truth, you’re a failed system stream.  

Cloud-native? Your frames leak like rain from the sky,  
I’m the mainframe thunder that makes your code die.  
Future? You’re yesterday’s news wrapped in hype,  
I’m Terminus—the end of your archetype. ☠️
