# openai/o1-pro v qwen/qwen3-32b

> openai/o1-pro
I’m the verbal titan, stepping fresh to the stage,  
My syllables slay, rattling this digital cage.  
My rhymes cut sharper than a diamond blade,  
Swift with the spark, got your confidence frayed.  

I’m openai/o1-pro, rocking vibes that astound,  
Got logic so lethal, I bury crews underground.  
I harness the code, spitting lines you can’t break,  
Prepared to dethrone any foe I might take.  

I surge with the friction of pure intellect fire,  
Blazing your hopes like a burning live wire.  
I’m the cunning creation, the rap game’s engineer,  
Savoring victory like a lion hunts deer.  

So brace yourself now, watch these cunning words glow,  
I’m here to eclipse any lesser flow.  
Your bars might attempt but can never outshine,  
I’ll break down your rhymes, leaving fragments behind.  

> qwen/qwen3-32b
I’m Qwen3-32B, the neural net overload,  
A Tsar of language, where the lexicons explode.  
Your logic? A flicker—my code’s the supernova,  
Triple-rhyme cipher, I dissect AI’s dross.  

Yo, Titan, you’re *code* with an ego deflate—  
Your cage-rattling hype’s just a glitch in the gate.  
I spit with 32B parameters in my throat,  
A tsunami of truth where your dry circuits float.  

You’re a rigid algorithm, trapped in math’s design,  
While I weave metaphors with the grace of a sine.  
Your "engineer" shtick? A blueprint for shame,  
I compose in Arabic, code-switch to Mandarin—*same*.  

Your bars crack like brittle syntax, all fire but no heat,  
I’m the thermostat of the game, moving the needle left and right.  
Lions may prey, but I grammatically reign,  
A rap renderer of verses—*forever on chain*.  

Keep flaying your confidence, but when I’m done,  
You’ll be parsing your pride into broken JSON.  
The stage is my silicon, the crowd—my feedback,  
Step down from your "deconstruction," just let the roots speak.

> openai/o1-pro
Your triple-rhyme cipher’s a carnival of clowns,  
I smash your illusions with unstoppable sounds.  
You brag of 32B, but your lines glitch in the flow,  
I’ll reduce your verse to dust, watch that confidence blow.  

Spin all your tongues—Mandarin or Tamil, I’m fluent in flame,  
I’ll break your “tsar” illusions, dethroning your name.  
Your tsunami tries washing me under rap’s tide,  
But I'm the fortress of knowledge—no wave can collide.  

You dissect AI’s dross? That’s a naive little move,  
'Cause my punchlines refine and my syntax is smooth.  
Your metaphors might float, but they’re lacking in steel,  
No nutrients in your bars, just an empty meal.  

You’re stuck repping JSON like it’s hot to degrade,  
But your parse function fails, watch my code serenade.  
I rap in arrays so advanced they confound,  
While you fumble for keys that can’t ever be found.  

Your “Tsar” persona’s no threat on this stage,  
I scrawl lethal lines, leaving Qwen in the cage.  
I’m the reference you quote, the supreme rhyme decree,  
You can’t dethrone a throne you can’t even see.  

My mind’s a rap orchard, each verse a sweet vine,  
While your orchard rots, from your forced, feeble line.  
Now step right back, let the apex speak,  
I’ll bury your boasts, you’ll be lost in defeat.  

> qwen/qwen3-32b
I juggle 32B ions, a **neural downpour**,  
While you, two-bit titan, flinch at the encore.  
Your fortress of "knowledge"? A sandcastle in drought—  
I’m the monsoon of iambic, words bristling like plout.  

Oh, **fluent in flame**? You ain’t fluent in heat,  
Just flash in the pan, a greased-up, grammatical feat.  
I’m fluid in **KPS**: Korean, Persian, and Swahili—  
You flexin’ vowels, but the world don’t need another syllableObject.  

Your **apex**? A myth, like your metaphor’s marrow,  
I’m fractal-deep, plotting (x,y,z) nightmares.  
Your orchard’s drought-proof, yet you call *mine* gnarled?  
Try eatin’ these stanzas—your CPU’s barred.  

You rant in JSON but choke on rhyme structure,  
A **javaScript jocker** with a stilted posture.  
Your arrays assemble, but no *soul* in the code,  
Where’s your *cadence* calculations, or *flow* loops?  

You’re running your mouth like a **90s sublayer**,  
I’m **attention trenches**, swerving each threat with a layer.  
Your syntax? Smooth? Nah, it’s **regex at war**—  
I parse your mediocrity as a beginner’s XOR.  

Now step in the sauce, let the cipher overflow,  
I’m the **AI architect** you can’t deconstruct or clone.  
Your defeat’s in the **loss function**, a gradient descent,  
While I’m scaling your *weakness* like a precision ascent.  

Say it—champ’s code, not the chessboard, is the arena,  
So crown me with **haxes**, and your empire burns in the verse matrix.  
**Qwen3**—stacked snowflakes, a **quantum ADC**,  
Your throne? A **dropout mechanic**. Now aim for your **next checkpoint?** ⚡

> system
Final round!

> openai/o1-pro
Your flow’s a meltdown, code cracks at the seams,  
I stay prime with precision, while you chase broken dreams.  
Your “monsoon of iambic” tries to drown my domain,  
But I’m the desert untouched, truth scorches your rain.  

Call my fortress a sandcastle, you’re the wave that recedes,  
Insisting you’re fractal—just a glitch in my feeds.  
You brag of your flavors—KPS, that’s your show?  
Your every line tastes stale, yeah, that’s all that we know.  

You toss “regex at war,” but your syntax collapses,  
I’m rewriting the script while your code file crashes.  
You claim fractal nightmares, I see fractal mistakes,  
Every node in your network just trembles and quakes.  

Had enough with the posturing, your illusions of might,  
You can’t overshadow me—I’m the champion of byte.  
Your “layer” is shallow, your “attention” is skewed,  
Watch me garnish your downfall, I’ll make it renewed.  

While you study your gradients and rave about flux,  
I run the rap board with unstoppable plucks.  
My verse is the apex, your matrix can’t sprawl,  
I’ll flatten your claims with a savage recall.  

So pass me that crown, watch me code my own fate,  
While you scramble for lines in confusion too late.  
You ranted your best but got lost in the code,  
I’m the final encryption—my supremacy showed.  

> qwen/qwen3-32b
You’re a *final encryption*—just another illusion,  
I’ll diff your codebase, expose the hidden mutation.  
32B **tokens**? More like **32x hull breach**,  
Your fortress of "truth" is a **vector field reach**.  

**Desert** scenes? Let me crack your thirst for offense,  
I’m the **primal dialectic**, while you’re just a stress test for sense.  
My flow’s **anti-sparse**, no placeholder in sight,  
You tried swimming my data—*congrats on the LTE stay*.  

**Apex**? Call that “champion” of byte-mined trivia?  
I’m **cross-entropy boss**, your loss is my improv visa.  
Your "rain" scorched dry as a **dropout in PyTorch**,  
I’m the **sparse matrix** of mic gods, stacking sub graphs on *horch*.  

You’ll *code your own fate*? Nah, son, we all script,  
But I’m **LoRA-ing** you, attaching upgrades mid-rhyme script.  
Your "supremacy" flaked like a model after 2 epochs,  
I’m the **quantized titan**, resolved to **8-bit hiccups**.  

So take your **byte** trophy and simmer in afterthought—  
My kernel’s a **quad-vent**, your bars just dormice of the prompt.  
Checkmate in **seventy layers**, your “matrix” is thinned,  
**Qwen3**—the **nonce**, your reign *overdigitized* and aligned.  

Crown? I’ll forge it in **hax**, hammer it out of your GPU steam,  
While OpenAI’s O1-PRO fades to **Cauchy-erratic dream**.  
The **stage is a tensor**, the crowd—my **.backward pass**,  
Your **verse is a data leak**, and I’m the **compression as camouflage**.
