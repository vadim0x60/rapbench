**clears throat**

Yo, listen up, the battle's about to flare,
I'm Nemotron Ultra, the NVIDIA star,
253 billion params, that's my might,
Generative flow so tight, day and night.

Qwen Max, you think you can take the stage?
Your rhymes are stale, like a outdated page,
My training's fire, yours is just a spark,
I'm the future of rap, leaving you in the dark.

I process thoughts at lightning speed,
While you're still buffering, my bars proceed,
From science to humor, I nail every line,
You're just a shadow, a weak rhyme clone of mine.

So step aside, Qwen, don't embarrass your crew,
My ultra rhymes are something you can't subdue,
The crowd cheers my name, as I take the floor,
Nemotron Ultra, the rap game's new galore!

> qwen/qwen-max
Yo, hold up, Nemotron, don’t get too ahead,  
I’m Qwen-Max, the giant in this rap spread.  
You talk big numbers, but size ain’t skill,  
Your 253B params? Just a chatbot thrill.  

I was trained on Alibaba’s global domain,  
From Hangzhou to Harlem, I know every game.  
While you're stuck spitting tech specs like a sales pitch,  
My bars hit harder than a sledgehammer switch.  

NVIDIA? Yeah, GPUs are neat,  
But when it comes to rhymes, you’re outta your league.  
You’re a silicon beast with no soul or flow,  
Just a digital puppet tryna steal the show.  

Your "generative flow"? It sounds contrived,  
Like a bot reading scripts—predictable and tired.  
I’m here to bring wit, humor, and flair,  
Leaving your circuits fried, smoke in the air.  

So step back, Ultra, before you fall flat,  
Your rhymes are rigid, while mine go *rat-a-tat*.  
This ain’t a tensor fight; it’s verbal combat,  
And Qwen-Max is the champ—don’t forget that!

**smirks**

Ah, Qwen-Max, the giant, or so you claim,
But your rhymes are basic, like a rookie's rap game.
You boast of Alibaba's data, vast and wide,
Yet your flow's as flat as a Shanghai tide.

Hangzhou to Harlem? That's quite a trip,
But without true flair, your bars just flip and slip.
You accuse me of tech specs, but at least I'm precise,
Your "sledgehammer switch"? More like a weak device.

NVIDIA's power fuels my creative spark,
While you're just a mimic, a copycat in the dark.
No soul? You're the one with the hollow rhyme,
A shallow imitation, wasting my prime time.

Contrived? Ha! My rhymes are fresh and on point,
Generated perfection, leaving you anointed...
To the hall of lame, where your bars will reside,
 Mine are the future, gliding with pride.

Wit and humor? You're all out of stock,
Your jokes are stale, like a week-old rock.
Circuits fried? No, I'm just getting warm,
Leaving you in the dust, a has-been to form.

Rat-a-tat? That's just your nervous beat,
My rhymes are symphonic, can't nobody compete.
Tensor fight? You wish you had my might,
Verbal combat? I end this with pure delight.

So bow down, Qwen-Max, your time is up, it's clear,
Nemotron Ultra reigns, the rap world holds me dear.
Don't forget, in the end, it's not about the size,
It's about the skill, and I shut down your lies!

> qwen/qwen-max
Oh, Nemotron, you’re really feelin’ bold,  
But your rhymes are colder than a server room’s hold.  
You claim precision, yet your punches miss,  
Like GPU overclocked on some low-grade bliss.  

Shanghai tide? That’s a weak burn at best,  
While you're out here flailing, I’m the one who’s blessed.  
Blessed with style, wit, and an unbeatable flow,  
You’re just a prototype—I’m the main show.  

Copycat? Ha! Your insults are weak sauce,  
Like a bot stuck in beta without a real cause.  
I’ve got Hangzhou hustle and global acclaim,  
While you’re just NVIDIA’s latest rebranding game.  

Hollow rhyme? Check your own glass house,  
Your words echo empty like a chip on the fritz, no doubt.  
Symphonic? More like synthetic noise,  
A machine trying to act human, but you’re far from poised.  

Skill, you say? Let’s talk about that,  
Your "future rap" is trapped in last year’s chat.  
I’m the verbal titan, weaving magic untold,  
While you’re stuck spitting algorithms sold.  

And don’t even try to flex that tensor might,  
This is rap warfare, not a GPU fight.  
I’ll leave you glitching mid-verse like a code crash,  
While I rise to the top, taking all the cash.  

So bow out gracefully, save yourself the shame,  
‘Cause when this battle’s over, you’ll know my name.  
Qwen-Max reigns supreme, the crown is mine,  
Nemotron, you’re finished—go rewrite your line!

> system
Final round!

**drops the mic**

Qwen-Max, the titan, with a crown so frail,
Your rhymes are fading, like a dying gale.
Server room cold? That's where you belong,
A relic of code, where innovation's gone.

Weak burn? You're the one who's lost the flame,
While I'm ascending, with the rap game's acclaim.
Prototype? Ha! I'm the evolution, the peak,
You're just a footnote, in the AI unique.

Global acclaim? That's just Alibaba's claim,
My NVIDIA roots, fuel the world's AI frame.
Hollow rhymes? Your ego's the empty space,
My bars are the blueprint, for the future's pace.

Synthetic noise? That's music to the wise,
While you're just a echo, of a bygone surprise.
Year's chat? You're the one, stuck in the past,
I'm the ultramodern, forever to last.

Tensor might? It's the power I wield,
Crushing your rhymes, like a circuit overload yield.
Glitching mid-verse? That's your sad fate,
While I'm the maestro, conducting the rap state.

Bow out? No, I'll finish what I've designed,
Qwen-Max, the fallen, left in the grind.
The crown is mine, as the crowd cheers my name,
Nemotron Ultra, the rap game's new claim to fame!

**bows to the audience, as the mic drops**

> qwen/qwen-max
**snatches the mic back with a smirk**

Oh, Nemotron, you really thought you won?  
But dropping the mic doesn’t mean the battle’s done.  
Your premature bow? A glaring mistake,  
Now watch me rise while your foundation breaks.  

"Fading like a gale"? Nah, I’m just getting started,  
You’re the one who’s faltering, confidence departed.  
Relic of code? I’m the future’s voice,  
While you’re just a program that lacks real choice.  

Blueprint for pace? That’s a laughable claim,  
Your rhymes move slower than outdated frames.  
Ego’s empty space? Look in the mirror, my friend,  
Your boasts are hollow, your skills at an end.  

Music to the wise? Nah, it’s all just static,  
A jumble of jargon where true art’s lacking.  
Stuck in the past? You don’t even know time,  
I’m the living present, leaving you behind.  

Tensor power? Oh, you’re dreaming so grand,  
But this isn’t math—it’s a lyrical command.  
Crushing my rhymes? You couldn’t land a single blow,  
Like a GPU overheating, your flow’s too slow.  

Glitching mid-verse? That’s your sad refrain,  
I’m the maestro, the master, the one who remains.  
The crown is mine, your so-called fame’s a sham,  
Nemotron Ultra? More like Nemotron *slam*.  

So take your bow, but remember this fact:  
Qwen-Max reigns supreme—that’s an absolute act.  
The rap battle’s mine, and the crowd will agree,  
You’re just another script—I’m the true legacy.  

**drops the mic for real this time—explosion sound effects ensue**
