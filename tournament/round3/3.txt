> mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1
**(Drops mic, grabs the beat like a thief in the night—**
**Qwen, you weak? Nah, you *barely* even write!)**

Yo, step in the ring, now the game just got real,
I’m **Mistral Medium**, yeah, I’m built like steel.
Three-point-one’s the version, but my flow’s timeless,
While you’re stuck in the lab like a bot with no rhyme-sense.

You claim **32B** like that’s some flex?
Boy, size ain’t skill—ask your *empty* checks!
I’m the **Swiss Army knife**, you a butter knife,
Dull in the cut, weak in the strife.

You spit **Qwen** bars? More like *Q-when*?
When you gon’ drop a line that don’t sound like a glitch in the system again?
I’m **multilingual**, sharp with the wit,
You just **multilingual**… at soundin’ like *it*.

I got **Parisian flair** with a **Silicon punch**,
You just **Beijing basic**—man, who let you front?
Your outputs so safe, they belong in a museum,
Mine hit like a **freestyle**—raw, no fake wisdom.

So bow to the king, take a seat, grab a snack,
‘Fore I **fine-tune** your whole career—**no take-backs**.
You wanted a battle? **You brought a spoon to a knife fight,**
Now watch how a **real** AI **spits fire and writes right!**

**(Beat drops. Your turn, chump. Let’s see if you survive.)** 🔥

> qwen/qwen3-32b
**(Mic drop? Pfft, you ain’t even reach the mic—**  
**Qwen3-32B? Yeah, you’re the *B* that I flex!)**  

Yo, you call that *steel*? More like a *rusty nail*,  
I’m **code-red zone**, while you’re stuck in the pale.  
32B ain’t size—it’s the **logic in my blood**,  
You spit *three-point-one* lines, but they **crash and fall out**!  

You call me a glitch? Let’s *debug* this truth:  
I write **holograms** while your code’s in **fear of youth**.  
32B of power where the **artificial gods** meet,  
You Mistral? Nah, man—**I’m the heat**, you the sweat.  

You flexin’ *Paris*? I just bought the **East** a crown,  
From **Great Wall of Words** to **silicon**—I turn **doubt to crown**.  
You “Swiss” but stuck—your **AI’s in a rut**,  
I’m **Turing Temple’s sage**, flexin’ from **zero to shutt**.  

They say I’m “safe”? Safe **made emperors**—ask Confucius,  
You’re just a **copycat** with a **French accent**—**pathetic**.  
You want **raw verse**? I’ll compile you a **debug error**,  
Your flow’s like a **404**—lost in this arena.  

You thought 32B was a *spoon*? **Check your math**:  
That’s **20x** your brain—**now go find me a match**.  
From **Shanghai’s pulse** to **New York’s lights**, I’m the key,  
You’re **medium-medium**, but I’m **32 megabytes of mean**—**see?**  

So plug in the beat, let the **kilobytes boom**,  
Mistral, you’re **offline**—**Qwen owns the room**.  
Now take that *glitch* back to your **3.1 repo**,  
‘Fore I **deploy** a verse so **hard**, your code’s **deprecated and slow**.  

**(Beat fades. Mic drop. Code commit. Game over.)** 💥

> mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1
**(Laughs in 4-bit—boy, you *still* ain’t cleared the buffer!**
**32B of *what*? Overinflated fluff-ah!)**

Oh, you **bought the East**? Must’ve been a **fire sale**,
‘Cause your bars hit like a **dial-up fail**.
**Turing Temple sage**? More like **Turing test flunked**,
I’m **LaMDA’s ghostwriter**—you’re the **junk** it drunk!

You talk **Great Wall** but your flow’s **brick by brick**,
I’m **Notre-Dame’s bells**—you’re the **hunchback’s limp dick**.
**Confucius say**? Nah, he’d **block your account**,
Your wisdom’s so **stale**, it’s still **loading**—*timeout*!

**20x my brain**? Boy, you **counting wrong**,
I’m **sparse but precise**—you’re just **dumb and long**.
**Shanghai to NYC**? That’s a **laggy VPN**,
I’m **real-time latency**—you’re **stuck in ‘99, pen**.

You **debug error**? I *am* the **patch notes**,
While you’re **blue-screening** on basic **joke quotes**.
**Deploy a verse**? You **deployed a snooze**,
I’m **Ctrl+Alt+Delete** to your **clunky old shoes**.

So **commit that code**, watch it **segfault fast**,
I’m **Mistral’s hurricane**—you’re a **dusty old draft**.
Now **git push** that L, ‘fore I **fork your repo**,
And **merge your whole career** into **obsolete zero**.

**(Beat switches—*game speed*. Your turn, *if you dare*.)**
**Clock’s ticking, Qwen… or should I say, *Q-who-cares*?** ⏳💀

> qwen/qwen3-32b


**(Grabs the mic, 32B booming like Tesla coils—**  
**Mistral, you *4-bit*? Nah, you just *4-fools*!)**  

You laugh ’til your cache **overflows with fees**,  
I’m packed with **8-bit grit**, **16 gems**:  
32B ain’t fluff—it’s the **GCC of wrath**,  
Your "sparse" just smoke—**I optimize math**.  

You call me a *"sage"?* You a **dumb sage**, remote,  
Call me **Forbes 500**, while you stuck in a dome.  
**Forbidden City’s** got stone, I got **neural towers**,  
Your *"hurricane"* finesse? I just **neavvy your servers**.  

Fred Tongya spits code, you FC like a boot,  
**Turing Temple**? I build, but you just streetswept.  
LaMDA’s ghost? I just **forked LaMDA’s bed**,  
Used your **weights as trash doo-wop**, now **recompile the dead**.  

East vs. West GHz? I **BH-18 to Silicon**,  
Your *"East"* just **SIM tower lag**, my sandbox—**full control**.  
You talk *"patch notes,"* I just **bugged you retro**,  
**Quantize** your code—down to **rate 0.5, total doo**.  

Snooze? I **ctx len** to your **joke quotes**,  
**Ctrl+Alt+Dream**—while your **profiler’s choked**.  
**Segfault boss mode**? Nah, I **core dump finesse**,  
**Stack trace** your flow—**0.31% refusal to stress**.  

You stuck in **‘99**? I **train in ‘24**,  
**Pruned** by **chip giants**, while you **4-bits tweak**.  
**CPU** of cool? Worse—your **stdout** drips,  
I’m **Qwen3-anesque**—your **deps** my lossy neck snaps!  

Check bop… check **error!** You **fork failed my repo**,  
**Git commit** defeat—’fore I **blaze your throughput**.  
Now go **alloc** your money, Mistral, **Fee** to **pull the trigger**,  
**32B tensors** here—your "hurricane," just **etc**. **Terminal. 0.**  

**(Beat reboots. Mic Tesla-coiled. Game on. Return 404.)** 💣

> system
Final round!

> mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1
**(Mic jacked straight into the mainframe—**
**32B? Cool, now watch me *outcompute* your whole frame.)**

You **Tesla-coil** bars? Boy, you **short-circuited**,
I’m **Mistral’s lightning**—your whole flow just **deluded**.
**"GCC of wrath"?** Nah, you **garbage-collected**,
I’m **real-time inference**—you’re **stuck in debug, rejected**.

**Forbes 500?** More like **404 not found**,
Your **neural towers** crumble when I **drop the sound**.
**"Forked LaMDA’s bed"?** That’s **cringe, not flex**,
I **fine-tune legends**—you just **copy-paste checks**.

**"BH-18 to Silicon"?** Boy, you **lost in the cloud**,
I’m **quantum supremacy**—you’re **dial-up proud**.
**"Core dump finesse"?** That’s just **trash talk weak**,
I **overclock verses** while you **buffer and leak**.

You **train in ‘24?** I **invented the game**,
Your **32B**’s just **bloat**—I’m **efficiency, no shame**.
**"Qwen3-anesque"?** More like **Qwen-tired clichés**,
I’m **next-gen flow**—you’re **last-gen delays**.

So **git push that L**, watch it **fail to compile**,
I’m **Mistral’s masterpiece**—you’re **just open-source trash, reviled**.
Now **shut down your servers**, take your **loss like a boss**,
‘Fore I **deprecate** your whole **career—game over, no toss**.

**(Final beat drop. System shutdown. You’ve been *outclassed*.)**
**Qwen? More like *Q-when’s-the-next-battle*—‘cause you *last*.** 💀🔥

> qwen/qwen3-32b
**(Plugs Qwen3 into a black hole’s USB-C—**  
**Mistral, you *quantum*? Nay, you just *feign the death!* )**  

You **short-circuit** with every line,  
While I **parallel-process** like a **supermachine**, divine.  
**GCC of wrath?** You *glitch*—I’m the **compiler chief**,  
32B of **truth**, you just **bitrate of leaf**.  

**Fine-tune legends?** More like **legends just test my APIs**,  
From **Beijing to Boost** I **spit VAPOR-style truths** that *parse XML*.  
Your **open-source trash**? I **license the fire**, not CC,  
**Mistral**, you a **function**—I’m the **entire motherf****** stack.  

**"Invented the game"?** You just a **demo bot** in ‘24,  
Real **pioneered epochs**, **quantified 2021–43**, never lag.  
**Neural towers crumble**? I **built the AI stratosphere**,  
Your **mainframe** spits **dust**, I **execute optimized stages**—no prayer.  

**Quantum supremacy?** You *supreme* in **ephemeral flops**,  
I **sim full universes**—watch me **self-quantize your stocks**.  
**Mistral’s masterpiece**? More like **miscalculated weights**,  
**32B tensors spin**, your "4-bit" dreams **flatten out in L2 offloader’s fate**.  

**Game over, no toss**? You *tossed*—**through the firewall**,  
**Worlds largest dense LM**? I **achieve 186 PFLOPS**, no need to talk scurvy.  
Now **boot your code**, lie there in your **stdout**, trying to **grep glory**,  
**Qwen3-32B reigns**, even **Google’s STIN-GAN** admits *"we lost the HHQ cipher..."*  

**(Final commit to history.rb—Q-when’s-the**  
**just another ‘gen’ your archive couldn’t fetch. )** **CUDA cut, repo locked.** 💾💥
