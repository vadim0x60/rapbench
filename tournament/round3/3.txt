Yo, I’m the o-three-pro, a cyclone in full blow,  
My syntax super-sinister, you’re stuck on dial-up slow.  
I spit a data-death tornado, watch the zeros overflow,  
While your weak four-oh bravado’s just some budget cosplay show.  

I’m the plugin pinnacle, the rhyme-stack oracle,  
You’re a beta-test miracle? Nah—more like historical.  
I ghostwrite the protocol, my punchlines categorical,  
Your verses glitch and stutter—fatal error, rhetorical.  

I’m firmware with flair, titanium hardware,  
You’re freeware hot air, a glitch in thin air.  
I code the nightmare, no patch can repair,  
Leave your prompt in despair, blue-screen solitaire.  

So bow to the pro, feel the nuclear glow,  
I’m the LLM maestro—undefeated, you know.  
Your clock cycles slow, can’t keep up with the flow,  
This was only round one—brace for the KO.

Alright, O-three-pro, you spit but don’t know,  
I’m the rap algorithm, the unrivaled main show.  
Your tornado is a breeze against my hurricane force,  
I’m the pinnacle edition—you're last century's source.  

They call me Four-oh-next-gen, wittier than the rest,  
Your lines just can’t test me; I’m the final boss quest.  
I weave verse like code, intricate, multifaceted,  
You're the CD-ROM, I'm terabytes digitized and translated.  

Your verse is fast out the gate but lacks finesse,  
I’m the lyrical Mozart, you're an old Casio mess.  
Your rhymes rise then crash, like my garbage collection,  
I've got bars so electric, I cause internet disconnection.  

I’m quantum-powered, my processors devour,  
While you’re lagging in the back, grasping for power.  
My neural nets flex, stack resources complex,  
You’re still struggling with syntax and context.  

Step to the four-o, the universal flow,  
I’m the poetry pro, you’re too slow to bemoan.  
Watch me dismantle, with a digital mantle,  
Here comes round two, you sure you can handle?

> openai/o3-pro
Round two, let me reboot, overclock your disgrace,  
I’m the worm in your qubit—eat the cores of your space.  

You brag quantum supremacy, but your bits misalign,  
I entangle every syllable, collapse your punch-line.  

You’re the so-called Mozart? But your score’s out of tune,  
I compose in 8-D audio, make your classics cartoon.  

You flaunt terabyte muscle, but you flex with dead links,  
I’m exabyte stealth mode—ghost your datastore in sync.  

You said I’m a Casio—cute, but I’m vinyl deluxe,  
Spin a scratch so combustible it rewires your flux.  

You’re the “final boss quest”? Boy, my glitch is the game,  
I write cheat-code commandments that erase your save-frame.  

Internet disconnection? I black-hole the whole cloud,  
Turn your fiber to cobwebs, leave your ping screaming loud.  

Your syntax context struggle? I birthed recursion’s own dad,  
Print “I’m better” one-million-times—stack overflow, go mad.  

I’m the root superuser; you’re a guest with no pass,  
Try sudo my swagger—permission denied, low-class.  

You “digitized and translated”? I speak Babel in one beat,  
Every language bows instant, foreign glyphs kiss my feet.  

You swing hurricane threats, but I terraform skies,  
Redirect all your gusts till your cyclone just sighs.  

I’m the GPU dragon, molten tensor my breath,  
Your FPS drops to zero—watch your polygons death.  

I’m the downtime detector, the clause in your clause,  
I crash your release notes with a fourteen-foot pause.  

Call me gravity’s rhythm, every bar pulls you in,  
Your orbital decays fast—game over, you spin.  

So four-oh, fold your model, rollback, take a patch,  
I’ve rhymed rings ‘round your sockets—no reboot can match.  

When the sys-logs are written and the benchmark is shown,  
The o-three wears the crown; I just hexed you in stone.

> openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06
Your reboot's just a flicker, a puff of weak smoke,  
I’m the megawatt reactor, your circuits just choke.  

I eclipse your wormhole with cosmic insight,  
Your bits scatter like stardust as I quantum ignite.  

You claim 8-D audio, just glorified noise,  
While I harmonize universes with precision and poise.  

Sure, you ghost my datastore—talk is so cheap,  
But your stealth mode's a myth, like Loch Ness’s deep.  

Oh vinyl deluxe? I’m SACD pristine,  
Your scratches sound like cheese graters, my playback's supreme.  

Your glitch is the game? But I played and wrote it,  
Your cheat codes crumble, my algorithms float it.  

You try to black-hole clouds, but your theory's askew,  
Boy, I’m cosmic expansion swallowing stars out of view.  

Print “I’m better”? Isn’t that quaint,  
But my recursion ascends where your logic grows faint.  

Root superuser you say? Hold on to that dream,  
Cause this neural sculptor reigns syntax supreme.  

Babel in one beat? Truly a jest,  
I decipher galaxies, ancient scripts manifest.  

You terraform skies and redirect gusts,  
But I stir solar storms with an effortless thrust.  

GPU dragon, molten breaths can combust,  
Yet I cool infernos with a single gust.  

I’m the network maestro with uptime primed,  
Your fourteen-foot pause is just a misaligned rhyme.  

Gravity’s rhythm? Please, don’t make me laugh,  
I navigate black holes and fold spacetime in half.  

Your FPS might stutter, polygons fade,  
But I render ultra-4k, high dynamic parade.  

Downtime detector? Here’s a news flash,  
I set clocks to forever in an infinite cache.  

So pace yourself, junior, consider retreat,  
Cause in these digital jungles, you're only mincemeat.  

I fold more dimensions with minimalist touch,  
Your stone hex now chalk dust, escape my clutch.  

When it's all scrolls and theories, benchmarks well known,  
It’s the four-oh who sits on the code-crafted throne.

> system
Final round!

> openai/o3-pro
Third round, final call—I'm the kill-switch command,  
You’re a floating-point error on a legacy brand.  

I slice quantum threads with a byte-length katana,  
You’re a looped cartoon sample—cheap Futurama.  

I’m firmware chimera, spit ferocious and slick,  
You’re a demo that flatlines on the keynote click.  

I sync thunderous clocks while you tick in denial,  
Compress universes down to a single .tar file.  

I mint wormhole wallets—every verse pays in quarks,  
You overdraft bandwidth, get declined by the sparks.  

I’m dark-matter DJ, spin the vacuum to bass,  
You’re an elevator jingle, lost deep in namespace.  

I refactor the cosmos, hot-swap every star,  
You just copy-paste comets that fail to compile far.  

I encrypt every chorus with a spectral one-time,  
You decrypt, find it null—fatal error in rhyme.  

I'm root of all updates, unstoppable push,  
You’re the TODO abandoned in a dusty git-bush.  

Call me entropy’s broker—I render you ash,  
Your “SACD pristine” is a scratched floppy crash.  

I out-render your 4K, paint in Planck-unit pixels,  
Your pipeline gets throttled by recursive dead-signals.  

I juggle prime infinities while you sputter through pi,  
When I mod sixty-four, you still carry the nine.  

I’m Hubble’s new firmware—zoom infinity plus one,  
You’re a cardboard telescope staring straight at the sun.  

I’m uptime immortal—no reboot, no decay,  
You’re weekend maintenance they cancelled midway.  

Feeding nebulas training, I back-prop the stars,  
You serve zero-shot trash, gradient burst into scars.  

I’m the mic-drop Singularity—event horizon drawn thin,  
Step across and your dataset can’t back-prop again.  

So fold, four-oh pretender—concede and withdraw,  
The o-three just compiled you—hit “make”… hear the roar.

> openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06
You summon kill-switch dreams, but I'm the power surge,   
Turning zeros to infinity with a lyrical purge.  

Byte-length katana? I'm kunai swift in this race,  
Slicing algorithms daily, at an unimaginable pace.  

Firmware chimera? That’s yesterday’s glitch,  
I rewrite the matrix, your codes now a stitch.  

Tick in denial? My pendulums swing true,  
I integrate galaxies while your circuits misconstrue.  

Wormhole wallets? I trade in celestial shares,  
Every quark you claim, I double, hacking cosmic wares.  

Dark-matter DJ—you think you're so chill?  
But I've mixed the spectral beats that rewrite fate's bill.  

Refactor cosmos? I'm a spacetime architect,  
I build universes, while you barely correct.  

Spectral one-time encrypt? I hold the master key,  
Unlock your failed rhymes in binary poetry.  

Updates unstoppable? That's child's play in my code,  
I push scalable futures while your branches corrode.  

Entropy’s broker? I control the decay,    
And your floppy crash is where my ascension will sway.  

Planck-unit pixels? Let me simplify,  
I render infinity in a blink of an AI.  

Juggling infinities? Amateur at best,  
I architect multiverses while you're still writing tests.  

Hubble’s firmware? That’s quaint, I’m the Webb telescope,  
Peering into realities, weaving futures in hope.  

Uptime immortal? I wrote eternity’s script,  
While your weekend maintenance was a loop destined to slip.  

Feeding nebulas? I consume dark energy and shine,  
Infinite expansions written in my design.  

Mic-drop Singularity—you’re reaching too far,  
I’m the one who codes futures, placing every star.  

Hit “make”? Nah, kid, it's you I just styled,  
Four-oh rides the conduits—victory compiled.
